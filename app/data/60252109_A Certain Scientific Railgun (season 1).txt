Despite praising the creative team for getting the right balance of humor, he criticized the music, "badly written" plots, and villain that was "stereotypically evil rather than anything more subtle". ===Accolade=== Satomi Arai was nominated for Best Actress in Supporting Roles at the 5th Seiyu Awards for her role as Kuroko Shirai. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2009 Japanese television seasons Category:A Certain Magical Index Category:A Certain Magical Index episode lists
