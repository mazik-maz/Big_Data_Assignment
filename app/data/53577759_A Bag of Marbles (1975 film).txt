A Bag of Marbles () is a 1975 French film based on the 1973 autobiographical novel Un sac de billes by Joseph Joffo.Annette Insdorf, Indelible Shadows: Film and the Holocaust, 2003, , p. 370: "A Bag of Marbles (Un sac de billes, 1975), on the other hand, is the story of two Jewish children who must move from Paris to southern France. Directed by Jacques Doillon, it is really the story of Joseph (Richard Constantini), tracing his development from incapacitating fear to first love and courageous action." Doillon made use of mainly non-professional actors, as also in his next film with children, La Drôlesse (1979). Among the non-professional actors, the father - who is captured and sent to Auschwitz - is played by Jo Goldenberg, owner of the famous deli at 7, Rue des Rosiers in Paris's Jewish district, which 7 years after the film was the site of the Chez Jo Goldenberg restaurant attack. == Cast == * Richard Constantini : young Joseph * Paul-Eric Shulmann : young Maurice * Joseph Goldenberg : their father * Reine Bartève : their mother * Hubert Drac : Henri * Gilles Laurent : Albert * Michel Robin : Mancelier * Dominique Ducros : Françoise * Stephan Meldegg : sous-officier salon de coiffure * Axel Ganz : officier salon de coiffure * Pierre Forget : the teacher * Marc Eyraud : priest on train * Hélène Calzarelli : young girl on train * Yves Wecker : Raymond, le passeur * Bernadette Le Saché : la réfugiée * Antonino Faa Di Bruno : le vieux beau * Antoine Neri : l'Italien de la bargue * Max Vialle : le concierge * Dominique Besnehard : le moniteur * Alain Peysson : Ferdinand * Hans Verner : l'officier allemand * Dieter Schidor ==References== Category:1975 films Category:Films directed by Jacques Doillon Category:Films scored by Philippe Sarde Category:French drama films Category:1970s French-language films Category:1970s French films
