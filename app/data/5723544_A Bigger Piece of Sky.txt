A Bigger Piece of Sky is an album by Texas-based folk singer-songwriter Robert Earl Keen. It was released in the United States in 1993 by Sugar Hill Records and re-released in SACD format with the originally intended track sequencing in 2004 by Koch Records. The title of the album comes from a line in the opening verse of "Paint the Town Beige": :I gave up the fast lane for a blacktop country road :Just burned out on all that talk about the mother lode, :I traded for a songbird and a bigger piece of sky :When I miss the good old days I can't imagine why. The album is frequently cited to be one of Keen's best if not the best and is considered to be a transitional point in his career as an artist."Robert Earl Keen-The Irony and Humor by Don Henry Ford Junior, AmericanaRoots.com, December 8, 2005[ Review:A Bigger Piece of Sky] by Thom Jurek, AllmusicCountry Music Review: A Bigger Piece of Sky by Matt Bjorke, about.com The album brings together various elements of alternative country such as roots-rock, honky tonk, and folk to form Keen's own cohesive blend of Texas music. Reviewers cite "Corpus Christi Bay", "Whenever Kindness Fails", "So I Can Take My Rest", and "Paint the Town Beige" as stand-out tracks. Keen's down-beat duet with Irish singer Maura O'Connell, "Night Right for Love" is also worthy of note as is Keen's cover of Terry Allen's "Amarillo Highway". Other guest performers include Marty Stuart on mandolin and Garry Tallent on electric and upright bass. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Musicians: * Robert Earl Keen - lead vocals and acoustic guitar * George Marinelli - harmony vocal on "Paint the Town Beige", and electric guitar * Tommy Spurlock - acoustic guitar, steel, lap steel, and gut string guitar * Garry Tallent - Electric bass and Upright bass * Dave Durocher - harmony vocal on "Corpus Christi Bay", drums and percussion * Jonathan Yudkin - violin * Marty Stuart - mandolin * Jay Spell - accordion * Michael Snow - additional vocals on "Blow You Away", bodhran, and tenor banjo * Bryan Duckworth - violin on "Crazy Cowboy Dream" * Dave Heath - upright bass on "Crazy Cowboy Dream" and harmony vocals on "Jesse", "Amarillo Highway", and "Crazy Cowboy Dream" * Maura O'Connell - duet vocal on "Night Right for Love", harmony vocal on "So I Can Take My Rest", and additional vocal on "Blow You Away" * Jennifer Prince - harmony vocal on "So I Can Take My Rest" Production: * Produced - Garry Velletri (except "Amarillo Highway" by Garry Velletri and Dave Durocher) * Recorded - Jeff Coppage, July 1992 at The Board Room, Nashville, Tennessee * Mixed - Jeff Coppage and Garry Velletri * Digital editing - Neal Merrick at Merrick Music Studios * Mastered - Denny Purcell at Georgetown Masters Artwork: * Cover - "Slow Poke" by Ray C.
