A Bird in a Gilded Cage is a short 10-minute Australian television play. It was one of the rare Australian dramas at the time. It was the first screen credit for Patricia Hooker who in 1960 called it "just a 10-minute Victorian melodrama... but it's a good start and has inspired me to begin another television play - a half-hour effort this time." Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. ==References== ==External links== *A Bird in a Gilded Cage at IMDb *Bird in a Gilded Cage' at AustLit Category:Australian television plays Category:1957 television plays
