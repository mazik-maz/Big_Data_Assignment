There was something special about being in the nation's capital on Independence Day, surrounded by a few hundred thousand of our fellow citizens."Eblen, Tom. "Tom Eblen: Being at A Capitol Fourth made me proud to be an American", Lexington Herald-Leader, July 9, 2013 ==History== The National Symphony Orchestra began performing Independence Day concerts on the west lawn in 1979. Two years later, the first concert telecast was hosted by E. G. Marshall, with conductor Mstislav Rostropovich and performer Pearl Bailey. It is now the highest-rated show on PBS.Yahr, Emily. "'A Capitol Fourth's broadcast reflects the new Americana: A reality TV parade of stars", The Washington Post, July 3, 2013"Creation of a National Institution", A Capitol Fourth, PBS, accessed July 12, 2013 In 2019, the concert was held alongside Salute to America, a separate Independence Day event organized primarily by then-President Donald Trump. The organizers of A Capitol Fourth indicated that their show remains an independent production that is not affiliated with Trump's event. In 2020, the in-person concert was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, although some performances were still recorded live remotely. The special instead incorporated pre-recorded performances (including one that paid tribute to first responders), although the fireworks on the Capitol were still broadcast live. Although restrictions have since been lifted in Washington, D.C., the in-person concert was cancelled again for 2021, as the show had already been planned in advance under the presumption that the in-person concert could not be held. In 2022, after two years of cancellation of the in-person concert, the show returned to the West Lawn of the Capitol. ==Cast== ===Hosts=== Tony Danza has served as host twice, in 1998 and 2007.
