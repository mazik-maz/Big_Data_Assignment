A Broadway Cowboy is a 1920 American silent Western comedy film directed by Joseph Franz and starring William Desmond. It was distributed by Pathé Exchange. ==Plot== As described in a film magazine, Betty Jordan (Francisco), daughter of a Montana banker, is in the East attending boarding school and falls desperately in love with Burke Randolph (Desmond), a matinee idol, who performs valiant deeds behind the footlights each night in the title role of an old-fashioned melodrama, The Western Knight. She is expelled from school after Burke treats a chaperon rather roughly during an automobile ride. When Betty returns home to Montana, Sheriff Pat McGann (Delmar), who is in love with her, finds a picture she has of Burke in his cowboy suit, and in a fit of jealousy sends copies of it out to the other neighboring sheriffs with the request that Burke be arrested on sight. When his show hits a small western town, Burke is arrested. He manages to escape, and in a series of exciting incidents accidentally captures four desperadoes who in the prior night had robbed Betty's father's bank. Burke is proclaimed as a hero and wins Betty as his bride. ==Cast== ==Preservation status== * The film is preserved at Filmmuseum Nederlands (EYE Institut). ==References== ==External links== * * * Lantern slide Category:1920 films Category:Films based on short fiction Category:1920 Western (genre) films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Pathé Exchange films Category:Films directed by Joseph Franz Category:Silent American Western (genre) films Category:Films with screenplays by George H.
