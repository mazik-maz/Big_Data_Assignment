A Beautiful Day is a live album by American jazz pianist Andrew Hill recorded in 2002 at Birdland in New York City and released on the Palmetto label.Andrew Hill discography accessed October 1, 2010 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by David R. Adler awarded the album 4 stars and stated "this remarkable live album... boasts a large ensemble, billed at Birdland and previous gigs as the Andrew Hill Sextet + 11. Despite a large regiment of horns, Hill's reflective piano figures prominently... With its wide array of available textures and juxtapositions, the big band proves an ideal vehicle for Hill's powerful, unclassifiable music".Adler, D. R.
