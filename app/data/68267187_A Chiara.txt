A Chiara () is a 2021 Italian-language drama film directed and written by Jonas Carpignano, the third film in his film trilogy set in a Calabrian town, following Mediterranea (2015) and A Ciambra (2017). The film stars Swamy Rotolo, Claudio Rotolo, Grecia Rotolo, and Carmela Fumo and had its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival on July 9, 2021, in the Directors' Fortnight section, to very positive reviews. Following its festival screening, the film was distributed by MK2 Films and Lucky Red in Italy and Neon in the United States. ==Plot== The Guerrasio family and friends gather to celebrate Claudio and Carmela's oldest daughter's 18th birthday, despite a healthy rivalry between the birthday girl and her 15-year-old sister, Chiara. However, later that night, a car explodes on the family's street and Chiara witnesses her father fleeing. Everything changes the next day when the family patriarch disappears, and Carmela acts as though there is nothing to worry about. Chiara, unconvinced by the news story and her mother's low-level panic, finds a secret door in her living room and begins a deep investigation into her family, discovering ties to the mafia and the criminal underworld. The following day, a social worker picks up Chiara at school and puts her in foster care to protect her from her problematic family. As she gets closer to the truth, she is forced to decide what kind of future she wants for herself. ==Cast== * Swamy Rotolo as Chiara * Claudio Rotolo as Claudio * Grecia Rotolo as Giulia * Carmela Fumo as Carmela * Giorgia Rotolo as Giorgia * Antonio Rotolo as Antonio * Vincenzo Rotolo as Enzo * Antonina Fumo as Nina * Giusi D'Uscio as Giusi * Patrizia Amato as Patatina * Concetta Grillo as Celeste Tripodi * Koudous Seihon * Pio Amato * Iolanda Amato ==Production== On June 19, 2019, it was announced that Jonas Carpignano was set to write and direct his third film, A Chiara, a follow-up to his 2017 feature A Ciambra.

The site's critical consensus reads, "A willingness to sidestep clichés and a skilled central performance help A Chiara stand out in the crowded coming-of-age genre." On review aggregator Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 75 out of 100 based on 18 critic reviews, indicating "generally favourable reviews". In a positive review for Variety, Jay Weissberg wrote that "A Chiara allows Carpignano an opportunity to turn his generous gaze on another ignored segment of Calabrian society, one whose values — family, mutual support — can't be dismissed because we're uncomfortable with how they exist side-by-side with a sense of ethics that stops at the bounds of kinship." He also praised the cinematography and original score, saying "Tim Curtin's dynamic camera is attuned to Chiara's teenage energy without going overboard, playing on a liminal balance between security and imbalance. Carpignano uses music to even more forcefully reflect Chiara's life, though its omnipresence risks driving the film's moods rather than eliding with them." The Hollywood Reporters David Rooney called the film Carpignano's "most accomplished and affecting film to date" and "a companion piece that takes rewarding new turns" in another positive review.
