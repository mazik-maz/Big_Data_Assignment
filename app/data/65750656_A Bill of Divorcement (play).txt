A Bill of Divorcement is a play by English author Clemence Dane. It was her first play, and her most popular, and was adapted to films of the same name three times, in 1922, 1932, and 1940. ==Synopsis== Though it was premiered in 1921, the play is set in the early 1930s. Margaret Fairfield divorces her husband, who has been in a mental hospital for many years, in order to remarry. Their daughter cares for the father and faces the fact that his mental illness may be hereditary. Although not permitted at the time in Britain, the play imagines a future where divorce is permitted where a spouse is incurably insane. Due to evolving cultural views, divorce was a popular subject in novels and drama of the time.D'Monte, Rebecca.

Broadway producer Charles Dillingham had decided to try producing a serious drama in New York for the next season (instead of his customary musical comedies) and agreed to take it on. In America, the play was premiered at George M. Cohan's Theatre on October 10, 1921. Despite good reviews, audiences were slow to grow. The Cohan theatre had already planned to mount a new show when Divorcement began to grow popular, so the show was moved to the Times Square Theater on November 7. It closed in March 1922, after a total run of 173 performances.Mantle, Burns, ed. The Best Plays of 1921-22, pp. 63-95 (includes extended excerpts from the play)(11 October 1921).
