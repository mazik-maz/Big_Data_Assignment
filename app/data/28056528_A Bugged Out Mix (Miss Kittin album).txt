Stephanie Kale from Exclaim noted, "The range of what Miss Kittin mixes truly reveals her talent for bringing disparate styles and rhythms together in a way that makes sense." Likewise, Scott Colothan from Gigwise.com said that "the main strength in this album is its sheer unpredictability and refusal to adhere to the build-up/release formula inherent to many live sets." == Track listing == === Disc One: Perfect Night === === Disc Two: Perfect Day === == Personnel == * Artwork (Cover Design) – Bente Schipp * DJ Mix – Miss Kittin * Mastering – Craig Dormer, Richard Tugwell Source: == Charts == Chart (2006) Peak position Belgian Compilation Albums Chart (Wallonia) 18 French Albums Chart 170 == References == Category:Miss Kittin albums Category:2006 compilation albums Category:Rough Trade Records compilation albums
