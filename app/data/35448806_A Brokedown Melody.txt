A Brokedown Melody is a 2004 documentary surf film from Woodshed Films directed by singer/songwriter Jack Johnson and his film school friend Chris Malloy. Presented as a special screening to benefit the Kōkua Hawai'i Foundation at the Hawaii Theatre in Honolulu on August 11, 2004, the film had premieres during the fall of 2004 at the Malibu International Film Festival (MIFF) on September 16, 2004, at the Laguna Beach Festival of Arts during the 2nd annual Moonshine Festival on October 9, 2004, at the Arlington Theater in Santa Barbara in October, 2004, and at the Hawai'i International Film Festival (HIFF) in Honolulu in October, 2004. It is the fourth of The Moonshine Conspiracy films. Combining a wide range of styles of guitar music for the soundtrack, the film captures award-winning cinematography from surfing footage of various locations worldwide: Chile, Hawaii, Mexico, Jamaica, Tahiti in French Polynesia, and Indonesia. Surfers in the film include Tom Curren, Gerry Lopez, C. J. Hobgood, Rob Machado, and Kelly Slater. Also, Jeff Johnson, Jack Johnson's father, and a very youthful John John Florence make special appearances. ==Cast== In alphabetical order: *Mark Cunningham *Tom Curren *CJ Hobgood *Jack Johnson *Gerry Lopez *Rob Machado *Chris Malloy *Dan Malloy *Emmett Malloy *Keith Malloy *Kelly Slater ==Synopsis== The film explores the times, travels and experiences of a tribe of surfers who search for the spark of life and look to pass it on to the younger generation.
