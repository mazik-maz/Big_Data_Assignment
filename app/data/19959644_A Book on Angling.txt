A Book on Angling – Being a complete treatise on the art of angling in every branch is a work of angling literature with significant fly fishing content written by Francis Francis, angling editor to The Field and published in London in 1867 by Longmans, Green and Company. ==Synopsis== A Book on Angling is best described by the author himself in the preface to the first edition: > When first infected with the fever of Angling, more years ago than I care to > count up, my ambition was to catch every species of freshwater fish, from > the minnow up to the salmon, which inhabits our British waters. That > satisfied, my next desire was to write a work, which should contain within > one volume (as far as might be possible) the fullest and most varied > information upon Angling generally, in every branch of the art, which had > ever been published; and with this resolve I commenced collecting the matter > for the present work nearly twenty years ago. Taken up and laid aside from > time to time, little by little it has steadily progressed towards > completion. In the course of that twenty years I took occasion to visit and > to fish nearly every river of note in the kingdom, my connection with 'The > Field' affording me peculiar facilities for obtaining permission to fish > very many waters which are closely locked against the general public; and I > have roamed England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland over to gather fresh > knowledge, and to put it into a practical and concentrated form for the use > of my readers. > In inducting the tyro into the mysteries of the art, I have endeavored to > make every direction and information as clear and practicable as possible. > This work is intended to be a useful and not merely a decorative one: thus, > the plates are not for the sake of ornamentation, but for direction, and as > an aid to the student of tackle-making and fly-tying. Each illustration of > tackle is really needed, and the flies shown are not a mere selection of > gorgeous and pretty subjects, or I should have chosen very differently; but > each fly is a specimen of some separate class of flies, in which a special > peculiarity of manufacture is evident. > I have to thank many kind friends for assistance in lending tackle and flies > as subjects for the engravings, and also for description, as will be found > in the body of the work. > I have given much time to this book, but I have given it willingly, for it > was indeed and in truth a labour of love. Whether the Angling public, to > whom I dedicate it (desiring no more potent patron), will appreciate my > labours remains to be seen; and so, without further apology if an attempt to > supply a long-felt and obvious want, the existence of which few persons have > been in a position to know and feel so well as myself, be thought to require > an apology into their hands I commit it. > FRANCIS FRANCIS.
