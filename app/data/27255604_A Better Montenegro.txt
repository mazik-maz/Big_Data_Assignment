Milić had negotiated with Montenegrin President Filip Vujanović on the participation of the opposition, which boycotts elections considering them illegal and unjust because of the flaws in the electoral law which should have been reformed when new Constitution was brought up in 2007 and they made a deal to organize general local elections in the remaining 14 municipalities all round which still haven't had elections since independence. The coalition won more than 50% of votes only in Pljevlja municipality.DPS-u 12 opština, bez većine u Podgorici == Composing parties == Party Party Abbr.
