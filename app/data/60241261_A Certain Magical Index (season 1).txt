J.C.Staff was announced to be producing the series, while Hiroshi Nishikiori, who previously worked on Angelic Layer: Mobile Angel, Masanao Akahoshi, who wrote several episodes of Sky Girls, and Yuichi Tanaka were confirmed as director, series composition writer, and character animation designer, respectively. Kazuma Miki, the light novel editor, wanted to make changes during the process of adapting the light novel into anime but felt a "double-edged sword" when thinking how to bring "Kamachi's color" to it and what fans would find interesting. Nishikiori laid out the concept of "following the original story" instead and aimed to have the viewers say so as well. The series adapted the first to the sixth volume of the light novel. ===Casting=== Atsushi Abe, Yuka Iguchi, Rina Satō, and Satomi Arai reprise their respective roles from the drama CD of the series, which was released in 2007, as Toma Kamijo, Index, Mikoto Misaka, and Kuroko Shirai.

Carlo Santos of Anime News Network graded the season 'C+', feeling that the "fight scenes, mind-bending story ideas, and unlikely plot twists" would delight fans but criticizing the "long- winded dialogue" and arrangement of story arcs that left "no sense of progression over the season". Nicoletta Christina Browne of THEM Anime Reviews was critical of the show's characters, describing Toma Kamijo a "boring and ineffective lead", the bond between him and Index "staler and shallower" than Toradora! characters Ryuji Takasu and Taiga Aisaka, and Mikoto Misaka a "poorly-written character", unlike her appearance in A Certain Scientific Railgun series. She rated the season 2 out of 5 stars, stating that it "isn't a total loss, but... was a bit of a tedious series". ===Accolade=== Abe won Best Rookie at the 4th Seiyu Awards for his role as Toma Kamijo. ==Note== ==References== ==External links== * Official website * * Category:2008 anime television series debuts Category:A Certain Magical Index Category:A Certain Magical Index episode lists Category:J.C.Staff Category:Television episodes about cloning
