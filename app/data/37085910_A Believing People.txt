A Believing People: Literature of the Latter-day Saints, edited by Richard H. Cracroft and Neal E. Lambert, and published in 1974, was "the first significant anthology of the literature of the Latter-day Saints" and began the establishment of the field of Mormon literature as a legitimate discipline, and remains, according to A Motley Vision in 2012, " the only comprehensive Mormon Literature anthology ever published." Cracroft and Lambert released an anthology with a more modern focus, 22 Young Mormon Writers, the following year.Three writers appear in both A Believing People and 22 Young Mormon Writers: Ann Doty, Clifton Holt Jolley, and Linda Sillitoe. ==Included authors== The collection includes works of many sorts (letters, poetry, sermons, etc.), mostly from LDS authors, but also some by those friendly to the Mormons (e.g. Thomas L. Kane) or with early-life connections (e.g. Ina Coolbrith) or similarly tangential relationships. Authors are listed alphabetically. Works without a listed author are not reflected in this list. === History === *Lucy Mack Smith *Joseph Smith Jr. *B. H. Roberts *Thomas L. Kane *Leonard J. Arrington *James E.
