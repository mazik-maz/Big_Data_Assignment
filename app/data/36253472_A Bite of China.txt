its nightly airing on CCTV-1, drawing an estimated 100 million viewers. It also has an overall approval rating of 91% on Douban. Oliver Thring of The Guardian praised it as "the best TV show I've ever seen about food. I'd hazard it's the best one ever made." == Controversy == In the Episode 2 of the Season 3, the voice-over indicates that Huifang as a community in Xi'an dates back to Tang dynasty. The remark was refuted by a history scholar, Yu Gengzhe. Yu commented on Weibo that where present-day Huifang located, was the Central Secretariat of Tang, along with the barracks of the imperial guards. And a mosque supposedly was sited there in the Song dynasty. Some of the portrayal of certain areas within the series have also been criticized. The background Chinese painting appeared in the documentary's poster is "Ridge cloud with rain" () by Xu Qinsong (). At first, the poster designer used the painting without permission of Mr. Xu, However, this copyright issue was later solved by reconciliation between the artist and the documentary producer. == International Broadcast == * -8TV (Malaysia) ==References== == External links == *English Official Site Category:Chinese cuisine Category:Chinese television shows Category:2012 Chinese television series debuts Category:Chinese documentary television series Category:China Central Television original programming
