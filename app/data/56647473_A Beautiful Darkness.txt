After she murders a Wayne Enterprises employee, a horrified Selina (Camren Bicondova) abandons her. Ivy then visits Bruce (David Mazouz) and, after hypnotizing him with a kiss, poisons him, causing him to hallucinate his closest friends and allies along with a mysterious cloaked figure, who reveals to Bruce that he is a manifestation of him formed by his grief and sorrow after his parents' deaths. Simultaneously, Ivy hypnotizes Fox (Chris Chalk) and forces him to take her to the laboratory where Project M is being conducted and she collects a sample of the Lazarus water that is being used in the experiments before escaping. Gordon (Ben McKenzie) tracks them down and rescues Fox before collecting the antidote and rescuing Bruce, who believes that he has seen his future. Ivy also uses the Lazarus water to create a new flower that can immediately kill someone upon contact with the petals. Meanwhile, Jerome (Cameron Monaghan) pesters Oswald (Robin Lord Taylor) in Arkham and he subjects him to numerous humiliating tasks in order to turn him insane and upon learning that Jerome is intending on escaping and wreaking havoc in Gotham, Oswald decides to use that to escape. ==Production== ===Development=== In March 2018, it was announced that the thirteenth episode of the season would be titled "A Beautiful Darkness" and was to be written by Tze Chun and directed by executive producer John Stephens. ===Casting=== Jessica Lucas and Drew Powell don't appear in the episode as their respective characters.
