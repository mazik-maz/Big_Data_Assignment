A Best 2 (stylized as 15px BEST 2) is a series of greatest hits albums by Japanese singer Ayumi Hamasaki, which were released simultaneously on by Avex Trax. The two-volume release is a direct successor to A Best (2001) and features material from a four-year period of her career. A Best 2 is split between contrasting "dark" and "light" themes, with the two volumes Black and White compiling songs of either nature, respectively. A Best 2 held the top two spots of the Oricon albums chart in its debuting week, with A Best 2: White at number one. This made Hamasaki the first female artist since Keiko Fuji to occupy both positions in 37 years. Both A Best 2 volumes were certified 3× Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of Japan. ==A Best 2: Black== A Best 2: Black includes a previously unreleased track, "Part of Me" (featured in a new Panasonic CM) and its accompanying music video. The song was certified gold for 100,000 legal downloads. ===Track listing=== ===DVD track listing=== 1st DVD – Promotional Videos # "Dearest" # "Carols" # "No Way to Say" # "Walking Proud" # "Free & Easy" # "Endless Sorrow" # "Because of You" # "About You" # "Game" # "Is This Love?" # "Hanabi: Episode II" # "Never Ever" [promotional clip] # "Heaven" # "Part of Me" # "H" [TV-CM] 2nd DVD – Best of CountDown Live 2006–2007 #Best of CountDown Live 2006–2007 (Behind the Scenes) (90 minutes) ===Charts=== Oricon Sales Chart (Japan) Release Chart Peak Position First Week Sales Sales Total Chart Run Oricon Daily Albums Chart 1 Oricon Weekly Albums Chart 2 470,057 970,000 52 Oricon Monthly Albums Chart 3 Oricon Yearly Albums Chart 7 * Total Sales : 970,000 (Japan) ==A Best 2: White== On January 15, 2007, A Best 2 was confirmed on Hamasaki's official website.

With the release of A Best 2, Hamasaki also broke many records. As of August 2007, A Best 2 has charted in the top 5 of 2007 Oricon Half-Yearly Album 2007 Chart. A Best: White charted as #3 and Black charted as #4; the nearest competitor was Kobukuro with "All Singles Best" with sales around 640,000 copies. However, factoring in consistent sales of Kobukuro's "All Singles Best", it is predicted that A Best 2 will fall down to #4 and #5, respectively. According to Avex, A Best 2 had sold over 2 million copies as of March 2007.
