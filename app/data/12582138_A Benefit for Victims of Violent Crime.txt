A Benefit for Victims of Violent Crime provided funds to The Center for Victims of Violence and Crime and features five new Anti-Flag studio tracks along with five live songs recorded at Pittsburgh's Mr. Smalls in April 2007. Bassist Chris #2's family experienced the horror of losing a family member when his sister and her boyfriend were both murdered, leaving behind a young daughter and son. Anti-Flagâ€™s reaction when faced with tragedy was to put together this limited edition benefit EP in hopes that it would help others who have gone through similar situations. == Track listing == ;Live Songs ==Personnel== *Justin Sane- Guitar & Lead Vocals *Chris Head- Guitar & Vocals *Chris #2- Bass & Lead Vocals *Pat Thetic- Drums == See also == * Victims' rights == References == Category:2007 EPs Category:Anti-Flag albums Category:A-F Records albums Category:Victims' rights
