A Bride for Henry is a 1937 American film directed by William Nigh based on the Josephine Bentham short story of the same name that was published in Liberty Magazine. Authors such as James Cox and Kylo-Patrick Hart have cited A Bride for Henry as within a subgenre of screwball comedies termed "sentimental comedy", where plots deal with domestic struggles but avoid true threats of adultery and ultimately defend marriage. The formation of the Production Code Administration (PCA) hastened the production of sentimental comedies; others include Maybe It's Love (1935), Three Married Men (1936), and Wife, Doctor, and Nurse (1937).Kylo-Patrick R. Hart, Film and Sexual Politics (Cambridge Scholars Press, 2006), 21; ==Plot== Sheila Curtis's (Anne Nagel) fianc√© Eric Reynolds (Henry Mollison) fails to appear for the wedding, so Sheila drafts her lawyer, Henry Tuttle (Warren Hull), to stand in for the missing groom.
