Writing for Variety, Courtney Howard called the film "gently disarming, heartening, holiday-themed escapism" and that it kept "genre-patented shenanigans and hijinks to a bare minimum, which is both a blessing and a curse." Writing for The Guardian, Jenny Colgan said there was "no jeopardy in this film at all: it is absolutely perfect for low-maintenance Christmas viewing" and that it was "lovely to see two great-looking actors who aren’t in the full flush of youth falling for one another." Gabriella Geisinger of Digital Spy said that the actors "manage to imbue their characters with a believable earnestness that belies the over cheese" and noted that the film was "mostly devoid of any socio-political landscape, which is a bit odd when a film is built on a system as controversial as aristocracy." The National said that the "main characters are obnoxious, the class politics are extremely dubious and the portrayal of rural village life incredibly patronising," but that "if you haven’t watched Cary Elwes try to catch fake snowflakes on his tongue, you haven’t lived." The imitations of Scottish accents and use of Scottish words and terms also met with mixed reactions. ==See also== * List of Christmas films ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2021 films Category:2021 romantic comedy films Category:2020s Christmas comedy films Category:2020s English-language films Category:American Christmas comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:Films about writers Category:Films directed by Mary Lambert Category:Films scored by Jeff Rona Category:Films set in castles Category:Films set in Scotland Category:Films shot in Edinburgh Category:2020s American films
