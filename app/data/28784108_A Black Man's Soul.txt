A Black Man's Soul is an instrumental album by musician Ike Turner & the Kings of Rhythm released by Pompeii Records in 1969. == Recording and release == A Black Man's Soul contains songs written by Ike Turner, fellow St. Louis musician Oliver Sain and some others including Rufus Thomas. The album was recorded during Turner's free time while he was touring with then wife Tina Turner as part of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. All tracks were recorded at various studios in the U.S. between tour dates. The album was released on the Dallas-based label Pompeii in April 1969. It was distributed by London Records in the Netherlands. A Black Man's Soul exposed a side of Turner's music not as popular with his audiences of the time. While Ike & Tina Turner's repertoire up to that point relied heavily on vocal harmonies and popular soul influences, these tracks reflected a more traditional and simple funk popularized by acts such as Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, Baby Huey, The Bar-Kays and Brother Jack McDuff among others. One single was released, "Thinking Black" / "Black Angel" (ST-100), distributed by Sterling Award Records in association with Pompeii Records. == Awards and nominations == A Black Man's Soul was nominated for Best R&B; Instrumental Performance at the 12th Annual Grammy Awards. == Reissues == A Black Man's Soul was released as Funky Mule (1975) by DJM Records in the UK and as Ike Turner & His Kings of Rhythm by Bellaphon Records in Germany. In 2003, the album was reissued on CD with four bonus tracks, including three with vocals from Tina Turner. It was digitally remastered and included in the 3-CD compilation The Complete Pompeii Recordings 1968-1969 released from Goldenlane Records in 2016. ==Sampling== *Los Angeles hip-hop group Jurassic 5 sampled "Getting Nasty" in the track "Concrete Schoolyard" on their self-titled EP. == Track listing == All tracks composed by Ike Turner; except where indicated. == Personnel == *Ike Turner - guitar, piano ;The Kings of Rhythm *Jesse Knight - guitar *Mack Johnson - drums *Tommy "Teasky" Tribble - percussion *Fred Sample, Billy Preston - piano *Washee - saxophone *Jesse Heron - trombone ;Technical *Loring Eutemey - cover design == References == ==External links== * Ike Turner & The Kings Of Rhythm â€“ A Black Man's Soul * A Black Man's Soul: The Ike Turner Diaries CD Category:1969 albums Category:Ike Turner albums Category:Instrumental albums Category:Albums produced by Ike Turner Category:Albums produced by Tina Turner Category:Funk albums by American artists Category:London Records albums
