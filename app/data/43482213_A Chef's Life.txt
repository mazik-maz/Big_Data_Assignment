Corey Lowenstein of The News & Observer wrote, "Howard and Hill's partnership works because both women intuitively understand the food landscape they are trying to portray." It won a Peabody Award in 2013 "for its refreshingly unsensational depiction of life and work in a modern restaurant—with generous sides of Southern folkways and food lore."73rd Annual Peabody Awards, May 2014. In 2018, A Chef's Life won the Daytime Emmy® for Outstanding Culinary Program.A Chef's Life Wins Daytime Emmy, April 2018. "The whole point of A Chef's Life is to showcase the people and traditions of Eastern North Carolina, not some version of them gussied up for TV." A 2018 Jezebel article titled "The Future of Food TV Is Female" parallels Samin Nosrat's Netflix show Salt Fat Acid Heat to Vivian Howard's PBS series A Chef's Life. Writer Megan Reynolds acknowledges the two shows' similarities by saying: "What differentiates Nosrat and Howard's shows from the men-hosted series is, of course, that they are women and are cleverly using their womanhood to subvert the expectations of what food television can and should be like. Traditionally, women on food TV are chained to a marble island in a large, well-appointed home, cooking a meal for their families in tightly-edited, half-hour bites. [...] Nosrat and Howard free themselves from the kitchen and go out into the world, just like the men would, but are kinder, more compassionate, and much more compelling." ==References== ==External links== * * A Chef's Life – official site Category:PBS original programming Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:2010s American cooking television series Category:Cuisine of the Southern United States Category:Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Culinary Program winners Category:Peabody Award-winning television programs Category:North Carolina culture
