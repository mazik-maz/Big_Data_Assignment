A Change of Seasons is a 1980 American comedy-drama film directed by Richard Lang. It stars Anthony Hopkins, Shirley MacLaine and Bo Derek. The film was a critical and commercial failure, grossing $7.2 million against its $6 million budget and receiving three nominations at the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Actor (Hopkins) and Worst Screenplay. ==Plot== When Karyn Evans discovers her arrogantly self-centered professor husband Adam is having an affair with student Lindsey Rutledge, she is out for Revenge. She retaliates by having a dalliance of her own with philosophical campus carpenter Pete Lachappelle. Adam is infuriated when he learns about his wife's new relationship, and she in turn defends her right to enjoy the same carnal pleasures he does. The four decide to share a Vermont ski house, where their efforts to behave like liberal people are tested by angst, hurt feelings, and Kasey Evans, who unexpectedly arrives to confront her parents with their outrageous behavior, who makes sure to put her parents back on the right track. ==Production notes== The film was shot on location in Glenwood Springs, Colorado and Williamstown, Massachusetts. Hopkins and MacLaine famously did not get along during the filming, and Hopkins said "she was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with." The theme song "Where Do You Catch the Bus for Tomorrow?" was written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman and Henry Mancini and performed by Kenny Rankin. Originally, Noel Black was hired to direct after producer Martin Ransohoff had seen his film, A Man, a Woman, and a Bank (1979). Black left the film during shooting due to creative differences. He was replaced by Richard Lang. Black shot the first half of the film only. Consenting Adults was the film's working title. ==Principal cast== *Shirley MacLaine .....

Man at Table ==Critical reception== In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby said the film "exhibits no sense of humor and no appreciation for the ridiculous ... the screenplay [is] often dreadful ... the only appealing performance is Miss MacLaine's, and she's too good to be true. A Change of Seasons does prove one thing, though. A farce about characters who've been freed of their conventional obligations quickly becomes aimless." Variety observed, "It would take the genius of an Ernst Lubitsch to do justice to the incredibly tangled relationships in A Change of Seasons, and director Richard Lang is no Lubitsch. The switching of couples seems arbitrary and mechanical, and more sour than amusing." TV Guide rates it one out of a possible four stars, adding the film "is as predictable as a long Arctic winter, and just about as interesting ... Marybeth Hurt ... steals what there is of the picture to steal." Time Out London calls it "kitsch without conviction, schlock without end ... glib trappings ... and witless dialogue sink everything except for the perky intelligence of MacLaine, who clearly deserves better than this."Time Out London review ==Awards and nominations== The film had the dubious distinction of garnering three nominations at the first Golden Raspberry Awards. * Nominated, Worst Actor (Anthony Hopkins) * Nominated, Worst Song (Where Do You Catch the Bus for Tomorrow? by Henry Mancini, Marilyn Bergman, Alan Bergman) * Nominated, Worst Screenplay (Erich Segal, Ronni Kern, and Fred Segal) ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:1980 films Category:1980 comedy-drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films scored by Henry Mancini Category:American comedy-drama films Category:Films directed by Richard Lang (director) Category:Midlife crisis films Category:1980s English-language films Category:1980s American films
