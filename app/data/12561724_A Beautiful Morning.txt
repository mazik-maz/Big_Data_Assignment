"A Beautiful Morning" is a song written by Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati and recorded by the Rascals. Coming out in early 1968, it was the group's first track released after shortening their name from the Young Rascals. The single was one of the earliest released in stereo, as 7-inch singles generally were in mono. Together with the Doors "Hello, I Love You", it's credited with changing the industry standard of singles. The song continued the theme of carefree optimism that had distinguished the previous year's "Groovin'". It was written one morning in Honolulu, Hawaii when the band was invited to perform there by promoter Tom Moffatt. It became a big hit in the United States, reaching number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and also reaching number 36 on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart. It was RIAA-certified as a Million Seller on June 28, 1968. The first album on which the song appeared was Time Peace: The Rascals' Greatest Hits. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1968) Peak position Australia KMR 36 Canada RPM Top SinglesImage : RPM Weekly - Library and Archives Canada 1 US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–2002 3 US Billboard R&B; 36 US Cash Box Top 100 3 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1968) Rank Canada 15 US Billboard Hot 100 35 US Cash Box 17 == Other versions == Renée Geyer covered the song on her album Dedicated (2007). == In other media == The song is featured in a Scrubs episode, at the start of a season 6 episode with Zach Braff, who plays J.D., dancing to it.
