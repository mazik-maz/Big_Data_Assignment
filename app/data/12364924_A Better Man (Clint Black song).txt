"A Better Man" is a song by American country music artist Clint Black. It was released in February 1989 as his debut single, and was served as the first single from his debut album, Killin' Time. It was written by Black and Hayden Nicholas. When "A Better Man" went to No. 1 on the Billboard magazine Hot Country Singles chart on June 10, Black was the first artist since Freddy Fender to ascend to the top of the country chart with his first charted single.Roland, Tom, "The Billboard Book of Number One Country Hits." (Billboard Books, Watson-Guptill Publications, New York, 1991 ()), p. 553-554 In addition, "A Better Man" was the No. 1 song of 1989 on the Hot Country Singles chart. The success of "A Better Man," along with the follow-up "Killin' Time," were instrumental in Black winning the Country Music Association's Horizon Award in 1989.Millard, Bob, "Country Music: 70 Years of America's Favorite Music" (HarperCollins, New York, 1993 ()), p. 161 ==Content== The song is a reflection on a relationship co-writer Black had recently ended with a girlfriend of seven years. He shared his dying romance story with friend Hayden Nicholas, who - after sharing an idea for the melody - came up with the hook line ("I'm leaving here a better man/For knowing you this way.").Roland. ==Music video== This was Clint Black's first music video; it was directed by Bill Young and premiered in early 1989. Much of the video is of Black driving down a little-used country road in a late-1950s Ford F-100 pickup truck, reflecting on his now-failed relationship. Interspersed are clips of Black performing the song before people dancing to the song. ==Chart positions== Chart (1989) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1989) Position Canada Country Tracks (RPM) 4 US Country Songs (Billboard) 1 ==Certifications== ==Sources== Category:1989 debut singles Category:1989 songs Category:Clint Black songs Category:Songs written by Clint Black Category:Songs written by Hayden Nicholas Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles of the year Category:Song recordings produced by James Stroud Category:Song recordings produced by Mark Wright (record producer) Category:RCA Records singles
