A Bedtime Story is a 1933 American pre-Code romantic comedy film starring Maurice Chevalier. ==Plot== Chevalier plays a Parisian playboy who finds himself obliged to care for an abandoned baby. The film was directed by Norman Taurog and also stars Edward Everett Horton, Helen Twelvetrees, and Baby LeRoy (in his film debut, as the baby). ==Production problem== The film was notable for the performance of Baby LeRoy, a one-year-old who had been selected from an orphanage by Chevalier and Taurog for his charming appeal. When certain scenes needed to be re-shot, they found that the baby had grown two front teeth, even though the later scenes would be showing the bare gums. There was no way round this.With Love, the Autobiography of Maurice Chevalier (Cassell, 1960), p. 325. ==Cast== *Maurice Chevalier as Monsieur Rene *Helen Twelvetrees as Sally *Edward Everett Horton as Victor Dubois *Adrienne Ames as Paulette *Baby LeRoy as Monsieur "Baby" *Earle Foxe as Max de l'Enclos *Leah Ray as Mademoiselle Gabrielle *Betty Lorraine as Suzanne Dubois *Gertrude Michael as Louise *Ernest Wood as Robert *Reginald Mason as General Louse's father *Henry Kolker as Agent de Police *George MacQuarrie as Henry Joudain *Paul Panzer as Concierge *Frank Reicher as Aristide *George Barbier as Toy Seller *Florence Roberts as Flower Shop Customer (uncredited) ==References== == External links == * * Category:1933 films Category:1933 musical comedy films Category:1933 romantic comedy films Category:American musical comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:American romantic musical films Category:Films directed by Norman Taurog Category:Films set in Paris Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1930s romantic musical films Category:1930s American films
