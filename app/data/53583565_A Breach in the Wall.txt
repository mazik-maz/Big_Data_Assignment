"A Breach in the Wall" is a 1967 TV play by Ray Lawler. It aired for British TV and screened in Australia as part of Wednesday Theatre. Australian TV drama was relatively rare at the time. It is about the remains of Thomas a'Beckett being discovered behind a church wall. ==Plot== In the near future, the parish church of the Kentish village of Valham is undergoing long-overdue restoration - restoration largely made possible by the fund-raising efforts of the able and radical young incumbent, Lewis Patterson. A walled-in chamber is discovered and within it is a coffin sealed with the crest of Becket. ==Cast== * Robert Harris as the Archhbishop * Barry Justice as Reverend Lewis Patterson * John Phillips as Cardinal Runan * Rosemary Leach as Katharine Elliott * Paul Hardwick as Canon Charles Humphrey * Jennifer Daniel as Sue Patterson * Kynaston Reeves as Dr. Matthews * John Bryans as Dr. Sadler * John Kidd as Dr. Aslam * Frances Alger as Eunice Street * Donald Morley as Brian Tracy * Hilda Braid as Mrs. Street * William Moore as Constable Howell * Barbara Graley as Miss Spain * Nicholas Brent as Eddie Street * John Tatham as Bourke ==Production== Lawler said "I don't pretend that this is necessarily how events would shape themselves if the situation arose. But I do believe that the historical significance of Thomas A'Beckct is contained in certain words from the play: 'A saint is somebody who spends his life on earth in bringing mankind nearer heaven, and his life hereafter bringing heaven nearer men'." ==References== ==External links== * Wednesday Theatre at IMDb * A Breach in the Wall at AustLit Category:1968 television plays Category:1968 Australian television episodes Category:1960s Australian television plays Category:Wednesday Theatre (season 4) episodes
