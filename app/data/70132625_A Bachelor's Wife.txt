Mary takes the baby to the Stuyvesant mansion, demanding that it be recognized. Mrs. Stuyvesant, an invalid, is delighted with the child, and mistaking Mary for her daughter-in-law, invites her to stay and take charge of the house. The doctor informs Mary that she must comply with the old lady's request, as a shock might prove fatal to her. John Stuyvesant arrives home and denounces Mary as an imposter. She admits that she is but insists that he shall do right by Norah. He insists he was never married, and to prove it starts to marry another girl. Mary confronts him with the marriage license, which it appears belongs to J. Frederick Stuyvesant, a cousin. He had failed to acknowledge Norah as his wife while waiting to come into his fortune. Things straighten themselves out, Norah and the child come into their own and Mary and John decide to marry. ==Cast== * Mary Miles Minter as Mary O’Rourke * Allan Forrest as John Stuyvesant * Myrtle Reeves as Norah Cavanagh * Lydia Knott as Mrs Stuyvesant * Charles Spere as Fred Stuyvesant * Margaret Shelby as Genevieve Harbison * Harry Holden as Dr Burt ==References== ==External links== * Category:1919 films Category:1919 drama films Category:Silent American drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Lost American films Category:1919 lost films Category:Lost drama films Category:Films with screenplays by Joseph F.
