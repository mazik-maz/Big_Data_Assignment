The movie had the largest budget ever given to Buchanan. Buchanan later said his "cue" on the film was Woody Guthrie's 'The Ballad of Pretty Boy Floyd,' which examines the populist folk- hero angle of the outlaw. In particular, he was inspired by Woody's great line about how 'some men will rob you with a six-gun, and some will rob you with a fountain pen'." The film features Morgan Fairchild in a small role as a gangster's moll. Buchanan later said "I gave her her first job" on the film. According to one account, halfway through the film AIP executives were worried about the movie being behind schedule and replaced Buchanan with Maury Dexter.Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 p241 According to Dexter's own memoirs, he went on the film as executive producer at the behest of James H. Nicholson of AIP "to make sure Larry brought the film in on schedule and with some amount of quality." Dexter says that "the film went along without a hitch and Larry delivered a nice film" but that after it was put together to a rough cut Dexter and AIP "thought it was too slow and talky." He then took a small crew and returned to Dallas with stunt doubles and the actors "and shot several scenes involving action. We cut the new material in and we thought it helped the film overall."Maury Dexter, Highway to Hollywood p 134 accessed 5 July 2014 ===Songs=== The group The Source sing the following songs: *"Bullet for a Pretty Boy" *"It's Me I'm Running From" *"I'm Gonna Love You ('Til I Die)" *"Gone Tomorrow" *"Ruby Ruby" ==Reception== The New York Times accused Buchanan of making "a murderous gangster movie full of mostly nice guys" which "looks a little as if they had taken the members of the cast of, say, Beach Blanket Bingo and put them in costume and given them old cars to drive and told them to play it for real." The Los Angeles Times thought the film was "surprisingly free from gratuitous gore" but was still "another very pale carbon of Bonnie and Clyde" in which Fabian "handles himself in competent fashion amidst a host of amateurs." Diabolique magazine later said: > Fabian gives another accomplished performance as a gee-it-isn’t-his-fault- > kid-forced-to-crime.
