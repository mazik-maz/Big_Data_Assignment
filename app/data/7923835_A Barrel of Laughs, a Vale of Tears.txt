The book expresses the emotions of various individuals through two long-lost lovers reunited, several unlikely couples marrying, and a friend-turned-evil's attempts for revenge. While Roger himself starts out as pure and innocent, he seems somewhat naive and incapable of feeling serious. The quest, which contains plenty of sad events, gradually brings Roger to a point where he still is humorous, but is caring about specific individuals as opposed to finding shallow humor in everything. The beautiful Princess Petulia, and her servant, likewise, find similar changes in personality through their experiences, as they go from being bitterly indifferent to loving and plainspoken to kinder respectively. ==Publication history== * * * * * * * (German language) ==References== Category:American children's novels Category:1995 American novels Category:1995 fantasy novels Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:HarperCollins books Category:Works by Jules Feiffer Category:1995 children's books Category:Children's books about princes Category:Novels about royalty
