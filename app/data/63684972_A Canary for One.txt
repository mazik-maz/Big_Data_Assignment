The middle-aged woman seems to be partly deaf and anxious about the fast-moving train crashing. She is delighted by a canary she bought in Palermo in Sicily. The train passes a house fire and wrecked vehicles. Halfway through the story, the narrator reveals himself to be the husband, listening in on the womanâ€™s conversation with his wife. After finding out that the couple are American, the woman mentions repeatedly that Americans make the only good husbands. She bought the canary for her still-heartbroken daughter, whom she prevented from marrying a Swiss man in Vevey two years ago. As they exit the train, it is revealed that the American couple will live separately in Paris. ==Development== Hemingway began writing the first drafts of "A Canary for One" in September 1926. ==References== ==External links== * * Full text of "A Canary for One" at HathiTrust Digital Library Category:1927 short stories Category:Short stories by Ernest Hemingway Category:Works originally published in Scribner's Magazine Category:Short stories set on trains Category:Short stories set in France
