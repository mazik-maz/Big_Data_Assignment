A [For 100 Cars] is a minimalist composition by Ryoji Ikeda. It was written in 2017 and performed on 15 October as part of a Red Bull Music Academy festival held in Los Angeles. The piece is written for an "orchestra" of 100 cars, which produce sound using sine wave synthesisers. Each synthesiser is tuned to a different pitch that has been associated with the note A throughout history. The synthesisers were created by Tatsuya Takahashi and Masimillian Rest. == Composition == Ryoji Ikeda is a Japanese audiovisual artist and composer. He composed A [For 100 Cars] for part of a Red Bull Music Academy (RBMA) festival held in Los Angeles. The idea behind A [For 100 Cars] springs from Ikeda's curiosity with the various frequencies associated to the note A. Throughout history, A been associated with many different frequencies, before being standardised to 440 Hz in 1975 by the International Organization for Standardization. The use of cars in the composition was conceptualised six months prior to its performance, during a conversation between Ikeda and the co-founder of the RBMA, Torsten Schmidt. While talking about cars, they considered making an "automobile orchestra". They decided to use synthesisers to create the sounds emitted by the cars. The synthesisers used for the performance at the festival were designed by Tatsuya Takahashi, the synthesiser designer who formerly worked as chief engineer at Korg. The project was the first design Takahashi had made since leaving Korg. Takahashi partnered with Masimillian Rest of E-RM, a Berlin-based musical instrument maker, to create the synthesisers over a period of around three months. Ikeda views the composition as a collaboration between himself and the car drivers. When asked by LA Weekly, he was reluctant to take credit for the piece, saying: == Music == thumb|A [For 100 Cars] is scored for a group of 100 cars. A [For 100 Cars] is performed by a group of 100 cars. This arrangement was called "the world's largest synth orchestra" by Mixmag and Vice. A full performance of the piece lasts for around 27–28 minutes. Each car has a synthesiser connected to its sound system which constantly outputs a sine wave drone at a frequency that has been associated with the note A at some point in history, from 1361 to 1936. The frequencies range from 376.3 – 506.9 Hz. Some frequencies chosen by Ikeda include: * 376.3 Hz – A used by the organ of l'Hospice Comtesse (dated ) in Lille * 419.6 Hz – A used by the organ of Seville Cathedral * 422.7 Hz – A used by the tuning fork of John Broadwood and Sons, London (17th century) * 427 Hz – A used by the Paris Grand Opera (1811) * 430 Hz – A used by the tuning fork of Henry Lemoine (1810) * 457.2 Hz – A used by the tuning fork of Steinway and Sons (1879) == Performance == thumb|The premiere of A [For 100 Cars] took place opposite the Walt Disney Concert Hall.As the piece is loud (reaching almost 160dB), a safety test was completed in Cologne before the performance in Los Angeles. To make sure that it was a safe experience for the driver, Ikeda personally took part in the test. In the performance, all drivers were given a pair of headphones. The performance of A [For 100 Cars] took place on 15 October 2017 at a multi- storey car park at 131 South Olive Street, Los Angeles. This location is opposite the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The 100 cars used for the performance were lined up in rows on top of the car park. The performance began at dusk at 6:17pm in front of an audience of around 1000 people. At the start of the performance, the drivers started their engines and created a grumbling sound by revving them: a sound some likened to an orchestra tuning. The performers were from Los Angeles and were chosen by Ikeda for their car's modified stereos; no performer was a professional musician. The car's designs were varied and included sedans, SUVs and Los Angeles' signature lowriders. Each performer was given a score to read which dictated when to play the synthesiser, as well as the volume and octave (from A1 to A8). To better emit the sounds created by Takahashi's synthesisers, some drivers opted to open their car's doors. The performers included some notable residents of the area such as the photographer Estevan Oriol, who was driving his Chevrolet Impala SS. == Reception == A [For 100 Cars] received a mixed reception from reporters and audiences. It was widely seen as unusual: Selim Bulut of Dazed commented that the sound produced was an "unusual but calming ambient tone". Writing in Vice, Emily Manning agreed, saying that "the A notes sounded a bit like what you might expect to hear when UFOs land, but more peaceful, almost like a field of humming June bugs". In the Los Angeles Times, Randall Roberts wrote that the performance "felt like a feat not only of bringing imagination to life, but of organization and community". Jon Caramanica wrote in The New York Times that A [For 100 Cars] "turned negative space in the center of downtown Los Angeles into a sublime womb [and] felt like a meditation". Mixmag put the performance on their list of the best performances from the festival, and praised the "depth of thinking and originality behind the piece [which] made it a breathtaking experience for those in attendance". Other listeners were not as impressed. In Autoweek, Mark Vaughn wrote that "most of it sounded, frankly, kind of bland" but conceded that "it was kind of cool to experience". == References == === Sources === * == External links == * YouTube video explaining the project Category:2017 compositions Category:Minimalistic compositions Category:Music of Los Angeles
