His only daughter Anitha (Monica) returns home from Chennai after completing a course in fashion designing. Having lost her mother at a very young age, Anitha is close to her father, and they share a special bond. Soon, Anitha's marriage is fixed with Elango (Aravind Akash), the son of Vedachalam (Cochin Haneefa). While Vedachalam is a good-for-nothing chap, Elango is a perfect match. Elango falls in love with Anitha, but she tells him of her past: her lover Akash (Navdeep), who had jilted her after a one-night stand. Elango, though shattered, meets Akash and tries to unite him with Anitha. In this attempt, he finds himself falling in love with Anitha's cousin Eeswari (Saranya Mohan).
