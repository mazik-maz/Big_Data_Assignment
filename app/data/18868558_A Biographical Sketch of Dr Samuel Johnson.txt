A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson was written by Thomas Tyers for The Gentleman's Magazine's December 1784 issue. The work was written immediately after the death of Samuel Johnson and is the first postmortem biographical work on the author. The first full length biography was written by John Hawkins and titled Life of Samuel Johnson. ==Background== There is little known about the relationship that Johnson and Tyers shared, except that Johnson claimed that "Tyers always tells him something he did not know before"Hill 1897 p. 362 and was familiarly mentioned by Johnson to Johnson's friends.Boswell 1887 p. 308 However, Johnson, in The Idler, described Tyers, called Tom Restless, as "a circumstance" and says: > "When Tom Restless rises he goes into a coffee-house, where he creeps so > near to men whom he takes to be reasoners, as to hear their discourses and > endeavours to remember something which, when it has been strained through > Tom's head, is so near to nothing, that what it once was cannot be > discovered. This he carries round from friend to friend through a circle of > visits, till, hearing what each says upon the question, he becomes able at > dinner to say a little himself; and as every great genius relaxes himself > among his inferiors, meets with some who wonder how so young a man can talk > so wisely."Hill 1897 p. 380 On 13 December 1784, Samuel Johnson died.Bate 1977 p. 600 In response to his death,Bate 1955 p. 147 the Gentleman's Magazine ran A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson for their December issue.Hill 1897 p. 335 The work was written in the short time between the death and the printing.Hill 1897 p. 366 Although it was the first biographical work on Johnson, the first full-length biography would be published by Murphy in 1787.Davis 1961 p. vii ==Biography== Tyers used his Biographical Sketch to discuss Johnson's mental state, but not everyone agreed with the way Tyers revealed Johnson's private life; Hester Thrale wrote, in her Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, "Poor Johnson! I see they will leave nothing untold that I laboured so long to keep secret; & I was so very delicate in trying to conceal his fancied Insanity."Thrale 1897 p. 199 Regardless of what Thrale may have wanted, critics focused on Johnson's mental state from then after. In particular, John Wain emphasizes Tyers's description of Johnson as "like a ghost. He never speaks unless he is spoken to",Wain 1974 p. 246 which Wain considered a "bon mot".Wain 1974 p. 345 Likwise, Walter Jackson Bate relies on how Tyers was able to partly capture Johnson's "bisociative" ability to bring "together two different frames of experience".Bate 1977 p. 497 Tyers, when saying Johnson "said the most common things in the newest manner", describes Johnson's "unpredictability" and a > "further process of mind in which the original shuffling of perspectives, > already surprising us with elements we had overlooked or forgotten, is > joined by considerations drawn from other matrices of experience that can > only be described as 'moral,' that is, having to do with the condition of > man - with human hopes and fears; with values, purpose or aim; with the > shared sense, never forgotten, of the 'doom of man'; and with an unsleeping > practical urgency in considering concretely what to do and how to live." Tyers concludes his work by saying: > "At the end of this sketch, it may be hinted (sooner might have been > prepossession) that Johnson told this writer, for he saw he always had his > eye and ear upon him, that at some time or other he might be called upon to > assist a posthumous account of him. A hint was given to our author, a few > years ago, by this Rhapsodist, to write his own life, lest somebody should > write it for him. He has reason to believe, he has left a manuscript > biography behind him. His executors, all honourable men, will sit in > judgment upon his papers. Thuanus, Buchanan, Huetius, and others, have been > their own historians. The memory of some people, says Mably very lately, 'is > their understanding.' This may be thought, by some readers, to be the case > in point. Whatever anecdotes were furnished by memory, this pen did not > choose to part with to any compiler. His little bit of gold he has worked > into as much gold-leaf as he couldTyers 1897 pp. 379-380 ==Critical response== James Boswell, in his Life of Samuel Johnson, wrote: > "[Tyers] abounded in anecdote, but was no sufficiently attentive to > accuracy. I therefore cannot venture to avail myself much of a biographical > sketch of Johnson which he published, being one among the various persons > ambitious of appending their names to that of my illustrious friend. That > sketch is, however, an entertaining little collection of fragments." ==Notes== ==References== * . * . * Boswell, James. Life of Johnson Vol. 3, London: 1887. * Davis, Bertram.
