The family had been in the rug trade in Turkey since 1818, and they began in the United States in 1897 as rug importers, and then expanded into manufacturing in 1903. By 1927 they had 15 broadlooms, weighing 15 tons each, and 196 single looms. They developed, and were the only manufacturers of "Gulistan Rug" carpets. They made the carpet for Radio City Music Hall in 1932 and for the United States Supreme Court building in 1933. They stopped manufacturing oriental carpets in 1953. ==Miran Karagheusian== Miran Karagheusian (1874–1948) married Zabelle and had: Howard Karagheusian who died young, and a scholarship was set up in his name; and a daughter, Leila Karagheusian (c1910-1999). Miran Karagheusian died on October 7, 1948, at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, he lived in Oyster Bay, New York and he had attended Robert College in Turkey. ==Arshag Karagheusian== Arshag Karagheusian (1872–1963) had the following children: Jean Karagheusian Hallaure (1898–2000) aka Alice Hallaure; Charles Karagheusian (1903–1977) who married Artemis Tavshanjian (1904–1990) on April 30, 1927, and Marguerite Karagheusian Agathon (husband Oshin Agathon) (1904–1986).

Arshag died on September 24, 1963, in Larchmont, New York. ==Renovation== In 2001, the mill reopened as a 202-unit affordable apartment complex, named The Continental at Freehold. The New Jersey Department of Community Affairs (DCA) and its affiliated New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency (HMFA) were major financiers of the project. Community Affairs Commissioner Jane M. Kenny said: "Nearly forty years after the looms were packed up and hauled away, the rug mill is a working building once again." ==Archive== The Monmouth County Historical Association at 70 Court Street in Freehold Borough, New Jersey, houses a collection of manuscripts, newsletters, newspaper clippings, photographs, negatives and other materials related to the A & M Karagheusian Rug Mill, which was located in Freehold, New Jersey. ==Roselle Park factory== The company had a factory in Roselle Park, New Jersey, from May 19, 1923 to 1962. ==References== ==External links== *Monmouth County Historical Association: Coll. 51 A & M Karagheusian, Inc.

28380942	A & P Food Stores Building	The A & P Food Stores Building in St. Louis, Missouri, is historically significant in part because it is rare in Saint Louis as a small commercial building having an Art Deco building design. Most others were either residential or larger commercial buildings. It also serves as an example of the work of Saum Architects, a not-well-known architectural firm of Saint Louis in the early 1900s. And it is also significant as having been one of the first supermarkets in St. Louis that was developed to serve automobile-owning customers, providing parking and convenient "one-stop shopping". including photos There were as many as 84 A & P stores in the city, 20 being supermarkets and the others being cash and carry stores; this building is one of the last surviving of these, and it was among those which kept operating up until A & P entirely left the city in 1979–1980. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. ==See also== * The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company, food store chain ==References== Category:Art Deco architecture in Missouri Category:Buildings and structures in St. Louis Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1940 Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Missouri Category:The Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company Category:National Register of Historic Places in St. Louis Category:Grocery store buildings

According to David Simons, author, the original studio at 112 West 48th St., which was started on a shoestring budget, remains Ramone's greatest legacy. The studio was designed for the purpose of doing demos. According to Ramone, the room, by , had an incredibly unique sound.

Director Tatsuya Mori was allowed exclusive access to Aum's offices for over a year as news media were continually kept out. However, despite the documentary's unique perspective on Aum's internal workings, it was not financially successful.

However, the CBFC permits only 20 random minutes to be screened, and the climax is censored to such an extent that it no longer made any sense. She suggests its producers to re-shoot the film. However, Soorya is not able to participate in the film's shoot as he became a drunkard after actress Chandini, who debuted with his film, rejected his love. Soorya's family is unable to meet their ends after he stops directing films. Lost in her thoughts, he wanders near her house every night drunk, only to be expelled by her henchmen. Unable to bear Soorya's torture, Chandini asks him to jump from a building to prove his love. Soorya jumps without hesitation. While he survived the fall, he is badly wounded and admitted to the hospital by Marina and the team. One of Soorya's former assistant directors explains Soorya's past to Marina. Soorya was a successful director who had no feelings, especially for a woman's love. After his current female lead fails to act properly, he cast Chandini after a chain of events. Initially, Soorya rejects Chandini's love, but after frequent run-ins and days of pursuit, Soorya falls in love with her madly. Soorya later meets a rich and busy Chandini, who lives in a big bungalow and as the mistress of a wealthy married businessman. Chandini defends herself, saying that Soorya's views on the materialistic world influenced her to prioritize money over everything else after her father's death. He tries to explain to her that she is wrong, but is expelled. Due to this, Soorya gave up everything and became an alcoholic, wandering near her house every day, hoping that she would accept him. Soorya escapes from the hospital and is confronted by Marina, to whom Soorya explains his love for Chandini. He then saves a novice actress named Archana from a group of henchmen who are revealed to be Chandini. Archana reveals Chandini was used as bait by the politicians to trap Soorya and stop his A from release. In turn, Chandini exploited the weakness of those politicians by way of the casting couch. She proves this to Soorya, who, along with his father and Archana, are arrested on charges of prostitution. The police were bribed by Chandini, who abducts Archana while Soorya and his father are arrested. Soorya and his father are released on bail by Marina, and his family's plight makes Soorya swear revenge. He restarts the shoot of A and turns out to be a superstar due to the films' success starring him. The climax shoot is pending, and Soorya wants to shoot it realistically, which is the death of Chandini in a burning house. The camera rolls and Soorya kidnaps Chandini from her hen house where women are prostituted to influential politicians and people in business, where she kills the businessman she was engaged to. He brings her to the location and sets it on fire after rolling the camera. She knocks him out, who falls unconscious after hitting a rock. Archana, Marina, and the producers come to the spot to save him. Archana shows him the film footage that was shot after revealing that Chandini is a good woman who wanted to bring Soorya back to normal by acting as a ruthless criminal who is destroying many actresses' lives like Archana. The footage shows a naked Chandini dying and revealing the truth. Chandini says that the businessman was a friend of few corrupt politicians who wanted to have sex with her. They killed her father and sexually assaulted her and her minor sister. The businessman blackmails Chandini with a tape that captured the brutal assault. As per their directions, she had to cheat Soorya. However, Chandini brings Soorya back to normal with the help of Archana and gives A a perfect ending. Soorya tries to save her by entering the house, but she dies, asking him to live long and make films that expose the demons that haunt society. ==Cast== ==Production== Upendra and three others B. G.

It is her twelfth studio album overall. A is Fältskog's first album since 2004's My Colouring Book, an album of cover versions of her favourite songs from the 1960s, and the first original material she had recorded since I Stand Alone in 1987. It also includes her first self-penned track in nearly 30 years, "I Keep Them on the Floor Beside My Bed" . ==Album information== As Fältskog was not an active recording artist at the time, the album happened in a roundabout way. "The project came about through a good friend of mine", she explained. "She called me up and told me that Jörgen Elofsson and Peter Nordahl wanted to play me some music. They came to my house and played me three songs and I thought, 'Oh my God, I have to do this'. It felt like a challenge." Ten tracks were recorded for the album at Atlantis Studio (sv), Stockholm, all of which were written or co-written by Elofsson. Speaking with author Paul Stenning, Elofsson explained, "Agnetha is not just any artist, she is an icon with a rich heritage. We really felt the pressure of making something great, we didn't want to destroy anything for ABBA or Agnetha given the reputation they've built over the years. I'm really happy to say I think we pulled it off!" ===Song information=== The lead single from the album was "When You Really Loved Someone", which was released worldwide on 11 March 2013 as a digital download, with a CD single following on 15 April. A video clip for the song was filmed in late 2012, with Max Fowler and Camilla Rowling co-starring with Fältskog. In Germany and Austria the lead single was "The One Who Loves You Now", also released on 11 March 2013. The track "I Should've Followed You Home" is a duet recorded with Gary Barlow of the British group Take That. Both artists recorded their vocal parts separately, as Fältskog was on holiday at the time of Barlow's recording session. Nevertheless, Fältskog stated, "I think our voices work so well together." The song had its radio premiere on 21 April on a Dutch radio station.Home | Schiffers.fm | AVRO "I Was a Flower" is a string-attached piano ballad, produced and performed in a theatrical way. On 22 April, the song was made available for download only through Amazon. "I Keep Them on the Floor Beside My Bed" is the first track Fältskog has written herself that has been released since "I Won't Let You Go"—the lead single from her 1985 album Eyes of a Woman—and its B-side "You're There". Fältskog commented, "Jorgen kept saying 'You have to write a song for this record'. I hadn't written any music for a long, long time. But I sat at the piano and suddenly it was there. A friend of mine said a lovely thing: 'It's in your spine. Even if you feel tired, when it's time, it will be there'." Other tracks on the album include the contemplative "Bubble", the disco "Dance Your Pain Away", the pop "Back on Your Radio", and the piano-led "Past Forever". ==Promotion== ===Personal appearances=== Fältskog appeared on stage at G-A-Y in London on 4 May 2013 to promote the album. Although she did not perform, 10 fans had the chance to meet her backstage after the appearance. On 1 August 2013 she appeared on stage at Stockholm Gay Pride, where she was presented with her Gold record award for sales of the album in Sweden. In the same week of the announcement of her album release, Fältskog was a guest on the Norwegian-Swedish television talk show Skavlan. The show was filmed on 14 March 2013 and aired the next day.Skavlan.com - The SKAVLAN Talk show The Seven Network in Australia aired a special edition of the programme Sunday Night at 6:30pm on 5 May 2013 focusing on Fältskog and including new interview material shot in Sweden in late April. A television commercial for the album was shown as well. Due to popular demand, the programme showed other unaired portions of the interview on 12 May 2013. Fältskog filmed a documentary for the BBC in mid-April, titled Agnetha: Abba and After, which aired in the UK on 11 June.Agnetha has been filming an exclusive documentary for the BBC. - Agnetha FĂ¤ltskog | Agnetha FĂ¤ltskog Afterwards the album returned to the UK Top 40, w/e June 16, 2013, to its peak position of 6, and to a new high of number 9 on the UK Album Download Chart.

In the UK and Ireland The Big Issue featured Fältskog on the cover of their June edition along with an interview about her life. ===Internet and social media=== In order to promote the album and its singles, several social media web profiles for Fältskog were created, including pages on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. ==Reception== BBC News called A a "tasteful and sumptuous" mid-tempo album; the disco song "Dance Your Pain Away" was noted as the only exception to the general tempo, its bassline reminiscent of ABBA's "Voulez-Vous". In a review of the album, The Times gave the album four out of five stars, calling A "a triumphant return to form by a woman presumed lost to music forever". Helen Brown awarded the album three out of five stars in a review in The Daily Telegraph, dubbing the album "as beautifully boring as ever".Helen Brown: Agnetha Fältskog, A, album review .

3427439	A (Ayumi Hamasaki EP)	A (stylized as 15px) is an extended play (EP) by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released by Avex Trax in Japan and Hong Kong on August 11, 1999, in 10 different editions, and through Avex Entertainment Inc. worldwide in September 2008. It additionally served as a single from her second studio album Loveppears (1999), and is her first single marketed as an EP. The 12-track EP contains four new original songs: "Monochrome", "Too Late", "Trauma", and "End Roll", and eight remixes. All songs were written by Hamasaki, while production was handled by long-time collaborator Max Matsuura. Musically, like Loveppears, A is a pop rock album with dance music influences. Lyrically, the new songs are written from a third-person perspective, and deal with themes such as nostalgia, anxiety, and trauma. Upon release, A received favorable reviews from music critics for its individual tracks—some of which were highlighted as examples of Hamasaki's best work—and as a collection, with additional praise for the production quality of the EP versions of the original songs over that of their parent album counterparts. Some criticism was directed towards the number of remixes present on the EP. Commercially, the single peaked at number one in Japan, on the Oricon Singles Chart and TBS' Count Down TV chart. It became Hamasaki's second consecutive single to sell over one million copies domestically—it is also the singer's highest-selling single—and was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. Hamasaki did not film any music videos for the new songs, but appeared in several commercials broadcast in Japan that featured the new music. Each original song has subsequently been included on various greatest hits albums released by Hamasaki, including A Best (2001) and A Complete: All Singles (2008). ==Content and composition== A was Hamasaki's first extended play release, and was her first EP to be marketed as a single in Japan. The EP consists of four recordings: "Monochrome", "Too Late", "Trauma", and "End Roll", all written by Hamasaki herself and produced by Japanese musician and her long-time collaborator Max Matsuura. The three songs apart from "Monochrome" were composed by Japanese musician Dai Nagao, who used the alias D.A.I., whilst the latter track was composed by Japanese band HΛL. The tracks were arranged by Naoto Suzuki and Nagao, and eventually mixed by American engineer Dave Ford; the edited versions that appeared on Hamasaki's second studio album Loveppears (1999) were re-vised and mixed by Dave Way. Naoto played the keyboards and synthesizers in all four original tracks, whilst Jun Kajiwara, Naoki Hayashibe, both Hidetoshi Suzuki and Naoki Hayashibe, and Hayashibe played the electric guitar in "Trauma", "End Roll", "Too Late", and "Monochrome" respectively. Musically, A was described by staff members at AllMusic as a pop rock release. However, like a majority of the sounds throughout the parent album, the original tracks are also inspired by dance music. A staff member from Japanese magazine CD Journal commented that both "Trauma" and "Too Late" were dance tunes, whilst "Monochrome" was set at a medium tempo. Lyrically, the song was written in third person perspective, a trait that is shared with the rest of the album's tracks. The review at CD Journal noted that each track included different emotions and themes; Hamasaki talked about her anxiety in "Too Late", nostalgia in "Monochrome", and "transforming" trauma into positivity in "Trauma". ==Release== A was released by Avex Trax in Japan and Hong Kong on August 11, 1999, in 10 different editions, and through Avex Entertainment Inc. worldwide in September 2008. The EP included the four original recordings, plus four remixes, two bonus remix tracks through first press issues of the single, and an instrumental version for the original songs. To market each original track in Japan, Avex distributed four different editions of the single by changing the compact disc colors, these being blue, green, orange, and red.Each of the single's limited edition releases are noted below on the liner notes; * * * * For each color, the original recordings included on the track list is shifted down one and each variation were limited to 70,000 units. After the single sold over one million units in Japan, Avex Trax distributed a limited gold edition disc that was noted by the company through the liner notes as just a sticker. This edition was limited to 100,000 copies in Japan. However, after the first gold version sold over its limit, Avex published a second gold disc titled the Shining Gold CD to 150,000 copies in Japan. The disc was made of real gold, and the artwork of Hamasaki was tinted gold. Two promotional 12" vinyls were distributed in Japan by Rhythm Republic on October 16, 1999; the first vinyl featured a remix for both "Too Late" and "Monochrome", whilst the second vinyl included a remix for each original recording. The artwork was photographed by Toru Kumazawa, and features Hamasaki in a black dress in front of a black backdrop, holding onto a long piece of white string. The logo on the artwork was the first establishment of Hamasaki's logo/emblem, a staple she has used ever since. Although the original recordings were promoted together with the EP, each of them were distributed in Japan and worldwide as individual singles. "Monochrome" was remixed by American DJ Keith Litman, and released in North America in early 2001, whilst English electronic music group The Orb remixed the track and released it in the United Kingdom by Badorb.com on July 21, 2001; the latter release was limited to 486 vinyls. American duo Thunderpuss remixed the track "Trauma" and released it in North America through the offices of Avex USA in early 2001. "Too Late" was remixed by Soul Solution and was released in North America through Avex USA in mid-2001. ==Critical response== Upon its release, A received favorable reviews from music critics. In a review for Loveppears at CD Journal, a staff member selected "Trauma", "Too Late", "Monochrome", and another album track titled "And Then" as the best songs. In general, the review commended Hamasaki's songwriting and her vocal delivery. However, a separate review for the A at the same publication was mixed. The review complimented the original four recordings, but criticized the amount of remixes and felt the extra editions were not "convincing" for Hamasaki's fan base. In retrospect, AllMusic's Alexey Eremenko, whom contributed to writing Hamasaki's biography on the website, selected "End Roll", "Monochrome", and "Trauma" as an examples of her best work. In 2015, Japanese website Goo.ne.jp hosted a 24-hour only poll for audiences in Japan to vote for their favorite single released by Hamasaki. As a result, A ranked at number 12, with a rating of 32.1 average percent. ==Commercial performance== Commercially, the single was a success in Japan. It debuted at number one on the Oricon Singles Chart, selling 508,940 units in its first week of sales. A is the 78th single with the highest first week sales, a record that still holds as of July 2016. It stayed at number one of three non-consecutive weeks, and lasted 18 weeks on the top 200, one of Hamasaki's longest spanning singles on that chart. Likewise, it debuted at number one on the Count Down TV chart hosted by Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS). It stayed atop of the charts for two weeks, and lasted 17 weeks in the top 100. By the end of 1999, it had sold over 1,630,540 units in Japan and ranked at number three on Oricon's Annual 1999 chart. It resulted as the highest selling EP–single by any artist at the time, and was the highest selling single by a female artist. Similarly, it ranked at number six on TBS' Annual Chart, the third highest selling single by a female artist (behind two entries by Japanese recording artist Hikaru Utada), alongside being the highest selling EP–single. In July 2000, the single was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units; this was her second consecutive single to sell over one million units, the first being the previous single from Loveppears "Boys & Girls". As of July 2016, it is Hamasaki's highest selling physical single of her entire career on Oricon Style's data base, and is the 57th best selling single in Japan of all time; it is the ninth highest selling single by a female artist. ==Promotion and live performances== No music videos were shot for the tracks on A, her first major release to not feature any visuals. However, in Japan, Hamasaki appeared in commercial endorsement videos that promoted each original track from A. "Trauma" and "Monochrome" were used as the official theme songs for two commercials of JT Peach Water drinks, whilst "Too Late" was the theme song for Honda Giorno Crea, and Hal's remix of "End Roll" was featured in commercial for Morinaga. The videos for each commercial appeared on several DVD compilations released by Hamasaki: A Clips (2000), a self-titled DVD, A Complete Box Set (2004), and the digital release of A Clips Complete (2014). "Trauma" and "End Roll" were included on her greatest hits compilation album A Best (2001), whilst "Monochrome" was added onto A Complete: All Singles (2008), To promote the EP, each original recording were performed on Hamasaki's first part and second part of her 2000 concert tour in Japan. ==Track listing== *Original CD single # "Monochrome" – 4:29 # "Too Late" – 4:20 # "Trauma" – 4:18 # "End Roll" – 4:49 # "Monochrome" (Keith Litman's Big City Vocal Mix) – 9:35 # "Too Late" (Razor 'N Guido Remix) – 8:12 # "Trauma" (Heavy Shuffle Mix) – 6:10 # "End Roll" (Hal's Mix) – 4:16 # "Monochrome" (Instrumental) – 4:29 # "Too Late" (Instrumental) – 4:20 # "Trauma" (Instrumental) – 4:18 # "End Roll" (Instrumental) – 4:49 # "End Roll" (Neuro- mantic Mix) [Bonus track] – 5:08 # "Monochrome" (Dub's full Color Remix) [Bonus track] – 6:43 *12" vinyl (titled A NYC) # "Monochrome" (Keith Litman's Big City Vocal Mix) – 9:35 # "Too Late" (Razor 'N Guido Remix) – 8:12 *Digital download # "Monochrome" – 4:29 # "Too Late" – 4:20 # "Trauma" – 4:18 # "End Roll" – 4:49 # "Monochrome" (Keith Litman's Big City Vocal Mix) – 9:35 # "Too Late" (Razor 'N Guido Remix) – 8:12 # "Trauma" (Heavy Shuffle Mix) – 6:10 # "End Roll" (Hal's Mix) – 4:16 # "Monochrome" (Instrumental) – 4:29 # "Too Late" (Instrumental) – 4:20 # "Trauma" (Instrumental) – 4:18 # "End Roll" (Instrumental) – 4:49 # "End Roll" (Neuro-mantic Mix) [Bonus track] – 5:08 # "Monochrome" (Dub's full Color Remix) [Bonus track] – 6:43 *12" vinyl (titled A TYO) # "Monochrome" (Keith Litman's Big City Vocal Mix) – 9:35 # "Too Late" (Razor 'N Guido Remix) – 8:12 # "Trauma" (Heavy Shuffle Mix) – 6:10 # "End Roll" (Hal's Mix) – 4:16 ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the CD liner notes of A; ;Recording *Recorded at Prime Sound Studio, Studio Sound Dali, Onkio Haus, Tokyo, Japan in 1999. ;Credits *Ayumi Hamasaki – vocals, songwriting, background vocals *Max Matsuura – production *Dai Nagao – composing, programming, mastering *HΛL – composing, synthesizers, keyboards *Naoto Suzuki – sound producing *Jun Kajiwara – electric guitar *Naoki Hayashibe – electric guitar *Hidetoshi Suzuki – electric guitar *Dave Ford – mixing *Dave Way – mixing ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1999) Peak position Japan Weekly Chart (Oricon) 1 Japan Weekly Count Down TV Chart (TBS) 1 ===Yearly chart=== Chart (1999) Peak position Japan (Oricon) 3 Japan Count Down TV (TBS) 6 ==Certifications and sales== ==Release history== Region Date Format Label Japan August 11, 1999 CD single + colored editions Hong Kong CD single Avex Trax Japan October 16, 2000 12" vinyl (titled NYC) Rhythm Republic 12" vinyl (titled TYO) Digital download September 2008 Avex Entertainment Inc.

In the Early Cyrillic alphabet its name was (azǔ), meaning "I". In the Cyrillic numeral system, the Cyrillic letter А has a value of 1. ==Form== Throughout history, the Cyrillic letter А has had various shapes, but today is standardised on one that looks exactly like the Latin letter A, including the italic and lower case forms. ==Usage== In most languages that use the Cyrillic alphabet – such as Bulgarian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Russian, Rusyn, Serbian, Macedonian and Montenegrin – the Cyrillic letter А represents the open central unrounded vowel . In Ingush and Chechen the Cyrillic letter А represents both the open back unrounded vowel and the mid-central vowel .

73863747	A (For 100 Cars)	A [For 100 Cars] is a minimalist composition by Ryoji Ikeda. It was written in 2017 and performed on 15 October as part of a Red Bull Music Academy festival held in Los Angeles. The piece is written for an "orchestra" of 100 cars, which produce sound using sine wave synthesisers. Each synthesiser is tuned to a different pitch that has been associated with the note A throughout history. The synthesisers were created by Tatsuya Takahashi and Masimillian Rest. == Composition == Ryoji Ikeda is a Japanese audiovisual artist and composer. He composed A [For 100 Cars] for part of a Red Bull Music Academy (RBMA) festival held in Los Angeles. The idea behind A [For 100 Cars] springs from Ikeda's curiosity with the various frequencies associated to the note A. Throughout history, A been associated with many different frequencies, before being standardised to 440 Hz in 1975 by the International Organization for Standardization. The use of cars in the composition was conceptualised six months prior to its performance, during a conversation between Ikeda and the co-founder of the RBMA, Torsten Schmidt. While talking about cars, they considered making an "automobile orchestra". They decided to use synthesisers to create the sounds emitted by the cars. The synthesisers used for the performance at the festival were designed by Tatsuya Takahashi, the synthesiser designer who formerly worked as chief engineer at Korg. The project was the first design Takahashi had made since leaving Korg. Takahashi partnered with Masimillian Rest of E-RM, a Berlin-based musical instrument maker, to create the synthesisers over a period of around three months. Ikeda views the composition as a collaboration between himself and the car drivers. When asked by LA Weekly, he was reluctant to take credit for the piece, saying: == Music == thumb|A [For 100 Cars] is scored for a group of 100 cars. A [For 100 Cars] is performed by a group of 100 cars. This arrangement was called "the world's largest synth orchestra" by Mixmag and Vice. A full performance of the piece lasts for around 27–28 minutes. Each car has a synthesiser connected to its sound system which constantly outputs a sine wave drone at a frequency that has been associated with the note A at some point in history, from 1361 to 1936. The frequencies range from 376.3 – 506.9 Hz. Some frequencies chosen by Ikeda include: * 376.3 Hz – A used by the organ of l'Hospice Comtesse (dated ) in Lille * 419.6 Hz – A used by the organ of Seville Cathedral * 422.7 Hz – A used by the tuning fork of John Broadwood and Sons, London (17th century) * 427 Hz – A used by the Paris Grand Opera (1811) * 430 Hz – A used by the tuning fork of Henry Lemoine (1810) * 457.2 Hz – A used by the tuning fork of Steinway and Sons (1879) == Performance == thumb|The premiere of A [For 100 Cars] took place opposite the Walt Disney Concert Hall.As the piece is loud (reaching almost 160dB), a safety test was completed in Cologne before the performance in Los Angeles. To make sure that it was a safe experience for the driver, Ikeda personally took part in the test. In the performance, all drivers were given a pair of headphones. The performance of A [For 100 Cars] took place on 15 October 2017 at a multi- storey car park at 131 South Olive Street, Los Angeles. This location is opposite the Walt Disney Concert Hall. The 100 cars used for the performance were lined up in rows on top of the car park. The performance began at dusk at 6:17pm in front of an audience of around 1000 people. At the start of the performance, the drivers started their engines and created a grumbling sound by revving them: a sound some likened to an orchestra tuning. The performers were from Los Angeles and were chosen by Ikeda for their car's modified stereos; no performer was a professional musician. The car's designs were varied and included sedans, SUVs and Los Angeles' signature lowriders. Each performer was given a score to read which dictated when to play the synthesiser, as well as the volume and octave (from A1 to A8). To better emit the sounds created by Takahashi's synthesisers, some drivers opted to open their car's doors. The performers included some notable residents of the area such as the photographer Estevan Oriol, who was driving his Chevrolet Impala SS. == Reception == A [For 100 Cars] received a mixed reception from reporters and audiences. It was widely seen as unusual: Selim Bulut of Dazed commented that the sound produced was an "unusual but calming ambient tone". Writing in Vice, Emily Manning agreed, saying that "the A notes sounded a bit like what you might expect to hear when UFOs land, but more peaceful, almost like a field of humming June bugs". In the Los Angeles Times, Randall Roberts wrote that the performance "felt like a feat not only of bringing imagination to life, but of organization and community". Jon Caramanica wrote in The New York Times that A [For 100 Cars] "turned negative space in the center of downtown Los Angeles into a sublime womb [and] felt like a meditation". Mixmag put the performance on their list of the best performances from the festival, and praised the "depth of thinking and originality behind the piece [which] made it a breathtaking experience for those in attendance". Other listeners were not as impressed. In Autoweek, Mark Vaughn wrote that "most of it sounded, frankly, kind of bland" but conceded that "it was kind of cool to experience". == References == === Sources === * == External links == * YouTube video explaining the project Category:2017 compositions Category:Minimalistic compositions Category:Music of Los Angeles
64020587	A (Indic)	A is a vowel of Indic abugidas. In modern Indic scripts, A is derived from the early "Ashoka" Brahmi letter 13px|ng after having gone through the Gupta letter 13px. Bare consonants without a modifying vowel sign have the "A" vowel inherently, and thus there is no modifier sign for "A" in Indic scripts. ==Āryabhaṭa numeration== Aryabhata used Devanagari letters for numbers, very similar to the Greek numerals, even after the invention of Indian numerals. The letter अ was not used in the Aryabhata number system, and consonants with the inherent "a" vowel retained their base value. ==Historic A== There are three different general early historic scripts - Brahmi and its variants, Kharoṣṭhī, and Tocharian, the so-called slanting Brahmi. A as found in standard Brahmi, 13px|A was a simple geometric shape, with variations toward more flowing forms by the Gupta 13px|A. Like all Brahmic scripts, the Tocharian A 18px|A is the inherent vowel for all consonant characters, apart from the alternate Fremdzeichen forms, which have the inherent vowel "Ä". In Kharoṣṭhī, the only independent vowel letter is for the inherent A, with all other independent vowels built from vowel marks added to A. ===Brahmi A=== The Brahmi letter 13px|A, A, is probably derived from the Aramaic Alef 13px, and is thus related to the modern Latin A and Greek Alpha. Several identifiable styles of writing the Brahmi A can be found, most associated with a specific set of inscriptions from an artifact or diverse records from an historic period.Evolutionary chart, Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal Vol 7, 1838 As the earliest and most geometric style of Brahmi, the letters found on the Edicts of Ashoka and other records from around that time are normally the reference form for Brahmi letters, with vowel marks not attested until later forms of Brahmi back-formed to match the geometric writing style. Brahmi A historic forms Ashoka (3rd-1st c. BCE) Girnar (~150 BCE) Kushana (~150-250 CE) Gujarat (~250 CE) Gupta (~350 CE) 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px ===Tocharian A=== The Tocharian letter 25px|A is derived from the Brahmi 13px|A. A is the inherent vowel of all non- Fremdzeichen consonants in Tocharian Ka Kha Ga Gha Ca Cha Ja Jha Nya Ṭa Ṭha Ḍa Ḍha Ṇa 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px Ta Tha Da Dha Na Pa Pha Ba Bha Ma Ya Ra La Va 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px 37px Śa Ṣa Sa Ha 37px 37px 37px 37px ===Kharoṣṭhī A=== The Kharoṣṭhī letter A is the only independent vowel in Kharosthi. It is derived from the Aramaic Alef 13px, and is thus related to A and Alpha, as well as the Brahmi A. ==Devanagari A== 100px|thumb|right|Devanagari A vowel A (अ) is a vowel of the Devanagari abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|A, after having gone through the Gupta letter 13px|A. Letters that derive from it are the Gujarati letter અ, and the Modi letter 𑘀. ===Devanagari Using Languages=== The Devanagari script is used to write the Hindi language, Sanskrit and the majority of Indo-Aryan languages. In most of these languages, अ is pronounced as . Like all Indic scripts, Devanagari vowels come in two forms: an independent vowel form for syllables that begin with a vowel sound. However, since /ə/ is the inherent vowel of all consonants, there is no need for an A vowel sign. ==Bengali A== 100px|thumb|right|Bengali A vowel A (অ) is a vowel of the Bengali abugida. It is derived from the Siddhaṃ letter 13px|A, and is marked by a similar horizontal head line, but less geometric shape, than its Devanagari counterpart, अ. ===Bengali Script Using Languages=== The Bengali script is used to write several languages of eastern India, notably the Bengali language and Assamese. In most languages, অ is pronounced as . Like all Indic scripts, Bengali vowels come in two forms: an independent vowel form for syllables that begin with a vowel sound. However, Bengali A represents the /ɔ/ vowel inherent in all consonants, and is thus indicated by the lack of any modifying vowel sign. ==Gujarati A== thumb|right|100px|Guajarati independent A vowel. A (અ) is a vowel of the Gujarati abugida. It is derived from the Devanagari A 13px|a, and ultimately the Brahmi letter 13px|a. ===Gujarati- using Languages=== The Gujarati script is used to write the Gujarati and Kutchi languages. In both languages, અ is pronounced as . Like all Indic scripts, Gujarati vowels come in two forms: an independent vowel form for syllables that begin with a vowel sound. However, since A is the inherent vowel in unmarked consonants, there is no A vowel sign in Gujarati. ==Javanese A== ==Telugu A== thumb|100px|Telugu independent vowel A A (అ) is a vowel of the Telugu abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|A. It is closely related to the Kannada letter ಅ. Like in other Indic scripts, "A" in Telugu is inherent in all consonants, and there is no vowel sign for the "A" vowel. ==Malayalam A== thumb|left|100px|Malayalam independent vowel A A (അ) is a vowel of the Malayalam abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|A, via the Grantha letter x15px|A a. Like in other Indic scripts, "A" is the inherent vowel of Malayalam consonants, so there is no modifying vowel sign for A. As in most Indic scripts, independent Malayalam vowels do not decompose into A with a vowel sign attached, but rather are unique characters themselves. Independent vowel letters in Malayalam are used when a word begins with a vowel, rather than a consonant sound. ==Odia A== thumb|100px|Odia A vowel A (ଅ) is a vowel of the Odia abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|A, via the Siddhaṃ letter x15px|A a. Like in other Indic scripts, Odia consonants inherently contain the "a" vowel, so there is no modifying sign for indicating that vowel. == Thai script == O ang (อ) and Ho nokhuk (ฮ) are the forty-third and forty-fourth letters of the Thai script. Unlike many Indic scripts, Thai consonants do not form conjunct ligatures, and use the pinthu—an explicit virama with a dot shape—to indicate bare consonants. === O ang === In IPA, O ang is pronounced as [ʔ] at the beginning of a syllable and not be used to close a syllable. It falls under the middle class of Thai consonants. In the acrophony of the Thai script, ang (อ่าง) means 'basin'. O ang corresponds to the Sanskrit character 'अ'. === Ho nokhuk === In IPA, Ho nokhuk is pronounced as [h] at the beginning of a syllable and not be used to close a syllable. It falls under the low class of Thai consonants. In the acrophony of the Thai script, nokhuk (นกฮูก) means 'owl'. ==Kaithi A== A (𑂃) is a vowel of the Kaithi abugida. It ultimately arose from the Brahmi letter 13px|, via the Siddhaṃ letter x15px| A. Like in other Indic scripts, the Kaithi vowel A is an independent letter and lacks a vowel sign, as "a" is inherent to the consonant letters. ==Comparison of A== The various Indic scripts are generally related to each other through adaptation and borrowing, and as such the glyphs for cognate letters, including A, are related as well. ==Character encodings of A== Most Indic scripts are encoded in the Unicode Standard, and as such the letter A in those scripts can be represented in plain text with unique codepoint. A from several modern-use scripts can also be found in legacy encodings, such as ISCII. ==References== Category:Indic letters
165709	A (Jethro Tull album)	A is the 13th studio album by British rock band Jethro Tull. It was released on 29 August 1980 in the UK and 1 September of the same year in the United States. The album was initially written and recorded with the intention of being frontman Ian Anderson's debut solo album (hence the album's title: the master tapes were marked "A" for Anderson during recording), however the album was eventually released as a Jethro Tull album after pressure from Chrysalis Records. Anderson has since stated that he regrets allowing the album to be released under the Jethro Tull name. Musically, the album was a departure from prior Tull works, adopting more of an electronic rock sound with heavy use of synthesizers, although still retaining the band's trademark folk influence and Anderson's flute playing. Lyrically, the album saw a similar departure from the fantasy and folklore themes of previous Tull work, instead emphasizing contemporary matters such as the Cold War. The album was the first Tull album released following a large lineup change which saw drummer Barrie "Barriemore" Barlow and keyboardists John Evan and Dee Palmer departing the band in 1980 while bassist John Glascock had died from heart complications the previous year. The album instead features Glascock's touring replacement Dave Pegg on bass in his first recorded appearance with the band, Mark Craney on drums and Eddie Jobson on keyboards (with Jobson credited as a "special guest") and electric violin. == Overview == A was recorded as an intended Ian Anderson solo album before Tull's record label, Chrysalis, asked that it become credited to the group. This is the reason for the album's title, as the tapes were marked "A" for "Anderson". It is noted for its more synthesiser-based sound, a fact which created controversy among many of the band's fans. On the other hand, it features a folk-influenced piece, "The Pine Marten's Jig". A features a dramatically different line-up of Tull from the band's previous album, Stormwatch (1979). Former keyboardist John Evan and organist Dee Palmer were fired from the group, while drummer Barriemore Barlow left the band due to depression over the death of John Glascock as well as plans to start his own band. The only members of Tull to appear on both Stormwatch (1979) and A (1980) are Ian Anderson and Martin Barre. This is also bassist Dave Pegg's first appearance on a Tull studio recording, but he had become a member of the band during the Stormwatch tour in 1979, replacing the deceased Glascock. Conflicting reasons have been given for the line-up change. Anderson has stated that he wanted to take the band in a different direction from the folk rock and progressive rock of the 1970s.A New Day Yesterday: The 25th Anniversary Collection, 1969–1994 Barriemore Barlow was unhappy with the direction the band was taking and later stated that he would have left anyway. However, biographer David Rees reports in his book Minstrels in the Gallery: A History of Jethro Tull (2001) that Anderson had never intended to replace Jethro Tull's previous line-up with the musicians who recorded A, but was forced by Chrysalis Records, which had decided to release his 'solo' album under the name Jethro Tull. This claim was further evidenced by Anderson's note in the 2003 re-release of the album. A 40th anniversary box set was released in April 2021, featuring the album remixed by Steven Wilson. It includes some bonus tracks, a DVD of Slipstream, and audio of a concert in Los Angeles. == Track listing == *The 2004 remastered two-disc edition includes Slipstream as a bonus DVD. === 2021 40th Anniversary A La Mode Edition === == Personnel == Jethro Tull * Ian Anderson – vocals, flute * Martin Barre – guitar * Dave Pegg – bass guitar, mandolin * Mark Craney – drums Additional personnel * Eddie Jobson – keyboards, synthesizer, electric violin on The Pine Marten's Jig technical staff * Robin Black – sound engineer * John Shaw – photography * Peter Wagg – art direction ==Charts== 1980 chart performance for A Chart (1980) Peak position Australian Albums (Kent Music Report) 47 2021 chart performance for A Chart (2021) Peak position == References == == External links == * * (Bonus DVD) Category:Jethro Tull (band) albums Category:1980 albums Category:Chrysalis Records albums Category:Island Records albums Category:Albums produced by Ian Anderson

58726751	A (Los Angeles Railway)	A refers to several streetcar routes in Los Angeles, California. The lines were operated by the Los Angeles Railway and its successor, Los Angeles Transit Lines, from 1920 to 1946. ==History== ;1920–1932 Los Angeles Railway rerouted many lines on May 9, 1920, assigning them letter designations the following year. The A line ran along Adams; Normandie Avenue; 24th; Hoover; Burlington; 16th; Hill; 1st; Spring; North Main; Sunset; North Broadway; Lincoln Park Avenue; looping back via Nort Main to Plaza; thence to west terminal over above route. In 1924, the lines was split in two and was given numeric designations. The 2 West Adams and North Main Street Line operated on those streets as well as a portion of the former C Griffith and Griffin Avenue Line. The 3 West Adams and Lincoln Park Line also ran on Main Street. In 1926, the A-2 was rerouted to Griffin Park. The two routes were recombined in 1930 as a single A line. ;1932–1939 A new A line started service on June 12, 1932. It was formed by the Adams Avenue segment of the former service and the Angeleno Heights segment of the G Griffith and Angeleno Heights Line. A branch at Edgeware Road opened in 1934, and the main service was rerouted on this line starting in 1938. ;1939–46 The final and longest lived routing of the A began service on September 25, 1939. It was predominantly formed from the old A line as well as Temple Street taken from the L West 11th and West Temple Street Line. Tracks on Fountain were removed from service in 1942, and the line ceased to operate on June 30, 1946. ==Sources== ==External links== * A Line Archives — Pacific Electric Railway Historical Society * Category:Los Angeles Railway routes Category:Railway services introduced in 1895 Category:1895 establishments in California Category:Railway services discontinued in 1946 Category:1946 disestablishments in California

The series concluded with the third and final “Uber A” being revealed as Alex Drake, the twin sister of Spencer Hastings. In the fourth Pretty Little Liars series, Original Sin, Archie Waters takes the identity of "A", working together with his father, Marshall Clanton. == Development == === Characterization === In the original television series, all three characters who take up the identity of "A" are mentally ill women seeking revenge for something that has negatively altered their lives. “A” frequently manipulates, blackmails, and tortures. “A” has a love for riddles and dolls, usually referring to the Liars as their own living dolls. In Original Sin and the novels, "A" kills multiple people in order to achieve their goals. == Novels storylines == === The first "A" === * Real identity: Mona Vanderwaal. Three years after the disappearance of Alison DiLaurentis, her four friends, Aria Montgomery, Spencer Hastings, Emily Fields, and Hanna Marin each receive messages from someone calling themselves "A". The girls had drifted apart over the years, so they had no idea that other people were getting texts as well. Additionally, the texts were about secrets only Alison knew about. At first, the messages were simply teasing and all of the girls wonder if their missing friend was the one who sent them. Though they knew she was most likely dead, she was still the only one who knew their darkest secrets. Once Alison's body is discovered in her old backyard, the girls are even more baffled when they continue to receive threats. At Alison's funeral, the girls are reunited and they find out that they've all been receiving weird messages. As the girls stand outside after the funeral ends, they all get a text saying, "I'm still here, bitches. And I know everything. –A". From that point on, the messages take on a distinctly more threatening tone. Aria is given an ultimatum to tell her mother about her father's affair by midnight after the Foxy event, or A will do it for her. A continues to play life-altering games with the girls, from encouraging suspicion of Spencer's involvement in Alison's death to outing Emily's sexuality to her conservative mother. However, A makes a serious mistake in texting Hanna on the night of Mona's birthday party. Instead of using the plain Blackberry she bought just for tormenting the girls, A accidentally uses his/her own phone. Hanna, who has a new phone without all of her contacts recognizes the number, compelling A to act before Hanna can reveal A's true identity to the others. A hits Hanna with an SUV, successfully destroying Hanna's phone and putting her into a coma that eventually leads to a temporary loss of memory. A knew that there was a very good chance Hanna would regain her memory. Hanna's best friend, Mona Vanderwaal, informs the girls that she has also received texts from A, drawing the five closer together in trying to figure out who their tormentor is. Mona subtly encourages Spencer's fears that her sister, Melissa, might be A as well as Alison's killer. During Hanna's recovery masquerade celebration, she suddenly regains her memory, revealing that Mona is A. However, she, Emily, and Aria can't do much about it, because Spencer and Mona are on their way to the police station. After Spencer is warned about Mona by text, she tries to escape Mona's car, but Mona catches on rather quickly and diverts to a path in a more remote area of Rosewood. She tells Spencer everything, from seeing Alison launch a firework into Toby Cavanaugh's garage that blinded her friend Jenna, to finding Alison's diary of secrets among a pile of old DiLaurentis junk the St. Germains left at the curb, discovering the girls' secrets that only Alison knew. Her motivation was to get revenge for her friend's blindness, even though Jenna and Alison had planned together to launch the firework. Mona didn't know this and got a scar on her stomach from the ordeal. Mona also drops the bombshell that Ian Thomas killed Alison, due to Alison's last diary entry about giving him an ultimatum to break up with Melissa. She then offers Spencer to become A with her and tells Hanna that she must not be remembering correctly, but she refuses. The two fight at Floating Man's Quarry and Spencer accidentally pushes Mona, who falls and has her neck caught between rocks. === The second "A" === *Real Identity Alison DiLaurentis. Alison DiLaurentis lived a life that she felt was ruined by her twin sister, Courtney DiLaurentis who was smarter and kinder. Alison began emotionally manipulating Courtney into pretending to be Alison until she eventually tricked Courtney into pretending to strangle her. Courtney is sent to a mental hospital as a result and the ashamed DiLaurentis' erase all trace of her, Alison becomes Queen Bee at her new school. Courtney is allowed a short trip home to meet with her family, but whilst there sees Spencer, Hannah, Aria and Emily arguing outside and goes out to talk to them. Because of this, her parents believe she is Alison, the real Alison insists she's Alison, but because of her manipulating Courtney into pretending to be her, they think she is lying. A vengeful Alison is taken away to the Mental Hospital. The girls began receiving messages from 'A' again, scaring them greatly. First believing it to be a cruel joke, they then discover Ian Thomas's body which the second 'A' had murdered. 'A' then steals Ian's body convincing everyone else that it was a hoax. 'A' mocks the girls over text and pretends to be Ian on an online account, giving the girls information such as Spencer being the product of an affair between her father and Alison's father. 'A' allows Spencer to be scammed out of $2000, taunts Aria with photos, manipulates Hanna so she is sent to a mental hospital and forces Emily to go to Lancaster to look into Wilden. 'A' sends the girls on many searches to try and find who 'A' could be and murders Jenna. They eventually plant all the evidence of a random person. The girls are fooled by this, happy it is over. The town is introduced to Courtney DiLaurentis who is Alison's ill twin sister who was kept in many clinics and hidden from the world. Courtney reveals herself to the girls as actually being Alison and that Courtney was pretending to be her and that she was the one who ran into the random person and died. Aria is suspicious, along with Wilden and Melissa. Melissa knew about the twins for a while because Jason and Alison's stories didn't match up with what Jason told her. The suspected murderer has an alibi and people begin digging up suspicious things about Alison. Alison kidnaps Melissa and traps her in a cupboard next to Ian's dead body. At Alison's house, all of the girls get drunk and re-enact the day Alison went missing, they wake up to find a letter revealing that Courtney took Alison's place when they were young and the person the girls were friends with was actually Courtney whilst Alison was sent to a mental hospital in her place. When she came back, Alison killed Courtney. Alison sets the house on fire with the girls in it, but they manage to turn the tables on her and escape with Melissa. The girls hope she was killed in the explosion, but Emily left the door open for her. After the third 'A', Nick, has been arrested in her escape, Alison escapes to a house even Nick had no clue about and uses all of Nick's money for plastic surgery. Then, under a new alias, she begins tormenting the girls again. An obsessed fan group starts harassing the girls and she hires one, named Greg, to infiltrate the Liars. He starts dating Spencer in hopes to do this, which works. She also pretends to be a famous artist's secretary to ruin Aria's potential career. She attempts to drown Emily in a pool for rejecting her and then murders her girlfriend Jordan which drives Emily to depression. Alison then frames the girls for her torture and murder by covering a house they broke into with her blood and weapons, and the girls are arrested. Alison is able to avoid the girls as they attempt to find her before they are inevitably imprisoned. Alison is elated to discover she has driven Emily to drown herself and made Aria flee the country. Little did she know, Emily faked her death and managed to track Alison to her mother's house where she was hiding out. Alison confronts Emily with a gun and the two fight, with Emily holding off Alison long enough for the police to arrive. Alison is then arrested and the girls are exonerated. === The third "A" === *Real Identity Nick Maxwell. A third "A" begins tormenting the girls. Emily hopes it's Alison, and the rest of the girls hope it's not, though it is likely she survived the explosion regardless. The new "A" torments them about the Jamaica incident, Spencer's framing of Kelsey, Hanna's framing of Madison, and Emily's baby. "A" reveals that they killed Tabitha, which means they have killed four people total - the other three being Gayle, Kyla, and Graham - and have injured many more, which makes this "A" the most violent yet. The girls suspect this "A" isn't just Alison, as she would not be strong enough to kill and hurt so many people by herself and begin to consider she has an accomplice. The girls are lured to a basement where Alison reveals that she is alive and that the third "A" is not her, but Nick Maxwell. Nick was Courtney's older boyfriend who met the real Alison at their shared mental clinic and has introduced himself to the girls as different people throughout their lives. Phineas, who sold Spencer drugs and got her addicted to them, eventually causing her to frame Kelsey for drugs; Jackson, a bartender who refused to help Hanna, causing her to get into a car crash with Madison; Olaf, Aria's Icelandic friend who stole a painting with her; Derrick, Emily's colleague who she would regularly gossip to. Nick and Alison have put a shrine to Alison in the basement and are going to make it seem as if the girls have killed themselves in honor of Alison. They leave and flood the basement with poisonous gas, but Nick is found and arrested by the police and the girls are saved. Alison escapes and abandons Nick to prison. Nick is later visited in prison by the girls and tells them Alison may be at his grandma's house or something connecting to her may be there. == Television storylines == === Pretty Little Liars === ==== Original "A" ==== Original A was the first "A" and was revealed to be Mona Vanderwaal. Mona began torturing Alison by sending her gifts, threats and soon attacking her while wearing a zombie costume. "A" continued to mess with Ali and her mother Jessica DiLaurentis, whom she believed it to be Spencer Hastings. After Alison's disappearance, "A" went away for a year but after the corpse of Bethany Young (believed to be Alison at the time) was found, she reemerged. "A" began sending the Liars messages about things only Alison knew about them and soon even began messing with their parents. Doctor Anne Sullivan had previously dealt with the person behind the hoodie and when "A" trashed her office she immediately recognized the person. She almost exposes her identity to the Liars but "A" kidnaps her and went as far as to threaten her son's life. But the Liars are still close to figuring it out and during the second half of season two they manage to get a hold of "A's" phone. They hatch a plan to catch her with this and it works. They find out that "A" had a lair at the Lost woods resort and Spencer and Mona ("A's" newest victim) head over there and find a room full of pictures of Alison and the girls along with a sketch of "A's" costume to the ball, The Black Swan. However, Spencer begins to notice other clues and soon realizes "A" is right there with her. She turns around to see Mona in a black hoodie, who reveals herself as "A". She kidnaps Spencer and gives her an opportunity to join the "A" team but Spencer declines and the two get into a fight, where Mona is pushed off of a cliff. Though Mona survives, she is sent to Radley Sanitarium for medical assistance. While in the psychiatric hospital, Mona takes up a partnership suggested by the then unknown CeCe Drake that starts off the second game. After this, Mona became another henchman in the "A" hierarchy, obeying the orders of CeCe, whom she knew as Red Coat. Mona was kicked off of the A-Team in the season three finale. However, Mona joins the new "A.D." team in Season 7, after "A.D." sends Wren to kill her and she offers to help instead. She helps them kidnap Spencer and wears a Melissa mask, but ultimately turns on them and brings the Liars to them, as well as a cop. However, this turns out to be a ruse and the "cop" is actually Mona's French boyfriend, who helps her take Mary and Alex (the two remaining members) to France to live in her own personal Dollhouse. Mona is the final "A" of the series, being the "winner" of the game... ==== Big "A" ==== Big A was the person who took over the "A" game from Mona Vanderwaal after she was admitted to Radley Sanitarium and revealed to be CeCe Drake (A.K.A. Charlotte DiLaurentis or Charles Dilaurentis). She had visited Mona in Radley and used her to get information about the Liars before taking over the game herself and had used the A-Team, which consisted of her ally Sara, Jenna, Noel, Wren, Wilden, Mona, Toby, Lucas, Melissa, and Spencer, to do her dirty work and sometimes went under the Red Coat disguise. Big A often hid out at a lair situated in Room A at an apartment building at Mayflower Hill and a mobile RV which was stolen but Toby gave it back to "A" in exchange for information about his mother's death. It is revealed that Charlotte had been hiding out in the basement of the DiLaurentis house and drilled holes through the floor to spy on the family in her Red Coat disguise and shared the identity with Alison. Her disguise as Red Coat was exposed in the fourth season mid finale when Emily was trapped on a saw at Ravenswood and later got into a fight with Aria who discovered her identity and Charlotte later fell off a platform and escaped. In A' Is for Answers", the Liars are under attack by "A" who shoots Ezra Fitz on the rooftop. However, in the fifth-season premiere, the shooter is revealed to be Shana Fring who attempted to kill Alison but was later shoved off a stage by Aria and died from the impact. After all of this, Charlotte fled to France under the Vivian Darkbloom identity to escape custody for Wilden's death but returned. In the series' 100th episode, Charlotte planted a bomb in the Cavanaugh house which detonated, signaling her triumphant return to Rosewood. In season five, CeCe breaks into the Vanderwaal home and kidnaps Mona just as she is about to tell the Liars that Alison is "A" and covers up her kidnapping as a homicide. She then brings Mona to the Dollhouse and tortures her and forces her to dress up and act like Alison. Just as the Liars are being brought to jail, CeCe kidnaps them and tortures them inside the Dollhouse. Inside, the liars discover that Big "A" is named Charlotte DiLaurentis. CeCe/Charlotte reveals herself as "A" and tells her story; saying that she is transgender, was formerly known as Charles DiLaurentis, and became "A" because the Liars were happy that Alison was gone. She worked with Sara Harvey, who was the Black Widow and a decoy Red Coat, and was also responsible for the "death" of Alison and the death of Wilden, and after telling her story, she attempts suicide by jumping off Radley but is stopped. She is admitted to Welby State and her reign as "A" finally ends and stays in the psychiatric hospital for five years. When she is released, Charlotte is murdered by Mona Vanderwaal and her death causes the birth of "A.D.", the new Uber A. After her death, it is revealed that Noel Kahn and Jenna Marshall were also working for Charlotte. It is also revealed that her birth mother is Jessica's twin, Mary Drake, and her birth father is Ted Wilson, while Spencer is her sister. The series finale reveals that "A.D." is her sister and Spencer's twin, Alex Drake, whom Charlotte met after boarding the plane to France. She and Alex become very close after meeting, until Charlotte returned to Rosewood to play the game some more. Alex reveals that Charlotte never returned to her in London and the next time she saw her was when she visited her grave. ====Uber "A"==== Uber A, also known as A.D., is the third person to take over the identity of "A". In the show's series finale, Uber A's identity is revealed to be Alex Drake, Spencer's twin sister who was put up for adoption at birth. She desperately craves vengeance over the tragic passing of Charlotte DiLaurentis, who was her half-sister, and is trying to seek out the person responsible. Unlike Mona or Charlotte, Alex does not use any nicknames at first but instead signs their messages with emojis, which differentiates her from the A-Team. This causes Caleb to nickname her Amoji. However, in the sixth-season finale, she begins using the alias "A.D." and kidnaps Hanna, whom she believes is accountable for her sister's homicide. Hanna manages to escape Uber A's clutches and Alex goes after Alison, who the Liars suggested as guilty for her own cousin's murder. Uber A eventually finds out that Alison is innocent after searching her jacket. While Uber A does work on their own, she also works through a new "A-Team" of helpers, known to consist of Jenna Marshall, Sydney Driscoll, and Aria Montgomery, who are assisting them in completing the endgame. The series finale explains that Alex Drake was put up for adoption in exchange for a sum of money (for Mary), but then left at an orphanage by her adopted parents who were concerned for their image. She ran away from the orphanage at ten years old and eventually started working in a bar in London, where Wren Kingston mistook her for Spencer, revealing the existence of Alex's twin and Charlotte. Wren introduces Charlotte and Alex in an airport (just after Charlotte met Archer Dunhill) and they immediately connect, becoming very close in a short amount of time. After Charlotte is released from Welby, she tells Alex that she wishes to return to Rosewood and resume the game, but Alex says she shouldn't go unless she gets to come too, since she wants to meet Spencer. Charlotte says no and describes the Hastings as "toxic people" before leaving for Rosewood, where she was murdered by Mona. Alex is enraged and forces Wren to shoot her so that she looks exactly like Spencer and can successfully impersonate her. She then goes to Rosewood and picks up the game as "Uber A". Alex has made several appearances where she impersonates Spencer, including, but not limited to: The run in with Ezra at the airport where she introduced Wren, the kiss between "Spencer" and Toby just before the latter planned to leave Rosewood with Yvonne, and Hanna's "dream" where she "hallucinated" Spencer while A.D held her hostage. The latter was done so that Alex could find out whether Hanna was telling the truth about killing Charlotte. === Original Sin === In Original Sin, A is revealed to be Archie Waters. Archie is the illegitimate son of Rose Waters and Marshall Clanton, whose clandestine affair during high school resulted in Rose's pregnancy with Archie and his twin sister, Angela. Rose never let Archie out of the house and keep his existence a secret because he has a disfigured face. Later, Clanton became the vice-principal of Millwood High School and Rose returned so Angela can attend the school and have proper education. He and Rose decided to not tell Angela his identity as her father. In high school, Angela desperately wanted to fit in and joined Davie Adams's popular group. The group often did their best to embarrass, humiliate, and degrade Angela. When Angela was raped by Davie's boyfriend, Tom Beasley, Davie forced the group to turn their backs on her. Davie made sure everyone in the school treated her as invisible and worthless. During a New Year's Eve party in 1999, Angela committed suicide in public after her pleas for help was ignored by everyone. 22 years later, Archie take the identity of "A" to help his father avenge Angela and begins killing people who are considered bullies. ==The A-Team == The A-Team is a group of anonymous characters that worked together as "A". The team would work under the orders of the "A" in charge, who has been Mona Vanderwaal, the original leader and founder, CeCe Drake, the second leader, and Alex Drake, the final leader. Alex's team is also referred to as the "A.D.-Team". === Members === ==== Sara Harvey ==== Sara was the right-hand woman to Charlotte and also revealed as an A-Team member halfway throughout the sixth season. She has also been a Red Coat and was revealed as the Black Widow. She then became Charlotte's friend and ally in the "A" game and assisted her in most of her schemes. Sara was allegedly diagnosed with Stockholm syndrome following Charlotte's arrest but later discloses to Alison that she lied under oath, also admitting that she and Charlotte were, in fact, close friends and she felt as though they were sisters. Later, Sara was possibly enlisted by Jenna Marshall and Noel Kahn (and possibly "A.D.") to work with them. However, Sara was killed by Noel after she tried to reveal more than she should to Emily._ ==== Sydney Driscoll ==== Sydney was Uber A's helper for a brief period of time. She is first seen communicating with them through text messages when she makes a donation under their name at the Vogel Vision Institute. When Aria and Emily confront her, Driscoll claims that she is simply representing a client who prefers to remain anonymous. However, she returns in the following episode and reveals herself to be "A.D.". She offers Aria the chance to join their team, but Aria realizes that Sydney is communicating with someone through an earpiece, revealing that she's just a minion. Aria asks her why she would join their tormentor and Driscoll replies that she wants to be part of the "winning team". However, Uber A, who reveals herself as Spencer's twin sister Alex Drake, reveals in the series finale that Sydney wasn't involved in the Blind School shooting and joined the A-Team because Alex found out she had been stealing from a bank and she fit the hoodie. ==== Toby Cavanaugh ==== Toby was recruited by Mona to join the A-Team when he got a job in Bucks County. When this happened, Spencer found out on the night she was planning their anniversary dinner. His participation in the team was revealed in the finale of Season 3A. He worked hand in hand with Mona and did most of the dirty work for the team, like running down Lucas and attacking Hanna. However, like Mona, he didn't know the identity of Red Coat. Spencer finds out about his betrayal and goes off the deep end, especially after discovering his corpse. However, it is revealed that he is alive and well, with the corpse being a trick by Mona and Red Coat that he says he didn't know about until after. He is also revealed to be a double agent and gets kicked off the team. ==== Spencer Hastings ==== Spencer joined the A-Team briefly near the ending of the third season after being told Toby joined previously she thought this was a way to keep close to him. Initially, Spencer was extremely determined to be part of the team. However, she later unfolds the truth behind the disappearance of Toby and became a double agent as well. Like Toby, she got kicked off from the team. She is the "A" who kidnapped Malcolm, causing a break up between Ezra and Aria. ==== Lucas Gottesman ==== Lucas was the personal assistant to Mona. He was blackmailed by Mona and the A-Team into sending texts and doing their dirty work. Lucas claims his blackmail began after Mona discovered he was selling test answers. However, Mona later discloses that Lucas was the "A" who gave Emily a massage back in the second season while Mona was off riding with Hanna. During the seventh- season episode "Hold Your Piece", Pastor Ted Wilson reveals to Hanna that he used to run a summer camp for troubled boys, and Charlotte was a camper there prior to her transition. Wilson is disheartened when describing that he interacted with his offspring without awareness they were related. Ted then showcases Hanna a picture of himself back when he worked at the camp, chaperoning Charles and Lucas, whom he described as his son's "only friend". ==== Melissa Hastings ==== Melissa was blackmailed by Mona into wearing the Black Swan disguise to the Masquerade Ball in order to distract Jenna. Mona threatened to reveal her fake pregnancy if she didn't obey her orders. Later, Melissa got onto the Halloween Train dressed as the Queen of Hearts and drugged Aria. Melissa and Wilden then attempted to push her off of the train in a box with Garrett's dead body. It is implied that she was once again blackmailed. It is implied in "A Dark Ali" that Melissa is once again working for "A", as she is seen handing a recording (presumed stolen by "A") to a man resembling Cyrus Petrillo and later implies to Spencer that "A" has something in store for Ali and the Liars. ==== Darren Wilden ==== Wilden was also part of the team as he was the Queens of Hearts responsible for trying to kill Aria. He also murdered Garrett Reynolds, fearing he'd expose him as a crooked cop and placed his corpse in a box beside a fainted Aria. Wilden's reasoning for helping the team is unknown but implied to be blackmail. ==== Jenna Marshall ==== Jenna was a member of the A-Team during the reign of Big A and was also working anonymously for Uber A. She returns to Rosewood in Season 7 and in "Along Comes Mary" and befriends Sara Harvey. Meanwhile, Aria Montgomery and Emily Fields discover that Jenna was on Archer's payroll for unknown reasons. On the episode's closing scene, Jenna and Sara are having drinks at The Radley when an unknown figure approaches the two and reveals themselves to be Noel Kahn, who proceeds to join the duo. When confronted by Emily in regards to her involvement with Archer during "Wanted: Dead or Alive", Jenna admits she befriended Charlotte DiLaurentis after reading about her stay at Welby and reached out. In a flashback, Charlotte enlists Jenna's help to track down the whereabouts of her birth mother and come up with an alias for Archer. The pseudonym "Elliott Rollins" was later created so Archer could deliberately meet Alison and take advantage of her good intentions to benefit Charlotte's eventual release from the psychiatric hospital. In "The DArkest Knight", all of the Liars get a text message, ordering them to head over to 1465, Elm Street. After being lured to an abandoned school for blind students, they're held hostage by Noel and Jenna, tracking them down at gunpoint. During the cat-and-mouse chase, Jenna takes aim at the Liars only to backfire, until a second gunshot is heard and it injures Spencer. As Marshall prepares to finish her off, Mary Drake suddenly emerges from behind and knocks her out. While Drake attempts to help Spencer, an unknown figure drags Jenna away from the building. On the closing scene of the episode, the anonymous entity places her in the back of a van, while she questions them if they were responsible for the gunshot that hit Spencer. As the mysterious figure proceeds to rip off an old man's mask and toss it over to Jenna's side, Marshall feels it up and realizes that A.D. was the one who rescued her. At the end of "Playtime", Jenna is seated in A.D.'s lair, sipping tea. She thanks the unidentified individual for the drink and reminds them of their promise to update her on the "game". Dressed in a nurse's uniform, A.D. drops a binder on Marshall's lap with pages of information written in braille. After Jenna reads a paragraph, she mutters the word "endgame" and grins in delight. During "These Boots Were Made for Stalking", Jenna walks into the police station in order to come clean about her actions and interrupts a conversation between Spencer and detective Marco Furey. Marshall reports that she kept a low profile after the events that took place at the abandoned school for blind students to avoid being harmed by Noel. According to Jenna, Noel was accountable for Sara Harvey's homicide and she feared to be his ensuing victim. Kahn recruited Jenna with the assertion that Charlotte left enough money in her will to afford Marshall another eye surgery. Nevertheless, Jenna suspected Noel of stealthily plotting to steal the cash all to himself since his parents had financially cut him off. In an attempt to spare her life, Marshall brought a gun to the deserted sight school as an act of self-defense and pretended to hold a grudge against the Liars. After Jenna describes her side of the story, Furey orders one of his associates to escort Marshall to a conference room so she can make an official statement. As Jenna exits the room, Spencer claims that she's an unreliable narrator. However, Furey informs Spencer that the authorities don't have enough evidence against Marshall because the bullet that injured Spencer didn't match the gun found at the location. Later in the episode, Caleb confronts Jenna stating that the authorities were already detecting holes in her allegations. However, Marshall assures Caleb they won't be able to prosecute her since Noel was the only person who could contradict her statement. In the series finale, Spencer's twin, Alex Drake, is revealed to be "A.D.". She reveals that Jenna was looking for her and recruited Noel to help. However, Jenna was desperate for another chance to see and offered to help her in the game. ==== Noel Kahn ==== Noel Kahn served as one of Big A/Charlotte's former minions and worked for her at the Dollhouse, having been responsible for placing blood all over Spencer Hastings to convince she had hurt someone. Noel became the prime suspect for Uber A, particularly after Alison reveals that he was the one who pushed the girl down a flight of stairs during the UPenn frat party. Hanna abducts him at the end of "The Wrath of Kahn" in an attempt to obtain a video confession that proves he's "A.D."/Uber A. In the following episode "The DArkest Knight", she instead ends up slashing his leg with a knife in order to test his DNA and see if it matches Mary Drake's. The results later come back negative and Kahn ends up escaping. Noel and Jenna later lure the Liars to an abandoned school for blind students so they could be held hostage and eventually murdered. During a cat-and-mouse chase, Kahn ends up stumbling upon an axe that decapitates his head after failing to fight Emily and Hanna. In the following episode, "Playtime", Detective Marco Furey informs Spencer that Jenna and Noel frequently visited Archer Dunhill at Welby. During "These Boots Were Made for Stalking", Jenna walks into the police station in order to come clean about her actions and interrupts a conversation between Spencer and detective Marco Furey. Marshall reports that she kept a low profile after the events that took place at the abandoned school for blind students to avoid being harmed by Noel. According to Jenna, Noel was accountable for Sara Harvey's homicide and she feared to be his ensuing victim. Kahn recruited Jenna with the assertion that Charlotte left enough money in her will to afford Marshall another eye surgery. Nevertheless, Jenna suspected Noel of stealthily plotting to steal the cash all to himself since his parents had financially cut him off. In an attempt to spare her life, Marshall brought a gun to the deserted sight school as an act of self-defense and pretended to hold a grudge against the Liars. However, when Caleb later confronts Jenna about the authorities detecting holes in her allegations, she informs him that the only person who could contradict her side of the story was Noel. It is unknown if Noel knew Jenna was working for "A.D." and was also working for them or if Jenna was working for "A.D." separately from their operation. ==== Aria Montgomery ==== Aria is "A.D.'s" helper. Aria is given the offer to join the team in "Power Play". She accepts in the following episode and begins supplying information to Uber A. After the Liars discover Lucas' graphic novel, Aria is sent by Uber A to retrieve it. Once she delivers it, she is given an "A" hoodie in return. She breaks into Alison's house sporting the disguise and trashes the nursery for her baby. In the next episode, Aria is sent by "A.D." to deliver a "gift" to the Hastings family. She connects to their Bluetooth and leaves a burner phone there to play a video recording of Peter and Mary discussing Jessica's murder. She later gets back into her "A" disguise and breaks into Alison's house to put the puzzle piece onto the game board and retrieve her file. "A.D." contacts Aria again and gives her a phone to communicate on. "A.D." asks Aria to meet them and to wear the uniform to do so. Mona overhears the call and tells the Liars of Aria's involvement with the A-Team. Aria gets into her "A" hoodie and goes to meet "A.D.", only to be confronted by the Liars. She then officially defects from the team and rejoins the Liars. ==== Mary Drake ==== Mary joins the A.D.-Team after the time jump, when Mona breaks her out of prison for Alex and she then helps Alex with kidnapping Spencer and keeping her locked away in the bunker. When Alex tries to kill Spencer, Mary tries to convince her to just keep her locked up, but Alex refuses and punches her to keep her from interfering. Mary and Alex are then kidnapped by Mona and kept as her dolls in her own personal dollhouse. Mary is also Jessica DiLaurentis' killer and implied to be the "A" who buried her. It is unknown if Mary was on the A-Team prior to the series finale or was simply forced into joining to keep Spencer locked up. ==== Wren Kingston ==== Wren was a member of the A-Team and is one of the helpers to Alex/Uber A. He helped CeCe/Charlotte sneak into Radley with fake visitors passes to visit Mona and later informs her of Alex's existence. When Alex takes over, he shoots her so that she will have the same scar as Spencer and then later comes to Welby to kill Mona as "A.D." for Alex, only stopping once Mona says she can help get Mary out. Alex kills Wren so that she doesn't have to break up with him in order to get her endgame wishes. Despite Wren being the only person to know almost everything about Alex's game, he doesn't participate much during the actual game, only doing a few things for Alex. == Other "A's" == === Shana Fring === Shana pretended to be "A" to attack the Liars in New York. She donned a black hoodie and attacked them at the coffee shop, only to end up shooting Ezra instead, who had found out her identity. In the following episode, she continued to hunt down the Liars, and sent a group of black hoodies to trick them. The black hoodies used the alias "A" during their taunting of the Liars. Shana revealed herself to the girls and revealed that she wanted justice for Jenna. The Liars falsely believed that Shana was Big A. == Disguises == Although typically wearing a signature black hoodie and gloves, “A” has worn a variety of disguises in the television series to spy on the Liars at various parties and events. === Red Coat === Red Coat is a disguise used by two members of the A-Team. Consisting of a knee length red trench coat, black skinny jeans and black heeled ankle boots, CeCe Drake took on the disguise to lead the A-Team and go out in public. Drake also hired Sara Harvey to act as a decoy whenever she couldn't sport the disguise in her assignments. Alison DiLaurentis occasionally used the disguise to protect her friends without revealing she was alive. === The Black Widow === The Black Widow is a previously anonymous character who attended detective Darren Wilden's funeral in 'A' Is for A-l-i- v-e". The disguise is all black clothing, with her face concealed by a black veil. The Black Widow is later shown to be a part of the A-Team, when she is seen inside the "A" R.V. placing a Mona doll with the rest of the "A" doll collection. She then lifts up her veil to reveal a burned Ali mask underneath, revealing that she was the Red Coat at the Lodge. In the fifth season, the disguise is seen inside one of "A's" lairs. In "Game Over, Charles", it is revealed that Sara Harvey was the Black Widow. Charlotte sent her to Wilden's funeral to make sure he was deceased. In "Of Late I Think of Rosewood", Sara shows up to Charlotte's funeral in a variation of the disguise, though this time revealing her face. In a nightmare that Alison had during "How the 'A' Stole Christmas", her mom, Jessica DiLaurentis shows up as the Black Widow. === The Queen of Hearts === The Queen of Hearts is a previously anonymous character that made an appearance during the third season's Halloween special, "This Is a Dark Ride". In the fourth season's premiere, it is revealed that there were actually two of them in the Halloween train, Melissa Hastings and Darren Wilden. Wilden attacked Spencer and fought Paige, while Melissa drugged Aria and took her body. Wilden also murdered Garrett Reynolds fearing he'd expose his corrupt activities and Melissa later admits to Spencer that she was blackmailed into doing his bidding. However, in Mona's footage, evidence shows that Wilden tried to abandon the train and Melissa is heard ordering him to stay. Wilden would later place a fainted Aria in a box beside Garrett's corpse and then gathered with Melissa in an attempt to push them off the train. They fled the scene once Aria regained her consciousness and stabbed Wilden. === The Black Swan === The Black Swan is a previously anonymous character that made an appearance during the Masquerade Ball. Melissa was revealed to be the person behind the disguise in "Birds of a Feather". She claimed that "A" (Mona) threatened her, stating that her false pregnancy would've been exposed if she did not distract Jenna during the event. The disguise is inspired by Odile from Swan Lake. == References == Category:Pretty Little Liars characters Category:Literary characters introduced in 2006 Category:Fictional murderers Category:Fictional kidnappers Category:Fictional hackers Category:Fictional stalkers Category:Fictional blackmailers Category:Female literary villains Category:American female characters in television

There were even some members who cried. There’s also a lot of pressure in that we have to work harder and do better. We’re still very grateful and thankful for our position on the charts.

5405379	A (S-train)	A is a service on the S-train network in Copenhagen. It is one of the base services on the network, running every 20 minutes from about 5:00 to 0:30 every day, and every 10 minutes from about 6:15 to 19:00. It runs between Hundige and Hillerød, serving all stations on the inner part of the Køge radial. During daytime on weekdays, every second train continues from Hundige station to Solrød Strand station. On Friday and Saturday nights there is also a 30 minutes service throughout the night. ==History== Since the first part of the Køge radial opened in 1972, letter A has been used for the principal service on its inner part. Before that time the most constant characteristic of service A was that it ran on the Klampenborg radial in the northern end of the system. Name Southern end Years Northern end 1a all stops to Valby 1934–1940 Klampenborgbanen: all stops to Klampenborg 1a terminated at København H 1940–1950 Klampenborgbanen: all stops to Klampenborg A Frederikssundbanen: all stops to Vanløse 1950–1952 Klampenborgbanen: all stops to Klampenborg A as above, extended to Herlev in rush hours 1952–1972 Klampenborgbanen: all stops to Klampenborg A Køgebugtbanen: all stops to Vallensbæk 1972–1976 Klampenborgbanen: all stops to Klampenborg A all stops to Hundige 1976–1979 Klampenborgbanen: all stops to Klampenborg A all stops to Hundige; extended to Solrød Strand evenings and weekends 1979–1983 Nordbanen: all stops to Holte A all stops to Hundige 1983–1989 Nordbanen: all stops to Holte A all stops to Hundige 1989–1999 Nordbanen: to Hillerød, non-stop Østerport-Hellerup-Lyngby-Holte A all stops to Hundige 1999–2007 as above except all stops until Hellerup A all stops to Hundige 2007–2009 Hareskovbanen: all stops to Farum A all stops to Hundige; some daytime trains to Solrød Strand Dec 2009–2014 Hareskovbanen: all stops to Farum A all stops to Hundige; some daytime trains to Solrød Strand 2014– Nordbanen: non-stop Hellerup-Jægersborg, all stops to Hillerød ===Ax, K, A+=== Until 2007, separate service designations were used for trains that reinforced the basic service on the Køge radial in high-traffic periods. This was in part because they had their own stopping patterns, and in part due to the then-current doctrine that a service letter such as A must not be used for more than exactly 3 trains an hour. The first supplementary service was the rush-hour Ax which started running when the first phase of the Køge radial opened in 1972. It was upgraded to the daytime K service in 1992 and quickly renamed to A+ in 1993.

41801556	A (The Walking Dead)	"A" is the sixteenth and final episode of the fourth season of the post- apocalyptic horror television series The Walking Dead, which aired on AMC on March 30, 2014. The episode was written by Scott M. Gimple and Angela Kang, and directed by Michelle MacLaren. As multiple paths collide on each group's travels, Rick (Andrew Lincoln) remembers the past and comes face to face with sheer brutality. As the so-called sanctuary, "Terminus", begins to reveal its true face, the group struggles to survive. Themes explored in this episode include preparedness and the extremities of living in a lawless world. The latter is explored through Rick's guilt and trauma after being forced to brutally murder two men to protect his son, Carl (Chandler Riggs). ==Plot== Flashbacks through the episode take place during the groups' time at the prison. Over an undetermined period, Hershel helps Rick to recognize that he has taken a violent, callous attitude toward protecting his group, and reminds him of how this has impressed on his son Carl, nor allowed himself to spend time with his infant daughter Judith. Rick comes to take Hershel's advice, deciding to put down his gun, take up farming alongside Carl, and enjoy time with the members of his group. In the present, Rick, Carl, and Michonne follow signs along the tracks to Terminus. They hear cries for help and find a lone survivor surrounded by walkers. Rick warns them about conserving their ammunition and determines there is too much to risk in saving the man, and they watch him get killed by the walkers. That night, they are ambushed by Joe and his gang of Claimers, whose number also includes the reluctant Daryl. Joe had been tracking Rick's group for some time, seeking revenge on Rick for killing one of his own. Joe holds Rick at gunpoint, and Daryl (who was unaware it was Rick's group being tracked) tries to convince Joe to not harm his friends. Joe refuses Daryl and has two of his men secure him before turning his attention back to Rick. Joe says that the Claimers are "reasonable men", but in revenge, he will have Daryl beaten to death, sexually assault Michonne, then Carl, and then kill Rick after he is forced to witness this. One Claimer, Dan, prepares to rape Carl. Instinctively, Rick headbutts Joe, who fires his gun but misses, but the shot leaves Rick temporarily deaf. Joe wrestles and secures Rick, but Rick then bites into Joe's carotid artery and rips out his jugular vein, killing him and shocking the other Claimers. Daryl and Michonne use the moment to break free of their captors, killing the rest of the Claimers except Dan. Dan pleads for his life, but Rick stabs him with Joe's pocketknife and disembowels him, and then continues to stab him to death repeatedly, as Carl watches. Rick makes sure the others are safe, and he and Daryl reconcile, and Daryl explains that he got separated from Beth and is unaware of her fate. Later, the four continue toward Terminus and soon come in sight of the train yard. Rick is concerned and decides to bury most of their weapons nearby before they enter. They are greeted at Terminus by brothers Gareth (Andrew J. West) and Alex (Tate Ellington), and they check their weapons before returning them to the group. Alex provides them with a tour of Terminus, providing them with food from their mother Mary. Rick notices inside Alex’s cargo pants pocket the silver chain of the pocketwatch that Hershel had given to Glenn as his sign of approval for marrying his daughter Maggie. Rick takes Alex at gunpoint and demands to know where he found the pocket watch. Gareth, observing from a distance, orders his men to attack, starting a large firefight. Rick uses Alex as a bullet shield, before he and the others are forced into a series of alleyways, and eventually into a closed-in area, where they have nowhere to hide from snipers. Gareth demands they drop their weapons, and the group is escorted into a boxcar where they find that the Terminus residents have already captured Glenn, Maggie, Bob, and Sasha, along with new allies Abraham, Rosita, Eugene, and Tara. When they are locked in, Rick tells the others "they're screwing with the wrong people." ==Production== "A" was co-written by executive producer and showrunner Scott M. Gimple and producer Angela Kang; it was each their third writing credit for the season. It was directed by Michelle MacLaren, who previously directed season two's "Pretty Much Dead Already" and season one's "Guts". It marks the final episode to feature Hershel Greene, although in a flashback sequence, following the character's death in "Too Far Gone". For this episode, Scott Wilson is readded to the opening credits after being removed after the ninth episode of the season. The episode marks the final appearance of recurring character Joe (played by Jeff Kober) as he was killed by Rick Grimes by biting out his jugular vein. The scene where Rick, Michonne and Carl are captured by Joe's gang was intentionally shot and produced to follow a certain portion of the plotline in "Volume 10", "Issue #57" of the comic book series. The main difference is in the comics, Rick, Carl, and Abraham are captured by three bandits, whereas in the show, Rick, Carl, and Michonne are captured by Joe's gang of five men. During filming of the final scene, Andrew Lincoln remarked that he delivered the final line which was very close to the one found in "Volume #11", "Issue #64" of the comic book series. Scott Gimple noted that this would never have passed the network censors, so they had to re-take another version of the final scene without the swearing. Despite this, the scene with the swearing is considered the canonical version. The home video release of the episode shows the uncensored version of the final line of the season, "They're fucking with the wrong people." ==Reception== ===Viewership=== Upon airing, the episode was watched by 15.68 million American viewers, and received an 18–49 rating of 8.0. This marks a rise in total viewers and ratings from the previous episode, which received an 18–49 rating of 6.7 and 13.47 million viewers. This rating represents the season finale high to date, but below the all-time high of the season four premiere episode. Overall, season four's average viewership of 13.3 million viewers was an increase of 20% over season three. ===Critical reception=== The episode received critical acclaim. Writing for Forbes, Allen St. John, commented the finale positively, saying, "This episode, directed masterfully by Michelle McLaren of Breaking Bad fame, puts The Walking Dead in an interesting place. The story line takes our heroes into a dark place—and what can be darker than a locked railroad car?" IGN's Roth Cornet rated the episode a "Great" 8.0, writing, "The Walking Dead Season 4 finale served as a response to a question Rick has been asking himself nearly since the start of the series: What kind of man am I? The answer, at least to some degree, is whatever kind of man the moment demands of him; which is exactly what he’d need to be in order to make a strong and viable leader in this world. While I do feel that the conclusion could have been stronger, this was one of the most well-directed and executed episodes of the latter half of this season." ==References== ==External links== *"A" at AMC * Category:2014 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 4) episodes Category:Television episodes directed by Michelle MacLaren

62120562	A (a Minor) v Minister for Justice and Equality and others	A (a Minor) v Minister for Justice and Equality, Refugee Applications Commissioner, Ireland and the Attorney General [2013 IESC 18, (2013) 2 ILRM 457] is an Irish Supreme Court case where the Supreme Court concluded that a certificate of leave to appeal was not required in order to appeal to the Supreme Court a decision of the High Court to dismiss proceedings as frivolous or vexatious. == Background == This case involved a child "A", suing by her mother and next friend (the appellant). The appellant was born in Ireland in 2010 and was the child of a Nigerian national, who came to Ireland in 2005. The appellant applied for asylum in Ireland, which application was rejected by the Refugee Applications Commissioner in July 2011. The application for asylum was rejected on the basis that:The appellant (through her mother) sought judicial review of the Refugee Applications Commissioner's decision to refuse the asylum application. As part of this application, the appellant sought a number of reliefs - "including an order quashing the decision of the [Refugee Applications] Commissioner that the appellant failed to establish a well founded fear of persecution as defined under s.2 of the Refugee Act, 1996, as amended." The Minister for Justice and Equality, Refugee Applications Commissioner, Ireland and the Attorney General (the respondents) sought an order dismissing the proceedings of the appellant "on the grounds that they were frivolous, and/or vexatious, and/or doomed to fail, and/or an abuse of the process." The High Court agreed with the respondents. The High Court agreed with the Refugee Applications Commissioner's reasoning for denying asylum and found that there was no need for judicial review in this instance and that a motion of appeal against the Refugee Applications Commissioners report would be more appropriate. As the High Court noted, "the generalised grounds, divorced from any specific flaws in a challenged decision, raise a prima facie implication that the judicial review proceeding had been commenced as a delaying tactic only." The appellant appealed against, and sought an order setting aside, the High Court judgment and order dismissing the proceedings as "frivolous, and/or vexatious, and/or doomed to fail, and/or an abuse of the process". The respondents sought to have the appeal struck out on the basis that the appellant had not obtained a certificate of leave to appeal from the High Court - this certificate was, according to the respondents, required under s5(3)(a) Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000. == Holding of the Supreme Court == The written judgment was provided by Denham CJ , with whom Murray J and Clarke J concurred. S5(3)(a) Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 provides that: The question for the court was, therefore, whether the order of the High Court dismissing the proceedings was a "determination of the High Court of an application for leave to apply for judicial review" in respect of which a certificate of leave to appeal was required. The Supreme Court granted an appeal without the need for a certificate. The appellant's application for leave to apply for judicial review had not been heard by the High Court. The High Court's decision was, rather, based on the respondent's motion to quash an application for judicial review. The High Court's ruling was not, therefore, a 'determination' within the meaning of s5(3)(a) Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000. The Court relied on the reasoning of Geoghegan J in B. v Minister for Justice, Equality & Law Reform where Geoghegan J noted that: Applying this reasoning to the present case, Denham CJ noted "[t]he issues involved in a motion to dismiss may be substantially different from those involved in an application for leave to apply for judicial review". She went on to note that the wording of s5(3)(a) Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 did not ouster the right of appeal. The court concluded that the appellant could bring an appeal without the need for a certificate of the High Court. == External links == A (a Minor) v Minister for Justice ==References== Category:2013 in case law Category:2013 in Irish law Category:2013 in the Republic of Ireland Category:Supreme Court of Ireland cases Category:Immigration case law
552462	A (band)	A are a British alternative rock band from Suffolk, England, which formed in 1993. They have released 4 studio and 2 live albums, including their debut How Ace Are Buildings and the UK top 20 album Hi-Fi Serious. Single releases have also achieved strong chart success, with a UK top 10, four UK top 40 and seven UK Top 100 singles. Shortly after releasing their fourth album, Teen Dance Ordinance, in 2005, the band briefly split. In 2007 'A' reunited for a one-off gig, and have been touring sporadically ever since including playing the main stage at Download Pilot on June 19, 2021. They have not released any further albums since 2005. ==History== === Formation, How Ace Are Buildings and A vs. Monkey Kong (1993–2000) === The band began in Suffolk in the mid 80s as Grand Designs, named after the song by Rush. The founder members were twins Jason and Adam Perry and their friend Mark Chapman, with bassist Stevie Swindon and the twins' younger brother Giles Perry. They cited Rush, the Beach Boys, Van Halen and the Beastie Boys among their influences. After changing their name to A in 1993, and abandoning their early progressive rock-inspired sound for a more punk rock style, they signed a European recording contract with Warner Bros. Records UK in 1996 and released their debut LP How Ace Are Buildings in 1997. Also in 1997, the band briefly appeared in the music video for "Anthem" by the Wildhearts. A found a healthy underground reception and even had a couple of low-charting singles in the UK. Although A achieved some recognition with How Ace Are Buildings, bassist Stevie Swindon left the band. He was replaced in 1997 by bassist and future BBC Radio 1 Rock Show DJ Daniel P Carter. Swindon went on to establish the award-winning community arts charity, TAPE Community Music and Film in 2008. A licensing agreement for the American music market was reached with the North Carolina-based Mammoth Records. Future releases would be distributed in the U.S. and Canada by Mammoth. A's second album A vs. Monkey Kong followed in 1999. The band then toured the world and enjoyed a small degree of success worldwide, especially in Germany. They released a live album, Exit Stage Right in 2000. ===Hi-Fi Serious and commercial success (2002) === Hi-Fi Serious was their third album, released in 2002 and is certified Silver in the UK having sold over 60,000 copies. It was preceded by their biggest single "Nothing", which became the band's first and only top ten hit when it reached number 9 in the UK singles chart. "Nothing" was followed by top 20 hit "Starbucks", named after the coffee chain. The tour following Hi-Fi Serious saw the band playing their largest venues to date, headlining the 5,000 capacity Brixton Academy as part of their Inner-City Sumo Tour. At the end of the year they won the Kerrang! award for Best British Band. In 2004, their single "Nothing" appeared on Beyblade's Let It Rip! official soundtrack. In 2007, "Something's Going On" and "The Distance" appeared on the Surf's Up video game soundtrack. ===Teen Dance Ordinance and hiatus (2005) === A released their fourth album, Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO), on 27 June 2005. The album had been recorded two years earlier, but was heavily delayed due to Jason Perry's illness and disputes with the record company. It featured a more straight rock sound and displayed an almost complete absence of the keyboards and sampling that marked the early sound of the band. Unlike their last two albums, Teen Dance Ordinance was not released in the US. Hollywood Records agreed early on to release it in the US, but ultimately did not. Following the release of Teen Dance Ordinance in 2005, the band worked on other projects. Jason Perry spent time writing, recording, and touring with Matt Willis, formerly of Busted, and has now become a Grammy award winning producer, working with the likes of the Blackout, Kids in Glass Houses, and McFly. Adam Perry and Daniel P Carter briefly became full-time members of the Bloodhound Gang: Perry replaced drummer Willie the New Guy in 2005, and Carter replaced guitarist Lupus Thunder in 2009. Carter continued writing material with Jason Perry and artists such as McFly, and has hosted BBC Radio 1's Rock Show since 25 September 2006. Mark Chapman went into teaching, and has played in the bands Malpractice, alongside drum'n'bass producer Adam F, and 'MiLLS,' fronted by former Cable drummer Richie Mills. Giles Perry went on work for the BBC, and has also produced videos for Hundred Reasons and Biffy Clyro. ===Reunion (2007–2008) === In August 2008, Adam Perry revealed six tour dates supporting the Wildhearts on the band's forum, noting that: "This is going to be wicked and we are grateful to the Wildhearts for dragging us from our retirement! Plus there are now big plans afoot to start the new record for next year." Bassist Daniel P Carter did not return to the band, however, and John Mitchell, front man of It Bites and producer of bands including Enter Shikari and Funeral for a Friend, filled in for the tour. === Later work (2009 – present) === 'A' played a 10-date UK tour in December 2009, supported by This City. On 13 May 2010, Bowling For Soup singer Jaret Reddick announced 'A' as support band for their Autumn tour. 'A' then announced on their own Twitter on 26 May 2010 that Daniel P. Carter would be returning to the band for this tour. Later that year, Perry and Carter were credited as co- writers of the Subways song "I Wanna Dance With You" from the album Money & Celebrity. 'A' played a one-off show at the Kasbah nightclub in Coventry on 1 December 2012. In June 2015, they played warm-up concerts in St Albans and Royal Tunbridge Wells before headlining the 4th stage at that year's Download Festival. Andrew "Shay" Sheehy, formerly of Kids in Glass Houses, filled in on bass guitar for these shows. In February 2018, 'A' embarked on an 8 date UK tour in support of Hell Is for Heroes, joined briefly by McFly bassist Dougie Poynter. and an appearance at Download Festival. In November 2018, the band went on a 9 date tour playing the album Hi-Fi Serious in full, with support from Wheatus and InMe followed by another UK headline tour and appearances at Two Thousand Trees Festival and Camden Rocks in summer 2019. In November 2019, 'A' band played eight dates in the UK to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the album A vs. Monkey Kong. The band were joined by Tim HB, formally of Architects (British band) who stepped in on bass guitar for the tour. Support was provided by '68. During 2021 'A' performed on the main stage at the Download Festival Pilot event and the rescheduled Slam Dunk Festival. In April 2022 the band played a warm-up show in Dover before heading out around the UK on 11 dates as main support for Reef. 2023 has seen fresh rumors of new "A" material. ==Members== Current members * Jason Perry – lead vocals (1993–2005, 2008–present) * Adam Perry – drums (1993–2005, 2008–present) * Giles Perry – keyboards, backing vocals (1993–2005, 2008–present) * Mark Chapman – guitar (1993–2005, 2008–present) Former members * Steve Swindon – bass guitar (1993–1997) * Daniel P.

The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Glossary, pp. 119-145, mû, p. 132. "water", which is used in the Gilgamesh flood myth, Chapter XI of the Epic, or other passages. The sign is also used extensively in the Amarna letters. Cuneiform a is the most common of the four vowels in the Akkadian language, a, e, i, and u. All vowels can be interchangeable, depending on the scribe, though spellings of Akkadian words in dictionaries, will be formalized, and typically: unstressed, a 'long- vowel', or thirdly, a 'combined' vowel (often spelled with two signs (same vowel, ending the first sign, and starting the next sign), thus combined into the single vowel, â, ê, î, or û.). Cuneiform a is the most common of the four vowels, as can be shown by usage in the Epic of Gilgamesh, the usage numbers being (ú (u, no. 2) is more common than u, (no. 1), which has additional usages, numeral "10", and "and", "but", etc.): a-(1369), e-(327), i-(698), ú-(493). (For u, only: u-(166));Parpola, 1971. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Sign List, pp. 155-165, Signs a, e, i, ú, and u. The usage for a, includes the usage for Akkadian a-na, (ana),Parpola, 1971. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Glossary, pp. 119-145, ana, pp. 120-121. the preposition, "for", "to", etc., about 250 usages (therefore usage: 1369–250). ==I-ligatured-a, as "ia", (iYa)== The combined vowel i, 100x24px, connected (ligatured, attached to a) 100x24px, ligatured to cuneiform a is the ia (cuneiform) 100x24px. It has usages in the Akkadian language for words starting with "ia", for example "iā'u", (English "mine"), "iāši", (English "(to) me"), and "iāti", (English "me"). In the Amarna letters ia is also used as a suffix: -ia, for example Amarna letter EA 325, "To King (Pharaoh)-Lord- mine (-ia), God-mine, Sun-God-mine, ...." ("A-na Lugal-bēlu-ia, An-meš-ia, An- UTU-ia, ....") ==Amarna letter usage== The Amarna letter usage of cuneiform a has the same high usage for Akkadian language ana (a-na) as does the Epic of Gilgamesh. Two other high usages for a and typical to the Amarna letters is the negative: lā, Akkadian language, "lā", used before the spelling of the verb, which follows. In the Epic of Gilgamesh it almost exclusively is spelled just lā, without the extra a. The opposite is true for the Amarna letters, which has it spelled almost exclusively la-a, (for "lā") thus making it very easy to find and read in the letters, and thus the verb usually follows. ===Akkadian "enūma", "eninna", often a segue=== Because the Amarna letters often state the condition of events in the regions where the letters originate, the events are often previewed by Now..., or When..., which are topical segues. They sometimes start new paragraphs. At a minimum, they simply continue the text, as 'seque transition points'. (Some letters, EA 19, Para 2, also include spaces, as part of the segue.) The segue word: Akkadian language "enūma",Parpola, 1971. The Standard Babylonian Epic of Gilgamesh, Glossary, pp. 119-145, enûma, p. 124. (English "when") is only used three times in the Epic of Gilgamesh, as opposed to the Amarna letters where it is used hundreds of times (reverse side of EA 362, 7 times, lines 33–68, mostly spelled "inûma"). In the Amarna letters, Akkadaian enūma is used and spelled starting with either i, e, or a, thus inūma, enūma, or anūma, all for Akkadian language "enūma". The usage is probably specific to the scribe, as the writer of the letter (not necessarily the 'author' of the letter). Akkadian language "eninna", (English "now") is used far less in the Amarna letters. Anūma, enūma, and inūma is the common adverb, for now, or when, (now, ("now, at this time", as the segue)). ==References== *Moran, William L. 1987, 1992. The Amarna Letters.

2828410	A (musical note)	A or La is the sixth note and the tenth semitone of the fixed-do solfège. Its enharmonic equivalents are B (B double flat) which is a diatonic semitone above A and G (G double sharp) which is a diatonic semitone below A. "A" is generally used as a standard for tuning. When the orchestra tunes, the oboe plays an "A" and the rest of the instruments tune to match that pitch. Every string instrument in the orchestra has an A string, from which each player can tune the rest of their instrument. "A" is also used in combination with a number (e.g. A-440) to label the pitch standard. The number designates the frequency in hertz. A lower number equals a lower pitch. The International Standards Organization (ISO) has standardized the pitch at A-440. However, tuning has varied over time, geographical region, or instrument maker. In 17th-century Europe, tunings ranged from about A-374 to A-403, approximately two to three semitones below A-440. Historical examples exist of instruments, tuning forks, or standards ranging from A-309 to A-455.3, a difference of almost six semitones. Although the official standard today is A-440, some orchestral groups and chamber groups prefer to tune a little higher, at A-442 or even A-444. Baroque pitch is usually cited as A-415, which is a semitone lower than modern pitch. A0 is the lowest note on the standard piano. The octaves follow A1, A2, etc. A7 is a few pitches lower than C8, the highest note on the standard piano. The note "A" is not considered to be a certain milestone or mark to hit with voice as, for example, Tenor C is, but it can be extremely demanding in certain octaves. ==Designation by octave== Scientific designation Helmholtz designation Octave name Frequency (Hz) Sound sample A−1 A͵͵͵ or ͵͵͵A or AAAA Subsubcontra 13.75 A0 A͵͵ or ͵͵A or AAA Subcontra 27.5 A1 A͵ or ͵A or AA Contra 55 55 Sine wave A2 A Great 110 110 Sine wave A3 a Small 220 220 Sine wave A4 a One-lined 440 440 Sine wave A5 a Two-lined 880 880 Sine wave A6 a Three-lined 1760 1760 Sine wave A7 a Four- lined 3520 A8 a Five-lined 7040 A9 a Six-lined 14080 A10 a Seven-lined 28160 ==Scales== ===Common scales beginning on A=== * A major: A B C D E F G A *A natural minor: A B C D E F G A * A harmonic minor: A B C D E F G A * A melodic minor ascending: A B C D E F G A * A melodic minor descending: A G F E D C B A ===Diatonic scales=== * A Ionian: A B C D E F G A * A Dorian: A B C D E F G A * A Phrygian: A B C D E F G A * A Lydian: A B C D E F G A * A Mixolydian: A B C D E F G A * A Aeolian: A B C D E F G A * A Locrian: A B C D E F G A ===Jazz melodic minor=== * A Ascending melodic minor: A B C D E F G A * A Dorian ♭2: A B C D E F G A * A Lydian augmented: A B C D E F G A * A Lydian dominant: A B C D E F G A * A Mixolydian ♭6: A B C D E F G A * A Locrian ♮2: A B C D E F G A * A Altered: A B C D E F G A ==See also== * Piano key frequencies * A major * A minor * Root (chord) ==References== ==External links== * Standard Pitch or Concert Pitch for Pianos by Barrie Heaton * Virginia Tech Music Dictionary: A Category:Musical notes

50148834	A + No Poder	A + No Poder (English: "To the Max") is the fourteenth studio album by Mexican recording artist Alejandra Guzmán. It was released on September 11, 2015, by Sony Music Latin. After the success of her previous live album, Primera Fila (2013) and its promotional tour, Guzmán recorded the album with original songs, composed and produced by her and Argentinian musician José Luis Pagán. After its release, A + No Poder received favorable reviews from music critics, with one expressing appreciation for the balance between ballads and rock songs. The record peaked at number twelve on the US Billboard Latin Pop Albums and number six in Mexico. To promote the album, three singles were released: "Adiós" featuring reggaeton performer Farruko, which peaked at number 26 on the Billboard Latin Pop Songs chart, "Qué Ironía" and "Esta Noche". ==Background== In 2013, Alejandra Guzmán released her fourth live album titled Primera Fila, selling 90,000 units in Mexico and launching the "La Guzman 1F Tour", which included dates in cities of the United States such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Houston, Miami and also Puerto Rico. Two years later, Guzmán entered the recording studio to record A + No Poder, which would become her first studio album in over five years. The album's songs were written by Guzmán and Argentinian musician José Luis Pagán. The singer stated that the album "reflects maturity and growth that has also regains my rock essence since I was pigeonholed as a balladeer but not at all, that is what I am." A + No Poder is Guzmán's first studio album since Único (2009), a critically acclaimed effort that was commercial unsuccessful due to lack of promotion, according to Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo. ==Content== A + No Poder is dedicated to Guzmán's daughter Frida Sofia.Alejandra Guzmán, A + No Poder (Liner Notes). Sony Music. (2015) The album includes twelve tracks: eleven written by Guzmán and Pagán, with additional writers for three of them. "Adiós" was co-written by Carlos Efrén Reyes, "Esta Noche" was co-written by Karenka and Reyli Barba, and "A Más No Poder" was co-written Sarah Lenore. Another track, "Una Canción de Amor", was entirely written by Argentinean singer-songwriter Alejandro Lerner. "Adiós" features Puerto-Rican reggaeton performer Farruko. "Te Esperaré" is a ballad, and "Malvada", a story about a femme fatale, has country music undertones with a harmonica that resembles Mexican band El Tri. "Malvada" and "This is Too Much Rock and Roll" are rock songs, with the latter reminds of Soy, an album released by the singer in 2001. "Esta Noche" is a pop/funk track with reggae influences. "A Más No Poder" has sexual connotations in its lyrics and as stated by Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo, "brings back memories when Guzmán was produced by Miguel Blasco in the 90's". "Mi Debilidad" is a pop/rock song, while "No Puedo Parar" is a heavy metal track. "Qué Ironía" is a rock ballad that recalls Guzmán greatest hits such as "Mi Peor Error". About the songs included, Guzmán stated to Tabasco Hoy: "In recent years I experienced many good and bad things, so I thought, why not transform them into songs. And so it began to take shape this new album, which I think is more intelligent, mature and planned than my previous work". ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== The album was met with positive reviews by music critics. Fabiola Hinojosa, of Televisa Espectáculos stated that the album "shows that despite being a rocker at heart, she has no problem recording in another genre and experiment[ing] with new rhythms." Hinojosa also praised the rock song "No Puedo Parar", arguing that "if someone who never before had heard another song from her would believe that she [Guzmán] only performs in the rock genre". Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo said that "Guzmán is back and wants to reclaim her place on the music market." Rodríguez also reminded that Guzmán keeps trying to incorporate new or alternative rhythms to her music even if the results are not commercially successful, such as her albums Cambio de Piel (1996) produced by Spanish musician Carlos Narea, or Lipstick (2004), helmed by American artist Desmond Child, and A + No Poder is no exception, since the "Queen of Rock in Mexico" includes songs that "hark back to the era of the nineties, but so potentiated with harder songs where the guitars, drums and her hoarse voice come together in musical chords." Alex Alexdy of Hey Espectáculos referred to this album as a "well balance between rock and pop" that shows Guzmán's excentric side who opted for a rock album with some ballads and new rhythms such as reggaeton. ===Commercial reception=== A + No Poder peaked at number 12 in the Billboard Latin Pop Albums component chart in the United States, one of her worst placements in the chart, only Lipstick (2004) and Fuerza (2007) have reached lower numbers, at 15 and 16, respectively. In Mexico, the album peaked at number six in the Mexican Albums Chart. ==Singles== To promote the album, Guzmán released three singles. Lead single "Adiós" was released on June 5, 2015, and features guest vocals from Farruko. The track peaked at number 26 in the Billboard Latin Pop Songs and 17 in the Latin Rhythm Airplay charts, respectively, in the United States and at 15 on the Mexican Espanol Airplay chart. According to Alex Alexdy of Hey Espectáculos, the song was not a success since it is not good enough to compete with other 'reggaeton' songs and "it is far from the ballads that are surefire hits for Guzmán." The music video for the second single, "Qué Ironía", was filmed on Iceland and released on September 12, 2015. To further promote the album, the track "Esta Noche" was used as the main theme of the Mexican TV show Parodiando: Noches de Traje, and was later released as the third single on May 27, 2016, with a music video filmed on Campeche, Mexico. ==Track listing== == Credits == Credits adapted from AllMusic. *Robert Arthur – acoustic guitar *Gustavo Borner – mastering, mixing *Pat Coil – Hammond organ *Farruko – featured artist *Manny Galvez – assistant engineer *Alejandra Guzmán – direction, primary artist, realization *Brendan Harkin – recording *Jim Hoke – harmonica *Chris Latham – recording *Matt Laug – drums *Sarah Lenore – background vocals *Guillermo Gutiérrez Leyva – A&R; *Chris McDonald – string arrangements *Teddy Mulet – trombone, trumpet *Craig Nelson – upright bass *Quique Ollervides – artist, design *Azucena Olvera – A&R; *José Luis Pagán – arrangement, bass, background vocals, direction, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, keyboard programming, production, recording, string arrangements *Saverio Principini – bass guitar, recording *Gabriel Saientz – piano *Doug Sarrett – recording *Marco Sonzini – recording *Sharo Torres – keyboards, recording, rhythm programming *Kameron Williams – MC ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2015) Peak position Mexican Albums Chart (AMPROFON) 6 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2015) Position Mexican Albums Chart 93 ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Alejandra Guzmán albums Category:RCA Records albums Category:Sony Music albums Category:Spanish-language albums

She is so upset about the theft of her bank that the parents decide to inform the police. They go to the police station and report the robbery, but the police laugh at them.

So she gets a police whistle and starts investigating on her own, eventually finding the thief. == Cast == *Marie Eline as Edna Robinson *Grace Eline == Production == The director of the film is not known for certain, but two Thanhouser directors are possible. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The American Film Institute credits Barry O'Neil as the director. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production, but he does credit Blair Smith as the cameraman.

13491239	A 44-Calibre Mystery	A 44-Calibre Mystery is a 1917 American short Western film, featuring Harry Carey. Carey plays the role of Sheriff Cheyenne Harry. He saves Kitty Flanders from Pete McGuire and takes her safely home. McGuire hides in a shack on Mr. Flanders' stake and Harry's deputy is shot dead, apparently by Mr. Flanders. McGuire offers to keep quiet about the murder if Flanders gives him half a stake and his daughter's hand in marriage. Mr. Flanders confesses his crime to Sheriff Harry and learns that he is innocent. Sheriff Harry notices McGuire's gun and accuses him of the crime, but they are killed as they try to escape. The film concludes as Kitty Flanders confesses her love to Sheriff Cheyenne as she bandages his wounds from the fight. Originally released in 1917, the film was later revised and re-titled as Sure-Shot Morgan and possibly released in 1919, and also re-released under both names in 1922. The film garnered little critic attention and the first summary of the film came from the two-reel revised release with a positive review. The film was directed by Fred Kelsey and released by Universal Film Manufacturing Company. The film's status is unknown. ==Plot== Set in the town of Driftwood, the film begins when Pete McGuire, known by the alias "Lone Jack" arrives in town and molests Kitty Flanders. Sheriff Cheyenne Harry intervenes and knocks down McGuire and takes Kitty Flanders to her home. McGuire becomes aware that Sheriff Harry's deputy, Horton, is out to arrest him and McGuire hides out on a shack on Flanders' claim. Horton is later killed, apparently by Mr. Flanders, and McGuire offers to keep quiet in exchange that he gives him half a stake in the claim and have Kitty Flanders marry him. Later, Sheriff Harry learns that Horton was killed by a 44-Calibre round. Mr. Flanders confesses to Sheriff Harry that he shot and killed Horton, but the sheriff points out that his gun was of a different size. Sheriff Harry notices that McGuire's gun is a 44-Calibre and accuses him of killing Horton. McGuire and an accomplice attempt to escape, but are killed by the Sheriff in a fight. Kitty Flanders confesses her love to Sheriff Cheyenne as she bandages his wounds. ==Cast== * Harry Carey as Sheriff Cheyenne Harry * Claire Du Brey as Kitty Flanders * Hoot Gibson * Frank MacQuarrie * Vester Pegg * William Steele credited as William Gettinger (Bill Gettinger) * Maude Emory ==Production and release== The screen story originates from T. Shelley Sutton and was adapted to the scenario by Charles J. Wilson. However, Exhibitor's Trade Review states that while Shelley Sutton wrote the film, the scenario was instead adapted by F. A. Meredith. The film was directed by Fred Kelsey. The Universal Film Manufacturing Company released the film on May 22, 1917, using the standard 35 mm spherical 1.37:1 format. The three reel film was marketed by Universal under the "Gold Seal" label and was advertised as a higher quality work that had a higher cost than other productions in return for bolstering the returns of a weak feature or show by drawing additional patrons. The Silent Film Era website states that this film was edited down to two-reels and was re-released as Sure-Shot Morgan on September 4, 1922, and/or October 28, 1922. The April 1923 Motion Picture News Booking Guide states that Sure-Shot Morgan was released on September 4, 1922. However, an earlier reference exists for Sure-Shot Morgan as a Universal Special Attraction released on February 1, 1919. This mention also includes the note that the film was already in a two-reel state and stars Harry Carey. A newspaper record for a "Sure-Shot Morgan" appears on February 1, 1919, in The Wichita Daily Eagle, but lacks further details. The next mention in a newspaper is in The Wilmington Morning Star on February 8, 1919, and attributes the star of Sure-Shot Morgan as Neal Burns and in another ad on the same page as Neal Hart. Despite the conflicting information, the next newspaper mentions of Sure-Shot Morgan occurs after the 1922 release date and notes again that Harry Carey stars in the film. The revision down to two reels was kept for the re-release of A 44-Calibre Mystery. The film did not receive a much attention and the first summary of the plot occurred after its revision. Critical reception of the film and its analysis was scarce in publications. In 1922, the Exhibitors Trade Review said the two-reel reissue of A 44-Calibre Mystery is "good in spite of or perhaps because of the fact that it really is 'wild and wooley' as well." The original 1917 production was also said to be popular with fans of western melodramas. The film's status is unknown, but it is presumably among the 90% of all American silent films that are lost. ==See also== * Harry Carey filmography * Hoot Gibson filmography ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:1917 films Category:1917 Western (genre) films Category:1917 short films Category:American silent short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films directed by Fred Kelsey Category:Silent American Western (genre) films Category:Universal Pictures short films Category:1910s American films Category:1910s English-language films
54187039	A A Dhand	A A Dhand (Amit Dhand) is a British-Asian crime-writer. His recent books are set in the West Yorkshire city of Bradford, a former industrial city very much a shadow of its former self and rife with social deprivation, crime and complex inter-communal challenges. ==Background== Raised in Bradford and the son of an immigrant corner shop owner. He attended the prestigious Fulneck Boarding School in Leeds (of which features in his novels). He originally trained as a pharmacist and worked in London, but returned to his home town to start a pharmacy business and write books. He is now a regular contributor to a number of British Asian and crime writers' fora. ==Writing== Dhand's first novel featured a character Ranjit Singh and is set against the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947; but it has been his more recent novels that have won him critical acclaim. These have featured the Bradford-based police detective Harry Virdee, a progressive British Sikh who struggles with his cultural identity and family loyalties. Race, violence and exploitation are on the agenda in the Virdee novels, and Dhand has not shied away from controversial issues of tension between British Asian communities and the controversy over such issues as the 'grooming' of vulnerable females by organised gangs of men. Dhand is fairly unique as he sets his protagonists (who are shaped by Asian culture) in a British setting. His novel Streets of Darkness is being developed as a TV drama. ==Bibliography== * Fields of Blood (2015) (featuring character Ranjit Singh) * Streets of Darkness (Bantam Press - 16 June 2016) (featuring character Harry Virdee) * Girl Zero (Bantam Press - 13 July 2017) (featuring character Harry Virdee) * City of Sinners (Bantam Press - 28 June 2018) (featuring character Harry Virdee) * One Way Out (Bantam Press - 27 June 2019) (featuring character Harry Virdee) ==References== ==External links== *A A Dhand’s Website * *Penguin Authors *A A Dhand Blog and Photography Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:English crime fiction writers Category:English thriller writers Category:English male novelists Category:Writers from Bradford

47880532	A Aa	A Aa is a 2016 Indian Telugu-language romantic comedy family film written and directed by Trivikram Srinivas and produced by S. Radha Krishna under Haarika & Hassine Creations. The film stars Nithiin, Samantha and Anupama Parameswaran. Mickey J Meyer composed the score and soundtrack. The film is loosely based on the novel Meena written by Yaddanapudi Sulochana Rani, which has earlier been adapted into the 1973 film Meena by Vijaya Nirmala, starring Krishna. The plot follows Anasuya Ramalingam, daughter of Mahalakshmi, a rich and strict businesswoman, who falls in love with her cousin, Anand, an ex-chef when she is sent to visit her aunt in a village. Launched officially in September 2015, the film's principal photography took place in October 2015 and ended in April 2016. The film was released on 2 June 2016, after multiple postponements. Samantha won several accolades including a Best Actress award at the 64th Filmfare Awards South and Best Performance in a Leading Role at the 2nd IIFA Utsavam Awards, for her portrayal as Anasuya Ramalingam. The film was successful at the box office, and stood as the eighth highest-grossing Telugu film of 2016. ==Plot== A Aa revolves around the lives of 23-year-old Anasuya Ramalingam and Anand Vihari and their families. Anand, a former chef, runs an e-foods business in Hyderabad. He belongs to a middle-class family with responsibilities to fulfill, like getting his sister Bhanumathi married and paying off debts (his father is dead). Anasuya is the daughter of a rich and strict mother named Mahalakshmi. Anasuya has never really got along with her mother, while being very close to her father, Ramalingam, who doesn't talk much against Mahalakshmi. When her mother goes on a business trip, her father Ramalingam sends her to visit her extended family in Kalavapudi village near Vijayawada to avoid a matchmaking for her. On the train ride there, she meets her cousin Aanand, whom her father asked to accompany her back to his home. While she happily discovers the joy of being at her maternal uncle's house in Kalavapudi, she and Anand playfully butt heads through a series of comical situations. But she also discovers that Anand is being coerced into to marrying a girl in the village, Nagavalli, due to Aanand's family being in debt to Nagavalli's father, Pallam Venkanna, and Nagavalli loving Anand. Anand is not interested, but unable to turn down the proposal from Nagavalli's father, he keeps deferring it using his sister Bhanu's marriage as an excuse. One day when Nagavalli comes to their house, she takes an instant disliking to Anasuya upon learning she is Anand's cousin. Anasuya decides to frustrate her further by acting close with Anand in front of her. An irked Nagavalli gets her father to call Anasuya's father and threatens to inform Mahalakshmi that Anasuya is currently in Kalavupudi. There is some backstory as to why Mahalakshmi doesn't like her brother's family - which is revealed later. Ramalingam resolves the situation, but Mahalakshmi's secretary eavesdropped on the phone call and decides to call her anyway. Ramalingam maintains his calm but quickly calls Anand and asks him to bring Anasuya back to the city before Mahalakshmi returns from Chennai. Aanand manages to convince Nagavalli to lend him a jeep, which she agrees to only because Anasuya is leaving the village, and gets her back home before her mother returns. Back at home, Anasuya now realises her love for Anand. However, Mahalakshmi has already arranged her marriage with a rich guy named Shekhar, which got intentionally canceled by Ramalingam in Anasuya's favor without revealing their identity. She defers meeting him twice, but eventually is forced to meet at a golf course. There, she accidentally hits the ball straight in his face and also injures the caddie. When Anu takes Shekar to the hospital, she runs into Anand and Bhanu. He reveals that his mother has been hospitalized after Pallam Venkanna ridiculed their family status and Bhanu's lack of marriage prospects in an attempt to make it seem like he was doing them a favour by allowing Anand to marry his daughter. Although Anasuya is happy to see Anand and Bhanu, she is saddened by this news. To make matters worse, she sees that Nagavalli and her father are also at the hospital. She then asks Anand if Bhanu can stay with her at her family's place as they became close friends during her time in Kalavupudi. Anand agrees but gives permission for only for a day. Anasuya brings her home and reveals to Mahalakshmi that Bhanu is Anand's sister. Mahalakshmi initially refuses to let Bhanu in but agrees later. She reveals that she had taken a loan from Anand's father(Mahalakshmi's brother), Krishnamoorthy, for business, and when she came to return the money, they had refused and closed the door on her face because Anand's father died. She warns Anasuya to be careful with Bhanu. Later that night Bhanu sees Shekhar's photo and says that he is good-looking. Anasuya again gets an idea, and next day, takes her to a mall and makes a deal with Bhanu. Bhanu had Anasuya help her ruin a proposal that came while she was staying with her, so now Anasuya says Bhanu owes her the same favour. As this plan unfolds, Shekar starts to fall in love with Bhanu. At one point, Shekar's grandfather mistakes Bhanu for Anasuya and even he agrees for their marriage. In the meantime, Anasuya finally confesses her feelings to Anand. But he reveals that Mahalakshmi delaying and then refusing to return the money she borrowed from his father all those years ago, was the reason for his father's death. Krishnamoorthy's properties and wealth that he had put as collateral for Mahalakshmi's business came up for auction after 4 years (Mahalakshmi promised to give it back in 2 years) and when he asked Mahalakshmi to give back the money, she refused and cited that it's not the end of the world for him if their ancestral land got auctioned off. Unable to take the humiliation in the village, Krishnamoorthy committed suicide before the auction took place, warning Anand in his suicide note to not sacrifice his happiness for other people's happiness. Anand also says Anasuya's father wasn't there for them when he was needed to stand up against her mother for what she was doing. He is unsure how both families will ever agree to their marriage. Mahalakshmi discovers that Shekhar loves Bhanu and not her daughter and locks her up. This angers Anasuya, who meets Anand and urges him to elope with her. He refuses, and this angers her more, and she starts walking aimlessly. She gets kidnapped by Pallam Venkanna's henchmen. Anand manages to save her, just in time for her engagement with Shekar and leaves with Bhanu. He reveals to Bhanu that he loves Anasuya, and she urges him to reveal the truth to Anasuya. He goes back to her engagement party and confesses his love, saying that he will keep her happy in any way she wants. Mahalakshmi demands Anand to let go of her daughter, but Anand confronts her for how she cheated his father out of the money she owed him. In the end, he leaves with Anasuya. When Anasuya and Anand reach his house, she is surprised to see her parents there. Her father reveals that as soon as Anasuya and Anand left, Mahalakshmi had a panic attack, but he managed to calm her down and get through to her about why they should let them be together. In the end, both families make amends for their past mistakes. Shekar also visits soon after to ask for Bhanu's hand in marriage. And lastly, Nagavalli seems to be coping with the fact that Anand isn't going to marry her...but she then says to her father that if the pair were to separate one day, Anand would return to her. == Cast == * Nithiin as Anand "Nandu" Vihari * Samantha Ruth Prabhu as Anasuya "Anu" Ramalingam * Ananya as Bhanumathi "Bhanu" Krishnamoorthy, Anand's sister * Anupama Parameswaran as Nagavalli "Valli" Venkanna's daughter, Anand's fiancée * Nadhiya as Mahalakshmi, Anu's mother * Naresh as Ramalingam, Anu's father * Rao Ramesh as Pallam Venkanna, Valli's father * Srinivas Avasarala as Shekar, Anu's former fiancée, and Bhanu's love interest * Easwari Rao as Kameshwari, Nandu's mother * Jayaprakash as Krishnamoorthy, Nandu's father * Hari Teja as Mangamma, Anu's househelp and personal assistant * Srinivasa Reddy as Gopal, Mahalakshmi's secretary * Ajay as Pallam Venkanna's son and Valli's brother * Posani Krishna Murali as Pallam Narayana, Pallam Venkanna's brother * Giri Babu as Banerjee, Shekar's grandfather * Shanoor Sana as Latha, Mahalakshmi's friend * Raghu Babu as Raghu, Latha's boyfriend * Praveen as Muthyam, Nandu's friend and labour * Shakalaka Shankar as Pratap, thief who wanted to steal in Nandu's house * Sri Sudha Bheemireddy as Anu's acting teacher * Annapoorna as Baby Mamma, an old woman in Nandu's village * Rajitha as Baby Mamma's relative * Karate Kalyani as Baby Mamma's relative * Heroshini Komali as Nandu's youngest sister * Chammak Chandra as Bhanu's former fiancée * Gundu Hanumantha Rao as Bhanu's former prospective father-in-law, (Chammak Chandra)'s father * Sivannarayana Naripeddi as a doctor ==Production== ===Development=== In August 2015, it was announced that Trivikram Srinivas will be directing a movie with Nithiin and Samantha, and S.

She is part of a secret society of children-protecting babysitters, and she calls the small monsters who carried off Jacob toadies. They go on a mission to find the boy, who has been kidnapped by the Boogeyman. Liz uses the infant she cares for to lure out the toadies, after tracking them down. However, the shiny object she offers it for Jacob doesn't tempt it as it normally would. The toadies deliver Jacob to the Boogeyman, who gleefully explains how he plans to collect an army of monsters, thanks to Jacob's ability to imagine a large variety of them. He sets up Jacob in a bed, hooks his head in a helmet designed to extract his nightmares, and tries to lull him to sleep. Meanwhile, after Liz returns the baby to her home, the girls go to Brown University to the Rhode Island Order of Babysitters headquarters.

Simultaneously both Curtis is concocting the Angel Hair potion while Kelly finds and breaks into the condemned lighthouse where Jacob is being held and the nightmares are starting to be extracted. The toadies try to cage Kelly, but she outwits them. A hypnotised Liz locks her up, but she uses a multi-functional tool from Curtis which knocks her down and snaps her back to normal. In the chamber where the nightmare creatures are about to be released by the Boogeyman, Kelly knocks the Angel Hair given to her by a SIT into him with a monster punch and an awakened Jacob dissipates the nightmare monsters.

4926209	A Bad Brains Reunion Live from Maritime Hall	A Bad Brains Reunion Live at Maritime Hall is the third live album from hardcore punk and reggae pioneers Bad Brains. It marks the reunion of the band after a four-year breakup. At the time, the band were unable to use the name "Bad Brains" as they were embattled in legal turmoil with their prior management company. For over three years, the band had to tour under the name "Soul Brains" even though the original lineup of Bad Brains was intact. The album came under sharp criticism upon its release due to the lazy singing style of the usually manic and energetic H.R., who was accused of mailing in his performance at this reunion concert recorded live in 1999 at the Maritime Hall theater in San Francisco. Moreover, many of the tracks had already appeared on the previous two live Bad Brains albums. One new song—"On Like Popcorn"—was also released as a single in preparation for a new studio album, but the band broke up once again in 2000. It was later included on their 2012 studio album Into the Future. ==Track listing== #"Attitude" – 1:43 #"Coptic Times" – 2:27 #"At the Movies" – 2:44 #"Right Brigade" – 2:36 #"Day Tripper"/"She's a Rainbow" – 5:52 #"Soulcraft" – 2:25 #"Tongue Tee Tie" – 3:08 #"Re-Ignition" – 6:47 #"Sailin' On"/"I & I Survive" – 8:52 #"House of Suffering " – 2:20 #"On Like Popcorn" – 3:20 #"Sacred Love" – 3:47 #"Youth Are Getting Restless" – 6:46 #"Pay to Cum" – 2:22 #"I Against I" – 3:12 ==Personnel== * H.R. – vocals * Dr. Know – guitar * Darryl Jenifer – bass * Earl Hudson – drums Category:Bad Brains live albums Category:1999 live albums
7446606	A Bad Case of Stripes	A Bad Case of Stripes is a children's book written and illustrated by David Shannon published in 1998 by Blue Sky Press, a division of Scholastic Press. A Bad Case of Stripes highlights the theme of being true to oneself and is commonly used by educators to teach young students important values. Amongst some negative response, this children’s book is also praised for its creativity, illustrations, and meaningful lessons. ==Plot summary== The main character is a girl named Camilla Cream who secretly loves lima beans. However, she refuses to eat them because her friends dislike them and Camilla wants to fit in. On the first day of school, she wakes up to discover thick, solid-colored stripes all over her body. The family's physician, Dr. Bumble, determines that Camilla is well enough to attend school tomorrow. But when she does the next day, most of the other children tease her and some of the other children call out colors and patterns which cause the colors on her skin to shift around. The principal sends her home as she is proving to be a distraction, and calls her parents to keep Camilla home from school until her symptoms wear off. At home, Camilla goes through a number of increasingly preposterous metamorphoses. She turns into a pill after being given one and grows roots, berries, crystals, feathers, and a long furry tail after receiving different medicine. She even has viruses, bacteria, and fungus colonies grow on her body after the community's expert scientists discuss these as a possible cause to her situation while examining her. Finally, she melts and merges into her room after an environmental therapist tells her to “become one with the room”. Finally, an old lady tells her to eat some lima beans. Camilla is afraid to admit her willingness to eat them at first, but after realizing that this could be her only hope of being cured, she allows the old woman to feed her them. Camilla is successfully reverted to a human and continues to eat lima beans; although her friends consider her strange for liking them, she doesn't even care a bit. She enjoys being different and never has stripes again. ==Analysis == === Themes === A Bad Case of Stripes discusses ethics and metaphysics, by highlighting self-perception, identity, and bullying. A Bad Case of Stripes teaches a lesson about the importance of being one's true self through a lima bean metaphor. In the beginning of the book, Camilla conforms to peer pressure, which is shown through her chameleon- like trait of blending into her surroundings. Camilla then learns about herself and her surroundings through her “nightmare metamorphosis.” By the end of the book, Camilla “regains her identity when she is true to herself.” In 2018, West Virginia First Lady, Cathy Justice, read this book to young children in honor of the Scholastic Summer Reading Challenge. The reading highlighted the book’s theme of teaching “children to be themselves and to respect those who may be different.” === Pedagogy === A Bad Case of Stripes is popular in the curricula of many elementary schools. A 2004 study found that it was a common read-aloud book for fourth-graders in schools in San Diego County, California. A 2007 online poll, the National Education Association listed the book as one of its "Teachers' Top 100 Books for Children." According to an elementary school teacher in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Donna M. Sawyer, Shannon’s story encourages students to consider their own experiences to develop a personal connection. Sawyer uses comprehension instruction with her third-graders to teach A Bad Case of Stripes. To increase student’s participation level, she incorporates both class-wide and small- group discussion and activities over many classes. For the students, this participation includes finding ways they connect to Camilla, organizing book details “into a story circle visual structure,” and creating episode analysis charts addressing Camilla’s problem, response, actions, and outcome. A Bad Case of Stripes has also been used in classrooms to prevent bullying. One teacher from Comber, Ontario, Lisa Babula, incorporated a read-aloud, journal reflections, and discussion in literature response groups into three 40-minute class periods. Online games about bullying and an exercise creating a hypothetical problem and solutions were also included in the lesson plan. These activities focus on understanding Camilla’s emotions and addressing the issue of bullying. Another approach to teaching A Bad Case of Stripes is using it to encourage students to eat their vegetables and to be brave about eating healthily. Students are told to make signs for the cafeteria promoting healthy eating because like Camilla, there are some foods that students might be afraid to eat with their friends. ==Reception== Kirkus Reviews found that "Shannon's story is a good poke in the eye of conformity--imaginative, vibrant, and at times good and spooky--and his emphatic, vivid artwork keeps perfect pace with the tale." A review by Sandra L. Tidwell said that "Shannon's colored illustrations are vibrant and animated, and they show a particular talent for vividly portraying facial expressions."Sandra L. Tidwell (April 1999). "A Bad Case of Stripes [book review]". www.trove.nla.gov.au. Farnsworth Juvenile Literature Library, Harold B. Lee Library, Brigham Young University. Retrieved 6 June 2015. A review by The Record highlights the children book’s applicability to all ages, stating that in addition to the entertainment and life-lessons the children benefit from, it “offers adults a giggle or two.” A Florida Times Union review states that A Bad Case of Stripes is “funny and entertaining,” supported perfectly by “lighthearted, bright, detailed illustrations.” It also received the 1999 Montana Treasure State Picture Book Award. A review by Carolyn Noah presents a somewhat negative take, calling the book “disturbing” and “viscerally troubling.” The book addresses anti-peer pressure, but also juggles dark humor. The review states that the book’s “grotesque,” “eye-popping,” and “oppressive” images will haunt the children reading. A Bad Case of Stripes has also received mixed reviews. A librarian at the University of New Brunswick, Lesley Beckett Balcom, recommends the book with reservations, stating, “the sensational illustrations, bold and surreal, are the strength in a book that tries rather too hard to teach a lesson.” An English teacher at Indiana University Northwest believes that A Bad Case of Stripes is “a little preachy at times,” yet this is made up for with the “tongue-in-cheek fun” the illustrations bring to the story. A San Francisco Chronicle article describes Shannon's illustrations as “vibrant,” “hilarious,” and “horrific.” ==References== Category:1998 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Fictional diseases and disorders

The film was released in the United States on November 1, 2017 and grossed over $130 million. It received mostly negative reviews, with criticism aimed at the thin story and raunchiness. In April 2019, it was announced that a sequel was in development. ==Plot== Amy is now in a happy relationship with Jessie and wants a simple Christmas. However, her overly critical mother, Ruth, derails her plans, texting her that she is coming for the holidays. Meanwhile, Kiki is still overworked with her four kids but now her husband Kent is much more helpful. Kiki is surprised when her mother Sandy shows up earlier than expected and for three weeks, overwhelming her. Carla has her own issues as her mother, Isis, has arrived unexpectedly for the first time in years; despite Carla being happy to see Isis, she's well aware that she expects something out of it. Amy, Kiki and Carla go to the mall and commiserate over the holidays. Complaining about the holiday pressure, they make a pact to "take Christmas back". Ruth tries to create a spectacle out of Christmas, rather than keeping it simple like Amy wants. Trying to tamp down those plans, Amy takes the family to Sky Zone to meet up with Kiki and Carla and their families. The grandmothers finally meet and chat. At work, Carla meets erotic dancer Ty, who is in town competing in a Sexy Santa competition. He asks her to be his date, which she accepts enthusiastically. Kiki continues to have issues with her mother's overbearingness, so brings Sandy to Dr. Karl, to discuss it, end up having a communication breakdown; Kiki scolds her and Sandy leaves the session. Amy and Kiki join Carla, attending the Sexy Santa show. Everyone is impressed with Ty's dancing. To everyone's surprise, Isis gets up on the bar and starts dancing with him. Carla runs up to get Ty back, leading to a fight. When Carla brings Isis home, she asks for money for a new investment; although Carla knows she's just going to gamble it away and then disappear as always, she loans her the money. On Christmas Eve, Sandy tells Kiki she bought the house next door to live closer to her. Finally, Kiki lashes out, telling her she can't as she needs some space. Sandy leaves the room crying. At the same time, Amy gets angry with Ruth when she discovers she has invited strangers to her home for an elaborate Christmas party, exactly what Amy told her not to do. Realizing Ruth is only going through with this to make herself relevant rather than be there for her grandkids, Amy and Ruth then get into a fight and accidentally knock down a Christmas Tree, ruining the house. Enraged, Amy yells at Ruth to get out of her life forever. Her kids, Jane and Dylan, witness this outburst and, fearing they'll be next, become upset with Amy. Meanwhile, Carla finds a goodbye note from Isis. Ruth goes to church for Midnight Mass, joined by Sandy and Isis. They criticize each other for their efforts as mothers, pointing out each other's flaws. Amy's father Hank talks to her about her horrible fight with her mom, where he reveals that Ruth, while difficult to deal with at times, is actually incredibly insecure and has always worried whether or not she was doing a good job as a mother, but has good intentions and loves Amy unconditionally. Amy goes to the church where Ruth is to repair their relationship. They apologize, confessing how much they genuinely love each other. Ruth tells Amy that she is a wonderful mother. They embrace tightly. As the clock strikes midnight, Amy realizes that she needs her mother to help her fix Christmas, so they rush home to decorate the house properly. On Christmas morning, Jane and Dylan come downstairs to see that Ruth has returned, the relationship has been repaired and the house looks wonderful. Kiki makes up with Sandy, who tells her she put the neighboring house on the market and admits that she has always felt lonely on Christmas since Kiki's father died. Carla is then visited by Isis, who is serious about turning her life around and has a new job at Sky Zone, though she confused as to how she passed the drug test. All the families get together for an unorthodox Christmas dinner. Amy, Kiki, and Carla applaud each other for doing what they set out to do; Ty, who has legitimately fallen in love with Carla, tracks her to Amy's house to start a relationship with her; Ruth, Sandy and Isis announce that they have become friends and are now planning to take a trip to Las Vegas to see Wayne Newton (something Kiki had demanded Sandy do). ==Cast== * Mila Kunis as Amy Redmond Mitchell * Kathryn Hahn as Carla Dunkler * Kristen Bell as Kiki Moore * Christine Baranski as Ruth Redmond * Susan Sarandon as Isis Dunkler * Cheryl Hines as Sandy Wilson * Peter Gallagher as Hank Redmond * Jay Hernandez as Jessie Harkness * Justin Hartley as Ty * Lyle Brocato as Kent Moore * Wanda Sykes as Dr. Elizabeth Karl * Oona Laurence as Jane Mitchell * Emjay Anthony as Dylan Mitchell * Ariana Greenblatt as Lori Harkness * Cade Cooksey as Jaxon Dunkler * Jacks Dean as Bernard Moore * Madison Muffley as Clare Moore * Christina Applegate as Gwendolyn James * Kenny G as himself ==Production== In December 2016, it was announced that A Bad Moms Christmas would be released on November 3, 2017, and that it would be Christmas-themed, with Bell, Hahn, and Kunis returning to reprise their roles.

Principal photography on the film began in Atlanta, Georgia on May 1, 2017. ==Release== A Bad Moms Christmas was released on Wednesday, November 1, 2017.

In Australia, the film was released under the title Bad Moms 2. ===Home media=== The film was released by Universal Pictures Home Entertainment on DVD and Blu-ray on February 6, 2018, in the United States and Canada. ==Reception== ===Box office=== A Bad Moms Christmas grossed $72.1 million in the United States and Canada, and $58.5 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $130.6 million, against a production budget of $28 million.

The website's critical consensus reads, "Featuring twice the moms but roughly half the laughs, A Bad Moms Christmas is a slapdash holiday sequel that falls short of the original with a disappointing dearth of good cheer." On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 42 out of 100, based on 30 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "B" on an A+ to F scale, down from the "A" earned by the first film, while PostTrak reported filmgoers gave it a "very low" 68% overall positive score. Owen Gleiberman of Variety gave the film a mixed review, writing, "A Bad Moms Christmas should appeal to the same—dare I say it?—demo that Bad Moms did, even though it's not nearly as wild a comedy. It has one halfway original idea, which is that when you're a mom yourself, the ability of your own mom to drive you nuts is heightened to the third power, because you're competing on levels that are almost primal." Pete Hammond of Deadline Hollywood gave the film a positive review, calling it a "good time movie" and writing: "...it goes way over the top, but I have to confess I laughed—a lot—and that's obviously the point even if this is not critic's fodder or meant to be. Subtle this is not, but A Bad Moms Christmas is the perfect tonic to lift your spirits and forget your troubles in these dark times." ==Sequel== In April 2019 during CinemaCon, it was announced that a sequel titled Bad Moms' Moms is in development. Sarandon, Baranski, and Hines will reprise their roles. In June 2021, it was reported that Bad Moms' Moms had been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==See also== * List of Christmas films ==References== ==External links== * * * A Bad Moms Christmas on Rotten Tomatoes Category:2017 films Category:2010s English-language films Category:2017 comedy films Category:2010s buddy comedy films Category:2010s Christmas comedy films Category:2010s female buddy films Category:American buddy comedy films Category:American Christmas comedy films Category:American female buddy films Category:American sequel films Category:Films about dysfunctional families Category:Films directed by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore Category:Films produced by Suzanne Todd Category:Films scored by Christopher Lennertz Category:Films set in Chicago Category:Films shot in Atlanta Category:Films with screenplays by Jon Lucas and Scott Moore Category:Huayi Brothers films Category:STX Entertainment films Category:2010s American films Category:English-language Christmas comedy films
55666066	A Bad Night	"A Bad Night" is a short story by E. W. Hornung, and features the gentleman thief A. J. Raffles, and his companion and biographer, Bunny Manders. The story was published in June 1905 by Pall Mall Magazine in London.Rowland, page 282 The story was also included as the sixth story in the collection A Thief in the Night, published by Chatto & Windus in London, and Charles Scribner's Sons in New York, both in 1905.Rowland, page 280. ==Plot== Raffles plans to burgle the house on the banks of the Mole of a bride-to-be, which is presently so laden with wedding gifts that she has had the gifts insured. However, Raffles is selected to play for the English in the Second Test Match, the first day of which will be the day of the wedding, when her gifts will be vulnerable. Bunny insists on taking the burglary job himself, so that Raffles can be free to serve his country. Raffles is anxious, but Bunny is eager to prove himself. The night of the wedding, Bunny sneaks to the house's garden. He stops to light a cigarette, merely to demonstrate his nerves. As Bunny finishes, a window opens overhead, and a wheezing voice accosts him. Bunny, relying on a story rehearsed with Raffles, pretends that he is from the insurance company. The young man at the window, who is the bride-to-be's asthmatic brother Mr. Medlicott, believes Bunny, and lets him into the house. Bunny follows Medlicott, who struggles to return to a library upstairs. Though Medlicott is ailing, he is kind, and he and Bunny discuss cricket. Bunny begins reluctantly to sympathize with Medlicott, and helps to keep the man's asthma pacified. Suddenly Bunny hears a noise, and looks out the window to see there is a new light from downstairs. When Bunny decides to go downstairs and investigate, Medlicott is impressed and offers his concealed revolver to Bunny, but Bunny prefers to use the life preserver he has brought. Downstairs, Bunny finds and quickly knocks out the burglar, only to realize afterward in anguish and bitterness that it is Raffles in disguise. Medlicott joins Bunny, and Bunny sends Medlicott to fetch the policeman on his beat outside. Raffles rises, and expresses his irritation. Together they escape the house. Raffles changes their clothes using garments he has hidden in some bushes, and they catch a train. Bunny only learns later that Medlicott had been unable to reach the policeman, and eventually had to struggle home. Bunny regrets having wronged both Raffles and Medlicott. Raffles, however, apologizes himself, and explains: rain had cut the day's cricket short, and he had been so anxious about Bunny that he had come to keep an eye on Bunny. He had followed Bunny the entire time, and had admired Bunny's performance throughout. Moreover, Raffles was able to take some jewellery from the collection of wedding presents. ==Adaptations== ===Television=== The story was adapted into the ninth episode of the Raffles television series, with Anthony Valentine as A. J. Raffles and Christopher Strauli as Bunny Manders. The episode, titled "A Bad Night", first aired on 22 April 1977. ===Radio=== BBC Radio adapted the story into the tenth episode of its Raffles radio drama, "A Bad Night", which first aired on 22 June 1988. The drama features Jeremy Clyde as Raffles and Michael Cochrane as Bunny. The episode follows the plot of the original story, with some changes: * In the drama, Raffles goes after this house as an act of revenge against young Medlicott's prosperous father, for the sake of the man's orphaned and financially ruined nephew, Spadger, who killed himself after his appeal for help from his rich uncle fell on deaf ears. * In the drama, rather than explain all to Bunny in the train afterwards, Raffles sleeps nearly all the way back to the cricket match in Trafford, thereby recovering well enough from Bunny's blow to play well against the Australians the next day. He explains his actions to Bunny in the Albany later. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * ==External links== * * Free online annotated version of "A Bad Night" * BBC Radio adaption of "A Bad Night” Category:1905 short stories Category:Works originally published in The Pall Mall Magazine Category:A.

11017293	A Bad Spell in Yurt	A Bad Spell in Yurt is a fantasy novel by C. Dale Brittain first published in 1991. It takes place in the fictional kingdom of Yurt where Daimbert, a wizard who has just graduated from the wizards' school, takes up his post as the new Royal Wizard. Daimbert's story is continued in The Wood Nymph and the Cranky Saint, Mage Quest, The Witch and the Cathedral, Daughter of Magic, and Is This Apocalypse Necessary? ==Synopsis== This story takes place in the tiny kingdom of Yurt. It reads like a charming, light-hearted story at first, but darker forces soon reveal themselves. Amongst themselves, the characters refer to the "three that rule the world", the aristocracy, the church, and wizardry. Though the aristocracy do the actual ruling, organized wizardry generally considers itself to be the superior of the three, in part because they put an end to the "Black Wars," wars between kingdoms so violent and bloody that individual wizards were forced to band together to stop them. Churchmen considers themselves superior to wizards, and they are traditional rivals in this semi- medieval world. The first-person narrator is Daimbert, who has just barely graduated from the wizards' school. He takes up his first post as Royal Wizard of Yurt. Daimbert barely graduated, owing to all that embarrassment with the frogs, yet he has amazing improvisational skills that manage to get him by. Daimbert soon befriends Joachim, the castle chaplain, attempts to make magical telephones from scratch, learns old herbal magic from his predecessor, fights a dragon from the northern land of wild magic, searches for the source of an evil spell on the king, and is forced to bargain with a demon. Here, magic is a wild force of four dimensions that is shaped by a wizard's spells or potions, and (usually) is spoken aloud using the Hidden Language, needed to channel magic for the means of a spell. However, wizards can also choose to sell their soul to a demon in return for supernatural powers. The book reads somewhat like a mystery, where Daimbert follows up on many clues throughout the story, eventually suspecting everyone in the castle. The caster of the evil spell is not revealed until the end of the book. ==Important characters== *Daimbert, main character and Royal Wizard of Yurt *Joachim, the royal chaplain *Prince Dominic, the king's nephew *Lady Maria, the queen's aunt *Zahlfast, second in command at the wizards' school *Haimeric, the King of Yurt *The Queen of Yurt, never named *Daimbert's predecessor as wizard of Yurt, never named ==References== *C.

39204695	A Bad Wind Blows in My Heart	A Bad Wind Blows in My Heart is the second studio album by English musician Bill Ryder-Jones. It was released in April 2013 under Domino Records. ==Background== Ryder-Jones recorded the album in an upstairs bedroom of his mother's house in Liverpool, England, with members of By the Sea as the backing band. The recordings were produced by Ryder-Jones himself, while it was mixed by James Ford and Darren Jones ==Music and lyrics== James Christopher Monger of Allmusic described the album as an "equally evocative, yet more traditional collection of songs that suggest what Nick Drake might have sounded like had he emerged in the early oughts instead of the late '60s." In addition, Monger felt that the release "never feels like a self- absorbed, autobiographical bore, as Jones' is an enigmatic enough narrator and a gifted enough arranger that what initially seems like ephemera turns out to be surprisingly affecting." At The Fly, Edward Devlin wrote that Ryder-Jones is "a skilled arranger with a keen eye for detail. This surprisingly assured collection of songs sounds like the work of a seasoned songwriter." Barry Nicolson of NME said that the effort is "not maudlin or cynical, but often quite comical", and noted that the music is being "delivered in a hushed, semi-spoken voice that frequently sounds like it’s trying to slunk out of the musical foreground. Once you’ve accustomed yourself to the sedate pace, something haunting, stately and – in a small-scale, arthousey sort of way – cinematic gradually reveals itself." The area of production was touched on by In Your Speakers' Theresa Flanagan who wrote that Ryder-Jones is "a well- seasoned veteran of the music industry and it shows in the well-crafted production, not so much in his genuinely humble affect." At Q, James Oldham highlighted that the album is "melancholic, tauntly-arranged and given warmth by Arctic Monkeys collaborator James Ford's sparse production". At musicOMH, Martin Headon wrote that "there's more than enough here to establish Ryder- Jones as a serious solo artist – all it needs is one more notch on the self- confidence dial, and that potential could translate into astounding results." Soundblab's Dan Clay told that the listener "leave[s] [...] feeling fully immersed, satisfied and impressed." This Is Fake DIY's Johnny Owen told that "while his vocal delivery sounds as though he’s having to force each word out through cracked lips at the end of a long night, the accompanying music fits perfectly" because it contains "a certain world-worn raggedness." At The 405, Mike Emerson felt that "the album could do with a couple more stand out moments both musically and vocally, however, as far as singer-songwriter albums go, this one stands out a mile." Furthermore, Emerson told that "the straight forward nature of the album doesn't do it any harm whatsoever, yet a lack of any major shift in tempo doesn't do it many favours", and that the truthfulness "really connects, and when distributed with such a softly spoken vocal the songs don't struggle to become quite hypnotising." Dean Van Nguyen of Pitchork wrote that Ryder-Jones "vocal is dulled and rasping throughout, and the songs never blossom like those on If..., seemingly hamstrung by his limited range." At the Metro, Amy Rose Dawson felt that the album "showcase[s] [...] more conventional songwriting in the indie folk vein, big on delicate guitar strumming and pretty piano chords." In terms of lyrics, Devin evoked that "the cathartic lyrics paint vivid pictures and emotional scenes throughout, while the grandeur of the compositions and stirring melodies lift the confessional bedroom ballads from potential despair to salvation." Headon felt that Ryder-Jones "skills as songwriter and arranger are clearly evident – each song builds with subtlety and restraint, and there’s a neat rhythmic twist halfway through Anthony & Owen that brings his former band to mind." Owen told that Ryder-Jones "resides firmly in singer-songwriter territory, occupying a space somewhere between fellow Domino alumni Elliott Smith and Bill Callahan." Emerson wrote that "there are soft guitars meandering slowly through gracious flows of percussion, as drifts of piano keys wash over the surface. Hushed, and often heartbreaking lyrics are ushered into proceedings and at first, everything seems quite basic. After a few plays of the album, you begin to appreciate the beauty of the arrangements, and realise that the structure of these tracks is undoubtedly the reason for their success." In addition, Emerson said that the album "takes somewhat of a step backwards in complexity, albeit with more overall components involved. It's more of a back to basics singer-songwriter album, put together with a 20/20 eye for composition." Van Nguyen noted how "If...'s more sweeping arrangements, playing to Ryder-Jones’s strengths, which are not insignificant, if sadly underused here." Dawson told that "the lyrics are very personal but pleasingly subtle, and Ryder-Jones can write a nice tune, but the whole thing starts to drift into one after a few tracks." ==Critical reception== A Bad Wind Blows in My Heart has received almost universally positive reception from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a "weighted average" score to ratings and reviews from selected mainstream music critics, the Metascore for the album is a 78, which is based on 10 reviews. At AnyDecentMusic?, they have a "weighted average" rating of a 7.3-out-of-ten that is based on 11 reviews. James Christopher Monger of Allmusic called it a "measured, melancholy, and mysterious, Jones' debut as a singer/songwriter is as subtle as it is striking, skillfully marrying the sedate melancholy of Elliott Smith with the sly, darkly comic lyricism of The National." At The Fly, Edward Devlin evoked that it is "an intimate and very British release to cherish and hold close; it also happens to be one of the year’s best so far." Barry Nicolson of NME proclaimed it to be "a meticulously crafted album." At The Observer, Phil Mongredien told that "there's a disarming openness to the lyrics and a warmth to the arrangements that make this an album that rewards repeated listening." Theresa Flanagan of In Your Speakers rated the album a 76-out-of-100, and affirmed that it "is a pretty big step out of the shadows for Ryder-Jones, which is clear in the genre-appropriate intimate vulnerability of the album." At Uncut, Jim Wirth noted how "the results are extraordinary." James Oldham of Q wrote that the album has "takes on a conventional band set-up, but it's as impressive, offering a crisply original take on the classic singer-songwriter approach." In addition, Oldham proclaimed Ryder-Jones "a true talent to keep an eye on." At Mojo, Lois Wilson highlighted that "the resulting songs [...] [are] beautifully built around guitar, piano, drums and strings [...] [and] are as their psycho-geography would suggest, intimate autobiographies, about ruined relationships." At musicOMH, Martin Headon alluded to how the release is "an intriguing prospect" that is "a brave album [...] predictably melancholy and unassuming, perhaps, but also highly accomplished and sometimes deeply affecting." Dan Clay of Soundblab rated that album a 7.5-out-of-ten, and told that Ryder-Jones has "honed his melodic skills" because he has "emerged from jangly-pop kings The Coral," with an album that has a "melancholy feel." At This Is Fake DIY, Johnny Owen found that "while it had to have taken some stones to leave his comfort zone and decide to go his own way with no safety net, it seems like it was a gamble that’ll pay off for both him and us", and this leaves "any doubts though have [arisen], with 'A Bad Wind Blows In My Heart', [have] been well and truly dispelled." Mike Emerson of The 405 rated the album a 7-out-of-ten, and called it "a luxurious listen." However, Dean Van Nguyen of Pitchfork rated that album a 5.2-out-of-10.0, and noted how the album has "a clumsy title," but found "what's most disappointing about the album is how Ryder-Jones has almost completely abandoned taking any sonic risks." At the Metro, Amy Rose Dawson evoked that the release "provides some momentary oomph [...] but this is ultimately music for those who find the likes of Damien Rice over-stimulating." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Bill Ryder-Jones – producer ;Production * James Ford – additional producer, additional engineer, mixing * Darren Jones – additional producer, additional engineer, additional mixing ;Other personnel * Matthew Cooper – design * Paul J.

The album title comes from a line in the poem "Nostalgia" by American poet Billy Collins. ==Reception== Jakob Dorof of Tiny Mix Tapes gave the album 4 stars out of 5, saying, "The result is likely one of the best hip- hop songs you'll hear this year, let alone from the rare type of MC that manages to be white, female, and supremely talented all in one." The A.V. Club listed it as the 20th best album of 2010. In 2010, City Pages listed it as the "Best Local Album of the Past 12 Months".

The soundtrack was written and performed by British folk musician Johnny Flynn. ==Plot== Ben and Alan are great friends who have known each other since high school, and they haven't grown up. For a living, they pose as valets at funerals and then steal their customers' cars and sell them to a pessimistic car dealer. Melanie, Alan's sister, encourages them to find respectable occupations, but Ben and Alan don't take Mel's advice. Then, Lynette moves into their neighborhood. She is a single mother who is financially insecure and has a short temper, as Mel finds out. When Lynette commits suicide, Alan and Ben take her son Kelsey under their wing.

However, they come to realize that Kelsey needs more suitable role models, and Ben and Alan will have to grow up. ==Cast== * Jason Ritter as Ben Dwellman * Jake Sandvig as Alan Manilow * Chandler Canterbury as Kelsey Patterson ** Johnny Simmons as Kelsey, age 18 * Rebecca Hall as Melanie "Mel" Manilow * Carrie Preston as Lynette Patterson * Todd Louiso as Marty * Gabriel Macht as Wyatt * Amanda Seyfried as Amanda Beekler * Micah Hauptman as Vince Ortega * Elmarie Wendel as The Mark ==Reception== ===Critical response=== A Bag of Hammers received mixed reviews.

Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote in his review: "A Bag of Hammers, Brian Crano's low-budget dramedy and first feature, is certainly sure of itself. Any film tossing comic interludes among its closing credits has to be convinced of their hilarity and of the good will the movie has earned with viewers by then. Perhaps the film's naked traffic in sentiment up to that point made Mr. Crano so bold. Whatever; his confidence was unwarranted." John DeFore of The Hollywood Reporter wrote in his review: "First-time director Brian Crano delivers a muddled comedy starring Jason Ritter and Rebecca Hall about two felons who unexpectedly wind up taking care of a neglected child." Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club enjoyed the film and gave it a B−. Other reviewers, such as Nick Schager of Time Out New York hated the film, giving it one star out of five. ===Release=== A Bag of Hammers was released for a limited time starting March 12, 2011, at the SXSW festival and in theatres May 12, 2012.

1177256	A Bag of Marbles	A Bag of Marbles () is a Second World War autobiographical novel by the French Jewish author Joseph Joffo.

But in 1941, when Paris is occupied by the Nazis, his childhood comes to an end. Never before having known what it means to be a Jew, Joseph is forced to wear a yellow star. Due to his schoolmate's admiration of the yellow star, he makes his first business transaction with Zérati, a friend from school: his yellow star exchanged for a bag of marbles. The racism which results from the occupation leaves only one possibility to Joseph and his brother Maurice: they must flee. Their father, who owns a hairdressing salon, advises them what to do when they leave. Despite having been driven from their home because of their Jewish identity, they are told they must never let anyone know that they are Jews. They are attempting to escape from the grasp of Hitler and his S.S. men as they infiltrate France. They travel through northern France to the de-militiarised zone in the South. They cross the Demarcation Line in the dead of night with the help of another young boy called Raymond. Once into safe France they travel down to Menton via Marseille, where they spend a fantastic day taking in the sea - something they have never seen before. The boys then spend four blissfully safe months in Menton with their brothers, Henri and Albert, before having to leave the town for Nice, where their parents are waiting. The boys spend the summer in Nice with their parents. But due to the surrender of the Italians, when they removed Mussolini in favor of Pietro Badoglio, and the arrival of the Germans in safe France, they have to flee quickly to "Moisson Nouvelle", a camp for boys run by the Vichy government. The boys are safe here for a while, and make many friends, until one day when they accompany the lorry driver Ferdinand into Nice where he leads them, unintentionally, straight into a Nazi trap. They are taken to the "Hotel Excelsior", the Nazi headquarters in the region. Fortunately, due to their carefully thought up lies and the persistence of a priest, they escape a month later, still alive but pretty rattled. Sadly, they soon learn of the arrest of their father, who had his papers with him at the time, which means it is no longer safe for the two youngsters to remain in Nice. As the autumn turns to winter, Joseph and Maurice travel north to see their sister, where they learn that it is unsafe for them to stay; so they go to join their brothers in the Alpine resort of Aix-les-Bains. Here Maurice spends the rest of the war working in a bakery, and Joseph works for the owner of the village bookshop - a staunch Petainist. The two brothers also brush up with resistance fighters in the area, when Joseph has to pass on a secret message. Joseph returns to Paris shortly after peace is announced, in an over- crowded train. Maurice returns by road, although in his typical style he also takes enough cheese to make a very large profit on! They are both re-united with their family in the salonalthough sadly not their father, who was murdered in the Auschwitz concentration camp before the end of the war. ==Films and graphic novel== A 1975 film adaptation of the novel was directed by Jacques Doillon.

38903665	A Balcony in Paris	A Balcony in Paris (French: Un balcon à Paris) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the French Impressionist painter Gustave Caillebotte. It was completed c. 1880–1881. The dimensions of the painting are 55.2 by 39 centimeters. It is housed in a private collection. ==Description== This painting is one of several by Caillebotte in which an urban street, viewed from a balcony, is seen through the spaces of an ornate iron grill in the foreground, differentiating the space of the street from the interior of his bourgeois home, 31 boulevard Haussmann in Paris. The motif may have been inspired by similar juxtapositions seen in many Japanese ukiyo-e prints.Varnedoe, Kirk (1987). Gustave Caillebotte.

34488106	A Ball for Daisy	A Ball for Daisy is a 2011 children's wordless picture book written and illustrated by Chris Raschka. The book tells the story of a dog named Daisy, who has a beloved ball destroyed and then replaced. Raschka won the 2012 Caldecott Medal for his illustrations in the book. The creation of the book took years but was praised for its ability to evoke emotion in the reader. A sequel, Daisy Gets Lost, was released in 2013. == Background and publication == Author and illustrator Chris Raschka first thought about the idea for A Ball for Daisy 10 years before writing it, after seeing how upset his son got after he lost a ball thanks to a dog. Prior to creating the book he sketched various combinations of balls and dogs. Raschka described the process of creating the book as a difficult one. He had wanted to write a wordless picture book so that "a child could read the book without knowing how to read. The challenge lay in conveying the emotions the way he wanted to, but without any words. The book was published May 10, 2011 and was followed by a sequel, Daisy Gets Lost, in 2013. == Plot == A Ball for Daisy is a wordless children's picture book that tells the story of a small white dog named Daisy and her favorite red ball. Daisy is so obsessed with the ball that she takes it everywhere with her, sleeps with it, and overall has to be near it constantly. As her owner takes Daisy out for a walk one day, her ball gets snatched by a brown dog wanting to play. Daisy tries her hardest to get the ball back, but the other dog insists on playing with it and accidentally pops it. Daisy's owner then throws the ball in the trash and takes Daisy home. For a while, Daisy acts distraught over her loss. Later, Daisy's owner takes her for another walk, and on the walk they see the same dog that popped Daisy's ball, but this time that dog has a shiny new blue ball. The other dog gives the blue ball to Daisy, which makes her very happy. == Writing and illustrations == The story centers on an idea and theme that is relatable to for children and could help build emotional resiliency.Marcus, L. S. (2012). Chris Raschka Unleashed. Horn Book Magazine, 88(4), 32–35. Retrieved from ebscohost. Many reviewers commented on Raschka's strength in depicting emotions so well. He uses colors to help depict the changing moods in the story. Raschka illustrated the book using watercolors. Several reviewers also commented on Raschka's skill with broad brushstrokes. The illustrations give the appearance of having been drawn without revision and combine watercolor and comic book drawing techniques. Its Caldecott win was part of a trend of wordless picture books being honored, which began with David Wiesner's honor book Free Fall and part of Rashka's ability to "take risks" with each of his books. == Reception and awards == The book was well reviewed, gaining starred reviews from The Horn Book Magazine,HORNING, K. T. (2011). A Ball for Daisy. Horn Book Magazine, 87(5), 77. Retrieved from ebscohost. which praised the book as "noteworthy for both its artistry and its child appeal"; Kirkus Reviews, which wrote of how "rarely, perhaps never, has so steep an emotional arc been drawn with such utter, winning simplicity"; and School Library Journal, which noted how it matched the illustrator's other work, "Raschka continues to experiment with what is essential to express the daily joys and tribulations of humans and animals." The book was a New York Times Best Seller and was named by it as one of the best books of 2011. The book was awarded the 2012 Caldecott award. "Chris Raschka’s deceptively simple paintings of watercolor, gouache and ink explore universal themes of love and loss that permit thousands of possible variants", said Caldecott Medal Committee Chair Steven L. Herb. The Wall Street Journal agreed with its choice as a Caldecott Medal recipient. Raschka had never dreamed that he might win the Caldecott and was on his way to his studio when the committee called to tell him of his win. ==References== Category:2011 children's books Category:Caldecott Medal–winning works Category:American picture books Category:Children's books about dogs Category:Wordless books
63462998	A Ballad About Green Wood	A Ballad About Green Wood () is a 1983 Czechoslovak short film written and directed by Jiří Barta. It is also known as The Ballad of Green Wood. It tells a story about spring and renewal, portrayed with animated pieces of firewood. It is inspired by the Legend of Vesna from Slavic folklore. ==Plot== A man chops firewood in the winter and leaves the wood in the snow. One of the split pieces has a woman's face. As the snow melts, the wood pieces begin to dance. Water flows and plants sprout around them. A rook attacks and eats the piece with a woman's face. The rook's body turns into a piece of wood with a distorted carved face. Plants die and the snow returns. The rook flies into a cave and goes to sleep. The sun rises and shines into the cave. The rook awakens and sees a piece of wood that looks like a knight on horseback. The knight charges and kills the rook with its lance. The firewoods place the rook's body on a pile of twigs, from which greenery grows and covers it. The rook transforms into a piece of firewood with a woman's face, and grows green twigs of its own, as the other firewoods dance around it. Back at the original location, the man picks up the firewoods and rips off the green twigs before he goes inside. Smoke comes out of his chimney. ==Themes== The film celebrates the cyclical renewal of life in the spring. According to Barta, humans are always subject to the flow of the natural world. His own ambition, which is reflected in the film, is to be attentive to nature and follow its rhythm. The film scholar Adam Whybray describes the film as a series of movements between anthropocentric rational time and the natural world's natural or traditional time. Natural time becomes ecstatic in the spring, is frozen during the winter, and then renewed the next spring. Jenny Jediny of Not Coming to a Theater Near You writes that the "fondness for the ancient and mythological" foreshadows Barta's 1986 film The Pied Piper". ==Production== The story is based on a folk tale about the Sun Prince and the virgin Vesna. The film was originally conceived in the 1970s and was to be directed by František Vláčil, but due to other commitments Vláčil abandoned it. Barta revived the project and changed its artistic direction. The film was shot in the Bohemian Forest, the High Tatras, the Koněprusy Caves and at Studio Jiřího Trnky in Prague. Barta chose to make it outdoors because he was determined that a film about nature should depict real nature. This proved demanding due to the heavy reliance on stop-motion puppet animation, performed by the animator Milan Svatoš, and the impact of the weather. Clouds and the sun's position created strict time limits, wind would blow over the meticulously positioned puppets, and rain caused halts in the production. The depiction of thaw was achieved by pouring water over a snowpack for several hours. The musical score was composed by Vladimír Merta. ==Reception== Reviewing the DVD Jiri Barta: Labyrinth of Darkness in 2006, Jamie S. Rich of DVD Talk described the film as "more visually stunning than illuminating, but cool all the same". He wrote that the video quality was poor; "probably the worst looking of the set"; and the audio "mixed a little low, as well". In Animation: A World History (2016), the scholars Giannalberto Bendazzi and Tommaso Iannini call it "a simple, short film of great impact". ==See also== * List of films based on Slavic mythology ==References== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * * Catalogue entry at Krátký film Praha Category:1983 animated films Category:1983 short films Category:1983 films Category:Czechoslovak animated short films Category:Films directed by Jiří Barta Category:Animated films based on Slavic mythology Category:1980s animated short films

11631735	A Ballad of the West	A Ballad of the West is a three-part story by Bobby Bridger told in Homeric verse and song about the Mountain Men, William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody, and the Lakota Sioux people inspired by John G. Neihardt's A Cycle of the West. Part One: Seekers of the Fleece: This ballad presents the life story of mountain man Jim Bridger and the Fur Trade Era. Jim Bridger is Bobby Bridger's great granduncle. Beginning with Jim Bridger's historic ascension of the Missouri River with the Ashely-Henry Expedition in 1822, Seekers of the Fleece tells of the initial interactions between Euro-Americans and Native Americans, as well as the beginning of the American Emigration Era and the Indian Wars. This ballad was inspired by Alfred Jacob Miller's Western watercolors. Part Two: Pahaska: Pahaska is the Lakota word for "long hair," what the Sioux fondly called William F. "Buffalo Bill" Cody, and subsequently the name of the second ballad in the trilogy. Beginning with Buffalo Bill's birth in 1846, Pahaska chronicles Buffalo Bill's adventurous boyhood on the Great Plains, his career as a Pony Express rider, buffalo hunter, army scout, and his rise to global celebrity with the creation of the Wild West Show. Bobby Bridger also wrote a biography on Buffalo Bill recently published by the University of Texas Press, titled Buffalo Bill and Sitting Bull: Inventing the Wild West. Part Three: Lakota: Lakota begins with the meeting of Nebraska epic poet, John Neihardt, and the Lakota Holy Man, Black Elk, in South Dakota in 1931, of which would bring the famous book Black Elk Speaks. A 'telling of a telling of a telling,' Lakota presents Black Elk's recollections to Neihardt of the Indian Wars Era (1860–1890), Red Cloud and the Fetterman Massacre, the Battle of Little Big Horn, the deaths of Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull, travels with Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show, and the Massacre at Wounded Knee. A Ballad of the West was partially recorded in a tipi in the Colorado Rockies and completed in a 24 track studio in Denver in 1975 with Slim Pickens and The Lost Gonzo Band: John and Jim Inmon, Bob Livingston, Gary P. Nunn and Donnie Dolan. Slim's love of the mountain men brought him to volunteer his talents to narrate Seekers of the Fleece. Bridger has been performing A Ballad of the West around the globe for nearly four decades as a one-man show. ==See also== * Slim Pickens ==External links== * Bobby Bridger official site * Collection of Alfred Jacob Miller watercolors of the American West Category:2000 compilation albums
43752912	A Ballad upon the Popish Plot	"A Ballad upon the Popish Plot" is an early modern English broadside ballad about a fabricated conspiracy known as "The Popish Plot" that occurred between 1678 and 1681 in the kingdoms of England and Scotland, during a period of widespread social and cultural prejudice against Catholicism. The song records an indictment of the Plot—a crucial consequence of national religious conflict that arguably began with the English Reformation—in the form of the ballad, one of the most time-honored and influential styles of popular music. ==Synopsis== The ballad describes widespread interest in the Plot across social class and region (“From Pulpit to Pot / They talk’d of a Plot” [1.5-6]), as well as the fear invoked in the general population (“frighted with Fire-balls, their heads turned round” [1.4]), but then proposes a rational and just correction of these effects. The majority of the rest of the ballad then lists the occupational types, personal characteristics, and machinations of the participants in the plot. The first is a politician “of Body unsound,” who intends to slander the Pope and the current King, Charles II, until both are forced out of power (2.1, 8). The narrator then describes the personal circumstances that brought him to instigate the plot: financial difficulty, lack of public approval, and ultimately a bribe (“Some Whisperers fix’d him / Upon this design” [3.5-6]). The other participants include a vicious, imprisoned “Knave” (4.1) complicit with another plotter who will “[Relieve] his Invention, and [quicken] his Pace” (4.9); an imprisoned thief and murderer; a perjurer who twice lied about the occurrences of the plot, bribed with money the second time; a professional in the Court who encouraged rumors of the plot with a fellow guilty court-member; and a dull-witted, ill- dressed merchant who supports the plot by writing about it in the press. The narrator ends with a “Prayer” against the plotters and for the providence and safety of the current King, and with the hope that the participants will be executed at Tyburn, a village in Middlesex County well known for capital punishment of London criminals and martyrs. ==Authorship and historical basis== The ballad is one of several that describe the “Popish Plot” in England and Scotland between 1678 and 1681, and the print publication of the ballad is tentatively dated from 1678 or 1679. All versions of this ballad held at the English Broadside Ballad Archive at the University of California, Santa Barbara, which are part of the James Ludovic Lindsay Crawford collection at the National Library of Scotland, indicate in the subtitle that the author is "a lady of quality." However, the compilers of The National Union Catalog Pre-1956 Imprints have identified John Gadbury (1627–1704), an English astrologer, almanac writer, and otherwise prolific author, as the composer of several versions of the ballad held at the Bodleian Library at Oxford University. Gadbury, a High Tory and Catholic convert, had been wrongfully imprisoned at the time of the Plot. However, Yale librarian and literary cataloger Donald Wing has attributed the ballad to Elizabeth Somerset Herbert Powis (1633–1691) who, along with her husband William Herbert, first Marquess of Powis (or Powys), was one of the most influential Roman Catholics of that time. As one of the “Five Catholic Lords” falsely accused by Titus Oates of plotting in the King's assassination, her husband was imprisoned in the Tower of London for six years. Her attempts to free him in the so-called “Meal-tub Plot” very nearly led to her own conviction for treason. ==Cultural and historical significance== This ballad is one of a group on the Popish Plot included in the Bagford Ballad collection, whose ballads depict the last years of the Stuart reign at the end of the 17th century. As the preface to the third volume of the collection describes, the value of ballads such as these is that they allow readers to "follow [...] the varying emotions" of "the average men and women" of the early modern era -- "their joys, their griefs, their boastfulness, their anger"—as well as give a narrative of important social, political, and cultural events of the time. Thus this ballad, and the group of ballads of which it is a part, serve a valuable historical and cultural function not only as records or descriptions of significant past political events but also because they give readers access to the subjective quality of the lives of that era's common people. As Joseph Woodfall Ebsworth, the editor and annotator of the second division of the published Bagford Ballad collection, evocatively phrases it: "Here, if we choose to pay attention, are clearly written the contemporary records of how men [and women] felt and spoke during the mad excitement, the servile terror, and the ferocious hatred of the days when clamours echoed against the so-called 'Popish Plot'" (viii). By giving readers access to the inner lives of the common people, and especially that part of their inner lives that was emotionally engaged by tumultuous political events such as the Popish Plot, these ballads provide a counterweight to, or throw into relief, other ballads in the collection that merely depict the social life of the Stuart kings, thus enriching our contemporary understanding of the social and political dynamics of the era. They also serve as a relevant reminder—and warning—of the power religious bigotry can exercise over a general population when allowed to develop unchecked. == References == *Ebsworth, Joseph Woodfall, ed.

10119231	A Balladeer	A Balladeer (styled as a balladeer) is a Dutch band, originating from Amsterdam, founded by singer-songwriter Marinus de Goederen. In 2002, the band won the 3FM BuZz Award and another award the following year at the final of the annual Dutch musical contest De Grote Prijs van Nederland (The Big Prize of the Netherlands). In 2004, A Balladeer opened up for international acts Saybia and Keane and released their first EP: Rumor Had It. The EP featured 4 songs, including the critically acclaimed "They've Shut Down Marks & Spencer", which resulted in considerable airplay in the Netherlands. On 5 May 2006, A Balladeer's debut album titled Panama was released by EMI Music. The single "Swim with Sam" was the first single. It became a hit in the Netherlands. The album was recorded in Brussels in 2005 with Bløf producer Ronald Vanhuffel. Robert Kirby (known for his work with Nick Drake) arranged the strings for three songs. In early 2007, the band won a Zilveren Harp (Silver Harp), a supporting prize for promising musical artists. In February 2007, their third single was released, a ballad called "Robin II". The second album, Where Are You, Bambi Woods?, was released on 29 August 2008. The album is partly about the year the lead singer lived near Dallas, Texas. Its title track is about the disappearance of porn star Bambi Woods (known from her role in Debbie Does Dallas). 'Poster Child' is an ode to the murdered student Matthew Shepard. In 2009 the album got nominated for an Edison, a Dutch Grammy. The third album, I Can't Keep Track Of Each Fallen Robin, was released on 19 October 2012.

2240588	A Ballads	A Ballads (stylized as 15px BALLADS) is the second greatest hits album by Japanese recording artist Ayumi Hamasaki. It was released physically on March 12, 2003 through Avex Trax, and digitally distributed worldwide on September 14, 2006 by Avex Entertainment Inc. It is her first compilation release in two years since A Best; it premiered three months after her sixth studio album Rainbow. The compilation compiles ballad-inspired singles released by Hamasaki between 1998 and 2003, while the material is divided into new-arrangement remixes and the original versions. With all the tracks written by Hamasaki, it includes two new songs—"Rainbow", which served as the album's promotional single, and a cover version of Japanese singer Yumi Matsutoya's 1975 track "Sotsugyō Shashin". Released in six formats featuring a photograph by JFKK, A Ballads received favorable reviews from music critics. Many praised the collection for including some of Hamasaki's best vocal work, and commended the songwriting. Minor criticism was aimed on the newer renditions of the original songs. Commercially, the album was a success in Japan, reaching number one on the Oricon Albums Chart, making it Hamasaki's second compilation and eighth album to reach the top spot. It was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. The album experienced limited promotion during its release, with some of the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements. ==Background and material== In December 2002, Hamasaki released her sixth studio album Rainbow. Early issues of the album included a code number and URL address that allowed customers to visit an exclusive website that promoted the album and listen to a 40-second demo of her unfinished song "Rainbow". During its promotion, Avex Trax and Hamasaki received over 100,000 messages from fans, telling them their opinions about the unfinished demo. Due to the mixed response of her fanbase, Hamasaki decided to develop the song further and release it as part of an upcoming compilation album, which was later named A Ballads. During the process, Hamasaki confessed that "[she] had never before written lyrics that were based on messages received directly from [her] fans. It was with "Rainbow" that [she] decided to give this approach a try". A Ballads is Hamasaki's first compilation to compile songs that were inspired by ballad music, with it portraying her second greatest hits album after A Best (2001). Each track from the album was released either as a single or as a promotional recording, recorded between the years 1998 and 2003. Six of the tracks on the album were composed and co-produced by Hamasaki, who used the alias Crea. The album consists of fifteen tracks, including two new recordings—"Rainbow" and a cover version of Japanese singer Yumi Matsutoya's 1975 track "Sotsugyō Shashin". Seven of the album's tracks—"Appears", "You", "To Be", "M", "Seasons", "A Song for ××" and "Who..."— feature new arrangements and compositions, while the songs "Key", "Hanabi", "Dearest" and "Voyage" are included with their original versions. ==Songs== To explain Hamasaki's the background and development, Hamasaki hosted a commentary on her website. The first song, "Rainbow", was originally composed by CMJK, but Hamasaki felt the finishing product was "missing something", and re-worked the demo version with Japanese musician Dai Nagao. According to Hamasaki, she wanted to reflect the emotion and words used in each 100,000 messages she received from her fans to create the song, but because there were numerous emails, she decided to write it as a summary and her feelings as an "aftermath" from reading the messages. The song was described by a staff member at CD Journal as an "organic midtempo pop ballad" song. "Appears" was remixed by Japanese group HΛL. According to Hamasaki, she had asked the group to re-compose their original version of the track in order to reflect "current [musical] themes of 2003." The album included the original version of "Key (Eternal Tie)" as Hamasaki felt that the original was "more important and unknown" than the proposed-reworked version she had planned. "You (Northern Breeze)" was one of the last reworked tracks, and was described by Hamasaki as being influenced by Western music. "To Be (2003 ReBirth Mix)" was not re-worked or re-arranged by any of the album's collaborators, with it being purely remastered and mixed again by music engineer Koji Morimoto. "Hanabi" was one of the album's only tracks to appear in its original version, and has been described by a CD Journal staff member to have been inspired by Europop, trip hop, and dub music. "Dolls", a J-pop influenced pop ballad, remained the sophomore original track to make part of the record. Like "To Be", the next track "Seasons" was remastered and mixed by Morimoto. The final original track, "Voyage", was described by CD Journal as a midtempo ballad influenced by gospel music, layered with several string arrangements and other instrumentation. "A Song for ××" was re-worked as a live demo, recorded at the Avex Trax studios in Japan. For the promotional track "Who...", Hamasaki asked CMJK to create a more "warmer" version than the original. The closing track for A Ballads was "Sotsugyō Shashin". According to Hamasaki, she had imagined recording a cover for a studio album, but was unsuccessful at doing so. To compose the track, she and the song's co-composer Tasuku composed it by using a Fender Rhodes Suitcase Mk I electric piano in order to reflect the song's original 1960s–1970s pop influence. ==Release== A Ballads was released physically on March 12, 2003 through Avex Trax in five formats, and digitally distributed worldwide on September 14, 2006 by Avex Entertainment Inc. The first five formats were compact discs; each one of the four early editions included a slipcase sleeve that had two clones of Hamasaki asleep next to each other, with the inner booklet portraying four different photographs of the clones. The four alternative covers were different variations of the two Hamasaki figures in a pink-coloured room. The fifth format came without a slipcase, and had the slipcase image as the inner booklet cover. The digital release featured the slipcase cover and the entire photo shoot was photographed by JFKK. ==Reception== Upon its release, A Ballads received favorable reviews from most music critics. Tetsuo Hiraga from Hot Express believed that the album's material was able to connect with both younger and older audiences. He also pointed out the "Royal-esque" tracks "Seasons" and "Dearests" as some of her best recordings. In a similar review, a staff member of CD Journal enjoyed the album and complimented its new additions to the album. Commercially, the album was successful in Japan, with it debuting at number one on the Oricon Albums Chart and replacing 200 Km/h in the Wrong Lane (2002) by Russian female duo t.A.T.u. at the top spot. Hamasaki's entry sold 561,127 units in comparison to t.A.T.u.'s 167,627 unit sales. By the end of 2003, A Ballads was ranked at number eight as the best selling album in Japan of that year. It sold 917,555 units, and was also her second album to enter the top ten, just behind Rainbow which sold 1,856,919 units. As of July 2016, it has sold over 924,242 units, her first greatest hits album to not sell over the one million mark. Nevertheless, it was certified Million by the Recording Industry Association of Japan (RIAJ) for shipments of one million units. It is Hamasaki's ninth best selling album based on Oricon's sale database. ==Promotion== The album experienced limited promotion during its release, with some of the tracks appearing during Japanese commercial endorsements. The compilation's only release was promotional song "Rainbow", which was used as the theme song for Hamasaki's Japanese talk show Ayuready?, and to promote products by Lumix. An accompanying music video for the song was directed by Wataru Takeishi, featuring two clones of Hamasaki chasing each other, and eventually meeting at a dinner in Japan. Near the end of the video, it is revealed that the second clone is in fact her imagination or conscious. ==Track listing== ==Charts== Oricon Sales Chart (Japan) Release Chart Peak position First Week Sales Sales total Chart run 12 March 2003 Oricon Daily Albums Chart 1 Oricon Weekly Albums Chart 1 561,127 1,330,000 53 weeks Oricon Monthly Albums Chart 1 Oricon Yearly Albums Chart 4 ==Release history== Region Date Format Catalogue number Japan March 12, 2003 CD (Copy Control CD) AVCD-17278 Taiwan 2003 CD (Copy Control CD) AVJCD-10160 Hong Kong March 2003 CD (Copy Control CD) AVTCD-95676 Indonesia 2003 Cassette AV 0370303 ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *A Ballads at Oricon Style.

46432077	A Ballerina's Tale	A Ballerina's Tale is a 2015 documentary film revolving around the career of Misty Copeland, who serves as the narrator of the film as well as its subject. The film premiered on April 19, 2015, at the Tribeca Film Festival. It was released through video on demand on October 13, 2015, prior to opening in a limited release on October 14, 2015, by Sundance Selects. A version of it, which is available on the PBS website, was also aired by PBS stations beginning in February 2016. The film received mostly positive reviews. ==Synopsis== The film follows the daily life of Copeland with emphasis on her role as one of the first African-American female soloists to present what Mekado Murphy of The New York Times describes as the process of the dancer. The film begins with archival footage of a young Copeland at a small ballet studio and focuses on her cultural impact and professional ascension, despite injuries and other challenges, without delving into her personal history. ==Development== On September 20, 2013, Nelson George announced a $40,000 Kickstarter campaign to fund production of a documentary film about the life of Misty Copeland. The campaign raised US$54,251 with 657 backers. Prince contributed a "substantial sum" to the campaign.Callahan, Yesha. "Watch Prince Perform 'The Beautiful Ones' With Misty Copeland" , The Root, April 25, 2016 The film is one of several forms of media publicity surrounding Copeland who has become a trailblazing ballerina with the American Ballet Theatre. ==Release== The film premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival on April 19, 2015, accompanied by a ballet performance. Copeland, who narrates the film, spoke following its premiere. Sundance Selects acquired the US distribution rights to the film. The film was released through video on demand on October 13, 2015, and the following day began a limited release in US cinemas. A 55-minute version of it aired beginning on February 8, 2016, as part of PBS' Independent Lens series. ==Critical response== A Ballerina's Tale received mostly positive reviews. It holds a 73% Fresh rating on the website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 11 reviews with an average rating of 7.8/10. It holds a 57 score on Metacritic based on 4 reviews. Maya Chung for NBCnews.com wrote: "A Ballerina's Tale is one film that is making that impact. The documentary gives an in-depth picture of Copeland's struggles with being black in a predominantly white Ballet world and it chronicles her experience recovering from a leg fracture - one that could've stopped her dream of becoming a principal dancer." Amy Brady from The Village Voice commented: "In A Ballerina's Tale, director Nelson George paints a moving portrait of Copeland that underscores her triumphs over bodily and historical limitations. ... The film is structured around mid-career highlights – Copeland's solo performance in The Firebird at the Metropolitan Opera House, her career-defining role as Odette/Odile in Swan Lake – but it reminds us that her rise to stardom was marked by self-doubt and a need for mentorship." The film is not considered "eye-opening" according to Louise Blouin Media's Regina Mogilevskaya, but the presentation of Copeland as a performer is what makes the film memorable. ==Notes== ==External links== * official website * official trailer * Tribecca Film Festival official listing * official listing at IFC Films * 55-minute version of A Ballerina's Tale, PBS (2016) * * Category:2015 films Category:2015 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about ballet Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s American films
72032959	A Ballet of Lepers	A Ballet of Lepers: A Novel and Stories is a posthumous collection of fiction by Canadian author and singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, consisting of the novella A Ballet of Lepers, fifteen short stories and a précis for a play. The collection was edited, with an afterword, by Alexandra Pleshoyano and was published in 2022. ==Themes== The titular novella, written at Cohen's childhood home in the Westmount area of Montreal, is narrated by an aimless, solitary bookkeeper of 35 who is renting a room in Stanley Street, Montreal and takes in his grandfather who needs a place to live. The grandfather, whom he has never met before, scorns societal taboos and embraces a liberating exercise of violence. Themes explored in the novella and stories include "the sacred and profane dimensions of sexual desire; the longing for an ideal woman, capable of a liberating love; a search for freedom in a world of limitations and boundaries; the challenge—and even incapacity—to embrace commitment; feelings of alienation; the dread flowing from a sense of unworthiness coupled with an aspiration for the transcendent and the beautiful." ==Publishing history== Although Cohen wrote the novella in 1956-7, some years before writing his first published novel The Favourite Game, it was only published posthumously in 2022. Cohen once called A Ballet of Lepers "probably a better novel" than The Favourite Game, but despite his best efforts failed to get it published. The manuscript of the novella, along with a collection of short stories and plays, is kept in the Leonard Cohen archive at the University of Toronto. There are four drafts, the second and most complete of which was selected for publication. The stories, written (mostly) between 1956 and 1960, were also previously unpublished. They are titled: "Saint Jig", "O.K. Herb, O.K. Flo", "Signals", "Polly", "A Hundred Suits from Russia", "Ceremonies", Mister Euemer Episodes", "The Shaving Ritual", "Lullaby", "A Week is a Very Long Time", "The Jukebox Heart", "David Who?", "Short Story on Greek Island", "ive had lots of pets" and "Strange Boy with a Hammer". The précis for a play is titled "Trade". ==References== Category:Canadian novellas Category:Canadian short story collections Category:Books by Leonard Cohen Category:McClelland & Stewart books

63758036	A Balloon Site, Coventry	A Balloon Site, Coventry is an oil-on-canvas painting undertaken in 1942 by the British artist Laura Knight. It portrays a group of people—mostly women—working to launch a barrage balloon on the outside of Coventry, an industrial city in the Midlands that was the target of a German bombing raid in November 1940, when over 10,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on the city. Knight had painted In for Repairs, showing members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) repairing a damaged barrage balloon, in early 1942. The Air Ministry was so impressed that they asked her to paint the WAAF in action. She was commissioned by the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC) and paid 100 guineas for the work, which was undertaken in July and August 1942. A Balloon Site was displayed at the 1943 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, along with Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring (1943). ==Background== From March 1939, Coventry had been protected by barrage balloons; the city was an industrial target and contained aircraft factories on the outskirts. The balloons were filled with hydrogen and were either set in fixed sites, or adapted for mobile deployment. They were fixed by steel cables which forced bombers to fly at a higher altitude than they would have preferred. In this way the bombing was less accurate, and the aeroplanes more vulnerable to ground-based anti- aircraft fire. The protection was not infallible, and, on 14 November 1940 Coventry was the target of a German bombing raid when over 10,000 incendiary bombs were dropped on the city. From April 1941 women were used to operate the balloons, a crew of fourteen women replacing the ten men that did so previously. ==History== During the Second World War the British government formed the War Artists' Advisory Committee (WAAC) under the chairmanship of Sir Kenneth Clark, the director of the National Gallery. The committee was "to draw up a list of artists qualified to record the war at home and abroad". One of those commissioned on several occasions was the British painter Laura Knight, who had painted for the Canadian government during the First World War. By early 1942 she had painted four pictures for the WAAF; the most recent was In for Repairs, showing members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAF) repairing a damaged barrage balloon. The Air Ministry was impressed with the picture and its potential to help with recruiting. The Ministry asked the WAAF if Knight could be commissioned again, and, in October 1941, she received a request from Mr Dickey, the Secretary of the WAAC, to paint members of the Women's Auxiliary Air Force based at RAF Wythall—the regional headquarters of RAF Balloon Command—which was from Birmingham. She worked on the piece in July and August 1942, and was paid 100 guineas for the work. A Balloon Site was displayed at the 1943 Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, as was Ruby Loftus Screwing a Breech Ring, a painting Knight had just completed. Both works were warmly received. As at , the painting is held by the Imperial War Museum. ==Painting== A Balloon Site is an oil painting on canvas measuring . It shows the launch of a barrage ballon on the outskirts of Coventry. In the middle distance are several damaged buildings, and the partial ruins of Coventry shown in the background. In the foreground two groups work on launching the balloon. The group in the foreground—composed of three women and a man—are under the leadership of Jean Brydon, a female sergeant. A second group are shown on the far side of the balloon. According to the art historians Teresa Grimes, Judith Collins and Oriana Baddeley, A Balloon Site and In For Repairs "are about activity, the concentration and absorption in work generated by a group endeavour are central to their composition". ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== ===Sources=== ====Books==== * * * * * * * * * ====Journals and magazines==== * ====News==== * ====Websites==== * * Category:1942 paintings Category:British women in World War II Category:Paintings in the Imperial War Museum Category:Cultural history of World War II Category:Paintings by Laura Knight Category:Portraits of women Category:United Kingdom home front during World War II Category:War paintings Category:Women in the United Kingdom Category:Cultural depictions of British women Category:Balloons (aeronautics) Category:Aviation art

62052131	A Banca	A Banca (Portuguese for "The Stand") was a very short-lived Brazilian alternative rock band from Santos, São Paulo, composed mostly by former Charlie Brown Jr. members and described as a "spiritual successor" of it. ==History== Following the break-up of Charlie Brown Jr., caused by the death of vocalist Chorão due to a cocaine overdose on March 6, 2013, the remaining members of the band (guitarists Thiago Castanho and Marcão, drummer Bruno Graveto and bassist Champignon) decided to form a new musical project that would serve as a tribute act both to Charlie Brown Jr. and Chorão, dubbing it "A Banca" (literally translated to English as "The Stand") in allusion to a Brazilian street slang referring to a gathering of friends – i.e., "Charlie Brown Jr.'s friends". (Coincidentally, "A Banca" is also the name of a song by Charlie Brown Jr. from their 2000 album Nadando com os Tubarões.) The only bandmember not originally from Charlie Brown Jr. was bassist Helena "Lena" Papini. The band's first rehearsal was watched and approved by Chorão's son, and they made their official debut on Serginho Groisman's variety show Altas Horas on April 11, 2013. In May they announced their nationwide Chorão Eterno Tour in tribute to Chorão, in which they covered Charlie Brown Jr.'s greatest hits and also played new compositions. In August they released the single "O Novo Passo", chosen by Rolling Stone Brasil one of the best Brazilian songs of the year. The band played its final show in São Vicente in late August, and in early September vocalist Champignon announced that their first full-length album was scheduled to be released in early 2014. Despite their apparent success, ever since its inception A Banca was overshadowed by controversy; a parcel of Charlie Brown Jr. fans criticized Champignon for "not respecting Chorão's death" and "not mourning it properly", going to the point of dismissing him as a "cash-grabber", a "traitor" and a "Judas". Even though Champignon always vehemently denied such claims, constant criticism eventually lead him to sink into a major depression, and on September 9, 2013, he committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a .380 ACP pistol, effectively ending A Banca. By 2014 the remaining members of A Banca (Castanho excepted) formed a new project, D'Chapas, alongside vocalist Ivan Sader, and with Pinguim Ruas (also a former member of Charlie Brown Jr.), Papini and Marcão formed Bula. Papini left Bula in late 2019. ==Discography== ===Single=== Year Single Album 2013 "O Novo Passo" Non-album song ==Members== * Champignon – vocals, beatboxing (2013; died 2013) * Marcão – electric guitar (2013) * Thiago Castanho – electric guitar (2013) * Bruno Graveto – drums (2013) * Helena "Lena" Papini – bass guitar (2013) ==References== Category:Musical groups established in 2013 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2013 Category:2013 establishments in Brazil Category:2013 disestablishments in Brazil Category:Musical groups from São Paulo (state) Category:Musical quintets Category:Brazilian alternative rock groups Category:Brazilian rap rock groups Category:Skate punk groups Category:Reggae rock groups Category:Brazilian pop rock music groups Category:Rapcore groups Category:Funk rock musical groups Category:Tribute bands

9938275	A Band Called David	A Band Called David was a group of musicians who provided the instrumental support from 1974 until 1988 for the 2nd Chapter of Acts, a contemporary Christian music group. The members of the band, without a name, played informally together and attended The Church on the Way in Van Nuys, California, where they met 2nd Chapter of Acts, who also attended there.The Frame Never Outdid the Picture: The 2nd Chapter of Acts Story They chose their name because of a sermon by Pastor Jack W. Hayford describing David as a man after God's heart, as seeking God's heart was an important motivation of the members of the band. The name of the band was always in lower case to take the emphasis off of themselves and keep it on the 2nd Chapter of Acts. The original members of the band were bass guitarist Herb Melton, keyboardist Richard Souther, guitarists Rick Azim and Paul Offenbacher, and drummer Gene Gunnels, who had played with the psychedelic bubblegum band Strawberry Alarm Clock on their hit record "Incense and Peppermints" in 1967. (He left Strawberry Alarm Clock for two years and rejoined them from 1969 to 1971.) Azim and Offenbacher were replaced by Peter York. Gunnels left the band in 1980 and Jack Kelly joined as a member until the 2nd Chapter of Acts stopped touring in 1988. Kelly had previously substituted for Gunnels, when Gunnels took time off from touring in 1975. Richard Souther left in the early 1980s and was replaced by Greg Springer.Information confirmed by email responses from Herb Melton and Gene Gunnels a band called David were credited as such on three recordings, To the Bride with Barry McGuire and 2nd Chapter of Acts (1975) and How the West Was One with 2nd Chapter of Acts and Phil Keaggy (1977), both albums released on Myrrh Records, and Mansion Builder (1978) released on Sparrow Records. They also performed without attribution on the 1983 Sparrow release by 2nd Chapter of Acts with Michael and Stormie Omartian, Together Live. As of 2008, York is president of EMI CMG Label Group. After recovering from a near-fatal illness in the early 1980s, Souther moved on to recording instrumental music and record producing. He is perhaps best known for his collaboration with Twila Paris on her Dove Award-winning album Sanctuary. ==References== Category:Christian rock groups from California Category:Musical groups established in 1974
40011318	A Band Called Death	A Band Called Death is a 2012 American documentary film directed by Mark Christopher Covino and Jeff Howlett. The documentary is about the 1970s rock band Death, and their new-found popularity decades after the group recorded their music. The film premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival in 2012 and was well received by film critics. ==Synopsis== A Band Called Death is the story of three musician brothers, born to a Baptist preacher and his wife in 1950s Detroit. In their teenage years, the three brothers (to five other siblings) emerge as, first, a budding rock/funk band, heavily influenced by Motown & Parliament, ultimately evolving into pioneers of punk music, Death. Influenced by music by Alice Cooper and The Who, the group was heavily steered by the guidance and decisions of visionary eldest brother and guitarist, David Hackney. The story follows the brothers' unsuccessful attempts to get radio airplay and a record deal, largely due to David's adamant refusal to change the name from Death. An eventual trek east finds the boys in Burlington, Vermont, living with relatives and reflecting on the failure of David's vision. We begin to explore post-Death projects in The 4th Movement, a gospel/rock band with the same line-up. However, after two years of being homesick, David returns to Detroit, leaving Dannis and Bobby to form a lively reggae band called Lambsbread. The film also focuses on the intense brotherly bond between the group members, and their personal lives, including David Hackney's battle with alcoholism, his death in 2000 and his family members' reactions to these events. The film follows the re-discovery of the group through record collectors leading to an eventual release of Death's album ...For the Whole World to See by the Drag City record label and the group's eventual reunion and touring with a new guitarist. ==Production== Director Jeff Howlett met Bobby Hackney Sr. and Dannis Hackney in the 1990s at a local music festival where his band and their band, Lambsbread, were playing. Bobby Hackney Jr. had formed his own band Rough Francis with his brothers to honor his father's band Death. After Howlett saw the show, he was impressed with the music and with Bobby Jr. and his father, and they began working on the documentary. In 2008, Mark Covino met Howlett while working on a video that Howlett was directing. The next year, Howlett approached Covino to work on the film with him, but Covino was initially hesitant about helping Howlett as he was attempting to finish his own documentary feature at the time. He changed his mind after reading an article in The New York Times on the group and hearing the two songs from the "Politicians in my Eyes" 7" single. Covino spent months organizing and scanning photos from members of the groups family from Vermont, Ohio and Detroit. Very little video footage of the group's guitarist David Hackney surfaced during their duo's research. ==Release== A Band Called Death had its world premiere at the 2012 Los Angeles Film Festival on June 16. It was acquired by Drafthouse Films shortly before screening at South By Southwest in 2013. The film was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 13, 2013. ==Reception== Initial critical response to A Band Called Death was positive. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the film has received an average score of 77, based on 14 reviews. ==Notes== ==External links== * * * Category:2012 documentary films Category:2012 films Category:2010s American films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about African Americans Category:Documentary films about Michigan Category:Documentary films about punk music and musicians Category:Documentary films about Vermont Category:Films produced by Scott Mosier
27997071	A Band Called O	A Band Called O were a band from Jersey, Channel Islands. Originally known as The Parlour Band, playing progressive rock, they renamed to A Band Called O for two albums on CBS/Epic and later to The O Band for further albums with UA. Despite issuing five albums, on three major labels, and being championed by John Peel, for whom they recorded four Peel Sessions, they had no chart success; but were a popular live act, who toured Britain and Europe. ==The Parlour Band== Formed in Jersey, Channel Islands, circa 1970, as 'The Parlour Band', the early 1970 line-up comprised founding member Peter Filleul (keyboards and vocals) formerly of the Climax Blues Band , with Mike Harwood (lead guitar and vocals) Allen Greenall (acoustic guitar and vocals) Nigel Uren (Drums) John Ashworth (Bass guitar) later replaced by Jeff Smith (Bass and vocals) the last 4 members were replaced in late 1970 by brothers Mark Anders (bass and vocals) and Craig Anders (lead guitar and vocals) Jon "Pix" Pickford (guitar and vocals) and Jerry Robbins (drums). Released in 1972, The Parlour Band's only album Is a Friend?, was produced by Nick Tauber in a melodic progressive rock style, sounding like a "more mainstream, less art- rock-inclined Yes" with strong keyboard and guitar parts. The Parlour Band toured supporting Caravan and Steve Hillage’s Khan. They relocated from Jersey to Leicester, changed their name to 'A Band Called O', and their drummer to Derek Ballard. This line-up released their first album on the Epic label, produced by Ben Sidran of the Steve Miller Band, and Chris White of The Zombies. A Band Called O (1974) and, despite being an album orientated band, a single "Rock and Roll Clown" / "Red Light Mama Red Hot" was released in Germany while they recorded the first of four Peel Sessions on 24 September 1974. They recorded their second Peel Session on 18 March 1975, before touring with Man and John Cipollina. Later that year, they released their second album, Oasis. They had one track "There Ain't Nothing I Wouldn't Do" on a single to promote their tour with Sassafras and Randy Pie as the 'Hot on the Tracks' package. Filleul left and was replaced by Ian Lynne, after about 6 months he was also replaced by Jeff Bannister, formerly with the John Barry Seven, The Alan Bown Set and Jess Roden’s Bronco. ==The O Band== The band changed label from CBS/Epic to United Artists, and played their third Peel Session on 23 March 1976 (the BBC credit all the Peel sessions to A Band Called O, although one or two were after the name change). Musically, their style had already evolved from progressive rock to soft-rock, but it then moved towards a pop style. They changed their name to 'The O Band' and released their third album Within Reach later that year. A promotional single "Excerpts from Within Reach" was issued in the UK whilst two singles were taken from the album: "A Smile Is Diamond" / "Coasting" was issued in Germany, and "Don't Cha Wanna" / "Coasting" in the UK. They played their fourth and final Peel Session on 22 February 1977. Also in 1977 they released a 12" EP Look to the Left, Look to the Right, before recording their final album The Knife, from which the single "Almost Saturday Night" / "Love Ain't a Keeper" was taken. Shortly before a planned change of management, Pix Pickford decided to leave for a solo career. The O Band later disbanded at the end of 1977. On the Road 1975-77 was released in June 2012 on CD (78 minutes) and as a download (118 minutes). Strangely, for a band known for its live performances, "this is the only live material ever released by the band". ==Unrelated O-Band== Since 2008 the name "The O Band" has been used by an unrelated Jazz, Hip-Hop, R&B; and Gospel band from Norfolk, Virginia. There is also music band from Ukraine called Band O (Гурт О) ==Subsequent careers== * Craig Anders later played with Alan Ross and Charlie Dore. * Mark Anders now runs Bug Music. * Derek Ballard went on to work with Razar, Charlie Dore, Bram Tchaikovsky and John Watts. In 1982 he moved to Germany and works in Berlin as a session musician and photographer. * Filleul rejoined the Climax Blues Band and later became a session musician recording with numerous artists including, Loudon Wainwright III, The Blues Band and Richard Thompson, adding composing, mixing and production work to his keyboard playing. * Pix Pickford had a brief solo career, releasing two singles: "Long Drop" and "Are you Rockin'", before moving to Spain to play with 'Racket' comprising Pickford, Nik Ramsey and Arturo Tore. Later, after a personnel change the band became 'Guiri', which saw Tore being replaced by Nigel Barrett on bass/vocals and for a while included Mike Smith on guitar and Blue Weaver on piano and keyboards. After Weaver and Smith's departure, Stefan Wickenden joined the band on guitar/vocals and this continued to be the line-up. Pickford lived in Torre del Mar, and was found dead in Spain, in September 2021, after going missing on 29 August following a meal with friends.

11143371	A Band in Hope	A Band in Hope (formerly The Mad Silentist) is the third studio album by The Matches and was released in Australia and Europe on March 15, 2008, and in the US on March 18, 2008. Audio production was handled by Tim Armstrong, Mike Green, John Feldmann, Nick Hexum, Miles Hurwitz, John Paulsen and Paul Ruxton.A Band in Hope (CD liner notes). The Matches. Los Angeles: Epitaph Records. 2008. 86938-2. Like their previous album Decomposer, A Band in Hope features multiple producers, though fewer this time around. According to frontman Shawn Harris' blog, the album was created in a period of despair due to the record sales of Decomposer. Instead of following up with the sister album titled The Mad Silentist, the band scrapped many of the old songs (only four remain in the final cut) and re-wrote the album. The new album, as Harris states, sways between hope and despair, and the hope one gets when they feel disillusioned and abandoned. ==Release information== On March 11, 2008, the Matches released the entire album on their MySpace page, and were featured on the MySpace front page. The next day the video for the first single "Wake the Sun" was released exclusively on Yahoo! Music. The video for "Yankee in a Chip Shop" was supposed to debut on MySpace Music on August 29, 2008. However, due to issues with the London Metropolitan Police that singer/guitarist Shawn Harris detailed in a blog post, including police that Harris were "rent-a- cops" who took the band members' names and had CCTV tapes of the band "running down the middle of the huge roundabout at Piccadilly Circus that was the video's finale", the video was removed shortly after its posting.

In the beginning, the band performed songs by local composers, and since then, it has begun to adapt such songs to its own musical style. A Banda Mais Bonita da Cidade has performed publicly at the Wonka Bar in Curitiba, where its lead singer, Uyara Torrente, put on a show called "A Saudade Mata Gente, Panaca" ("Longing Kills People, Fool"). ==Oração== The video clip for "Oração" was filmed as a long take on February 6, 2011, in a hundred-year-old house in Rio Negro, Paraná. In the clip, the song's composer, Leo Fressato, is filmed in real time as he sings and walks through the house with a microphone. Along the way, he encounters the band's musicians, who play their instruments and accompany him in singing. "Oração" is essentially a six- minute repetition of a chorus with four strophes. The video clip was released on May 13, 2011, and due to the music's catchy rhythm and simple message (a series of metaphors about the heart), it rapidly went viral in online social networks. ===Influence=== A Banda Mais Bonita da Cidade has stated that the video for "Oração" was influenced by the music video for "Nantes", a 2007 song by American band Beirut. ==Media response== On May 18, 2011, MTV named "Oração" video clip of the week. In the following days, both Brazilian and international news media published stories on the band, and many, including Globo, UOL, The Washington Post, and NPR, posted copies of "Oração" on their websites. Some Brazilian press sources have reported that A Banda Mais Bonita da Cidade appears to be at the center of a local indie rock movement in Curitiba called Novos Curitibanos (New Curitibans), which is similar to the São Paulo movement Novos Paulistas (New Paulistas). The latter movement is well known in Brazil due to the fame of many of its participating musicians, including Tulipa Ruiz, Dudu Tsuda (former member of Pato Fu), Tiê, and Thiago Pethit (winner of the MTV Bet Award at the 2010 MTV Video Music Brazil). Within a week of its launch on YouTube, "Oração" inspired several tribute videos and parodies from fans and critics of the song. == Discography == * A Banda Mais Bonita da Cidade (2009) * Canções Que Vão Morrer no Ar – Compact Vinyl (2012) * O Mais Feliz da Vida (2013) * De Cima do Mundo Eu Vi o Tempo (2017) ==References== == External links == * Category:Brazilian indie rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 2009

929153	A Bao A Qu (album)	A Bao A Qu is a 4 track 10" EP by singer-songwriter Virginia Astley. The selection of 4 songs indicated her preferences for poetic and classical sounds as 3 of the 4 songs had a direct connection. The sleeve art and script are credited to the artiste. "We will meet them again" was a translation of a verse from the Kindertotenlieder, a series of poems by Friedrich Rückert used by Austrian composer Gustav Mahler for his song cycle of the same name, its meaning being "Songs On The Death Of Children". "Arctic Death" was inspired by the W. B. Yeats poem "An Irish Airman Foresees His Death" and also inspired the Catherine DeNeuve sleeve used for "Promise Nothing". "Sanctus" is a straight reading in Latin from the Requiem as used by Benjamin Britten in his War Requiem. It's also her only a cappella song, the other voices being Nicky Holland and her brother Jon Astley who co-produced the recordings. In 1999 a privately made CD was issued on the Astra label and added computerised sounds as "Sanctus 2000". "Angel Crying" is in the style of a Revivalist Hymn and features 2 members of the soon to be Big Country, then part of her cousin in law Simon Townshend's band On the Air. In fact this debut was something of a family affair as her nieces Emma and Aminta Townshend were backup singers. Other musicians involved were Josephine Wells of Kissing the Pink and Peter Hope Evans, ex-Medicine Head. After what could be called Virginia's Song Cycle Of Death she got it out of her system and moved on to other things, though her overall sound was to remain in the same turf for 2 decades. The album shares its name with a Malayan legend; at the time of composition, Virginia had recently read a book by Jorge Luis Borges which described the legend, and a great deal of her lyrics depended on what she'd been reading at the time.

2301932	A Bar at the Folies-Bergère	A Bar at the Folies-Bergère () is a painting by Édouard Manet, considered to be his last major work. It was painted in 1882 and exhibited at the Paris Salon of that year. It depicts a scene in the Folies Bergère nightclub in Paris. The painting originally belonged to the composer Emmanuel Chabrier, a close friend of Manet, and hung over his piano. It is now in the Courtauld Gallery in London. ==Painting== The painting exemplifies Manet's commitment to Realism in its detailed representation of a contemporary scene. Many features have puzzled critics but almost all of them have been shown to have a rationale, and the painting has been the subject of numerous popular and scholarly articles.Malcolm Park, Ambiguity, and the Engagement of Spatial Illusion within the Surface of Manet's Paintings (PhD diss., University of New South Wales, Australia, 2001).Thierry de Duve, "Intentionality and Art Historical Methodology: A Case Study". Nonsite.org Issue #6, July 1, 2012 ; builds and corrects previous work Thierry de Duve, How Manet's A Bar at the Folies-Bergere is Constructed, Critical Enquiry, Vol. 25, No. 1, Autumn 1998, pp. 136-168. The central figure stands before a mirror, although critics—accusing Manet of ignorance of perspective and alleging various impossibilities in the painting—have debated this point since the earliest reviews were published. In 2000, however, a photograph taken from a suitable point of view of a staged reconstruction was shown to reproduce the scene as painted by Manet."Manet's Bar at the Folies-Bergère: One Scholar's Perspective" , www.getty.edu. Retrieved July 20, 2012. According to this reconstruction, "the conversation that many have assumed was transpiring between the barmaid and gentleman is revealed to be an optical trick—the man stands outside the painter's field of vision, to the left, and looks away from the barmaid, rather than standing right in front of her." As it appears, the observer should be standing to the right and closer to the bar than the man whose reflection appears at the right edge of the picture. This is an unusual departure from the central point of view usually assumed when viewing pictures drawn according to perspective. right|thumb|300px|Study for (1881) Asserting the presence of the mirror has been crucial for many modern interpreters.Bradford R. Collins, ed., 12 Views of Manet's Bar, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1996 It provides a meaningful parallel with Las Meninas, a masterpiece by an artist Manet admired, Diego Velázquez. There has been a considerable development of this topic since Michel Foucault broached it in his book The Order of Things (1966).Foucault has given a talk on Manet's Bar at the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo on April 8, 1970. He had planned a book on Manet's painting and gave a series of lectures during 1970/1 but the project was abandoned; see Cahiers de L'Herne: Michel Foucault, mars 2011 The art historian Jeffrey Meyers describes the intentional play on perspective and the apparent violation of the operations of mirrors: "Behind her, and extending for the entire length of the four-and-a-quarter-foot painting, is the gold frame of an enormous mirror. The French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty has called a mirror 'the instrument of a universal magic that changes things into spectacles, spectacles into things, me into others, and others into me.' We, the viewers, stand opposite the barmaid on the other side of the counter and, looking at the reflection in the mirror, see exactly what she sees... A critic has noted that Manet's 'preliminary study shows her placed off to the right, whereas in the finished canvas she is very much the centre of attention.' Though Manet shifted her from the right to the center, he kept her reflection on the right. Seen in the mirror, she seems engaged with a customer; in full face, she's self-protectively withdrawn and remote."Jeffrey Meyers, Impressionist Quartet: The Intimate Genius of Manet and Morisot, Degas and Cassatt. New York: Harcourt, 2005. p. 77 The painting is rich in details which provide clues to social class and milieu. The woman at the bar is a real person, known as Suzon, who worked at the Folies-Bergère in the early 1880s. For his painting, Manet posed her in his studio. By including a dish of oranges in the foreground, Manet identifies the barmaid as a prostitute, according to art historian Larry L. Ligo, who says that Manet habitually associated oranges with prostitution in his paintings. T.J. Clark says that the barmaid is "intended to represent one of the prostitutes for which the Folies-Bergère was well-known", who is represented "as both a salesperson and a commodity—something to be purchased along with a drink."Doris Lanier, Absinthe, the Cocaine of the Nineteenth Century: A History of the Hallucinogenic Drug and Its Effect on Artists and Writers in Europe and the United States, McFarland, 2004, pp. 102–103. Other notable details include the pair of green feet in the upper left-hand corner, which belong to a trapeze artist who is performing above the restaurant's patrons. The beer bottles depicted are easily identified by the red triangle on the label as Bass Pale Ale, and the conspicuous presence of this British brand instead of German beer has been interpreted as documentation of anti-German sentiment in France in the decade after the Franco-Prussian War.Kenneth Bendiner, Food In Painting: From The Renaissance To The Present, Reaktion Books, 2004, pp. 73–74. ==Cultural references== The 1934 ballet Bar aux Folies-Bergère with choreography by Ninette de Valois and music of Chabrier was created from, and based around, Manet's painting.Rambert, Marie. Quicksilver: an autobiography. Papermac (Macmillan Publishers Ltd), London, 1983, p157. The 1947 film The Private Affairs of Bel Ami faithfully references A Bar at the Folies-Bergère twenty nine minutes into the film with a look- alike actress, set and props as the main characters enter the establishment. The painting was the inspiration of a song (possibly by Sydney Carter) in the popular theatre production The Lyric Revue, in London in 1951. The refrain went "Oh, how I long to be Back in my dear Brittany ... But fate has chosen me For the bar at the Folies-Bergères". The painting The Bar (1954) by Australian artist John Brack, which depicts a comparatively grim and austere Melbourne bar-room scene, is an ironic reference to A Bar at the Folies-Bergère. In the 1988 Eddie Murphy film Coming To America, a spoof on the painting in which the barmaids are dark-skinned women in red dresses and there is a hamburger on a plate on the counter, can be seen hanging at the McDowell residence. Canadian artist Jeff Wall makes reference to A Bar at the Folies-Bergère in his work Picture for Women (1979).Merritt, Naomi. "Manet's Mirror and Jeff Wall's Picture for Women: Reflection or Refraction?" Emaj (Electronic Melbourne Art Journal), Issue 4, 2009. Merritt discusses the role of the mirror in this work. The Tate Modern wall text for Picture for Women, from the 2005–2006 exhibition Jeff Wall Photographs 1978–2004, outlines the influence of Manet's painting: > In Manet's painting, a barmaid gazes out of frame, observed by a shadowy > male figure. The whole scene appears to be reflected in the mirror behind > the bar, creating a complex web of viewpoints. Wall borrows the internal > structure of the painting, and motifs such as the light bulbs that give it > spatial depth. The figures are similarly reflected in a mirror, and the > woman has the absorbed gaze and posture of Manet's barmaid, while the man is > the artist himself. Though issues of the male gaze, particularly the power > relationship between male artist and female model, and the viewer's role as > onlooker, are implicit in Manet's painting, Wall updates the theme by > positioning the camera at the centre of the work, so that it captures the > act of making the image (the scene reflected in the mirror) and, at the same > time, looks straight out at us.Gallery Guide text for the exhibition Jeff > Wall Photographs 1978–2004, Tate Modern, London, 21 October 2005 to 8 > January 2006 quoted in David Campany, "'A Theoretical Diagram in an Empty > Classroom': Jeff Wall's Picture for Women", Oxford Art Journal 20.1 (2007): > 12-14. ==See also== * List of paintings by Édouard Manet ==References and sources== References Sources * Gary Tinterow, et al.

42175589	A Barca	A Barca is an abandoned hamlet located in the municipality of Cortegada, Ourense, Galicia, Spain. It is located near the Minho River and the Portuguese border. It consists of twelve houses and measures around . ==History== The hamlet was founded in the 15th century. The site at A Barca was once part of the royal road to Castille, and the river Minho could be crossed by boat there. The hamlet derives its name from this, with barco meaning "boat" in Spanish. By the 1920s, the business of transporting people and goods from one side of the river to the other had collapsed due to the construction of a bridge nearby. The inhabitants then invested in the growing of grapes. ===Abandonment=== The building of the Frieira dam in the 1950s led to higher water levels and the flooding of the land near A Barca. The electricity company Unión Fenosa later bought out the hamlet residents. The construction of the dam, combined with the rerouting of trade routes, led to the abandonment of the village. On 14 January 2013, the company Gas Natural, successor to Unión Fenosa, gave ownership of the hamlet to the municipality. By the date of the transfer, the municipality already had plans for the hamlet to be turned into a tourist site. ===Sale=== As of March 2014, the whole hamlet is to be given away for free to a new owner who promises to redevelop the village and preserve the buildings, as the municipality lacks funds to do so. The mayor of Cortegada, Avelino Luis de Francisco Martínez, has said the municipality wishes to generate economic activity in the area by the sale of the hamlet. Since the hamlet was up for offer, there have been close to a thousand requests for information, but no serious candidates. The municipality is looking for a designation in the area of tourism. There have already been offers to construct a luxury resort, a clinic, a hippie community, a cheese factory and a meditation complex. The current twelve buildings, four of which have multiple floors, are currently in a state of disrepair with only walls still standing. Due to severe overgrowth of vegetation, the hamlet cannot be seen from the air. ==Transportation== The hamlet is only accessible by a non- paved path diverging from the road towards Celanova. ==References== Category:Geography of the Province of Ourense Category:Former populated places in Spain Category:Populated places in the Province of Ourense

20715108	A Barcelona	thumb|250px|right|A Barcelona by Jacint A Barcelona is a poem by Jacint Verdaguer, published in 1883. It is a triumphant song of the transformation undergone by Barcelona since the mid-19th century. Consisting of 46 quatrains of Alexandrine verses, and a re-editing process started in 1874 and completed in 1875, it is the fruit of a labour started in 1883. The author then lengthened and amended it three times, the last two shortly before its publication. ==Analysis== The first three stanzas present the city protected by the mountain of Montjuïc, identified with Alcides (Hercules), the mythic founder of Barcino according to a legend that Verdaguer had already picked up on in The Atlàntida (1878). Next are sixteen quatrains, in which the poet celebrates the demolition of the walls and the extension of the city (1859), with a prophecy of bursting growth, beyond the Collserola mountain range and the Besos and Llobregat rivers, as if "Paris of the Seine" had been transplanted to Catalonia. However, the three following stanzas, in the name of the homeland, reject any awe of the French capital, affirming instead the personality of Barcelona, which had been the Catalan center of a medieval Mediterranean empire and «She shone on Spanish lands as eastern star». In the 23rd to 40th stanzas, the poet evokes the historical characters and the monuments that distinguish the city. The six final stanzas, written from the perspective of the Cathedral, imaginatively transfigured into King Jaume I, formulate the ideological conclusion, the providential perspective, in which Barcelona and Catalonia are exhorted to promote economic progress, based on their industries, but without ever renouncing the Catholic tradition, since in the end «God alone brings down or lifts up peoples». ==Reception== In spite of the rhetorical flourishes denounced by some critics, the poem, rewarded with an extraordinary prize in the Floral Games (Jocs florals) of 1883, expresses faithfully the expectations of the elite of the period. This is confirmed by the fact that the Ajuntament (city council) published a popular edition of the poem, with a print run of 100,000 copies. On the other hand, the poem has also provoked numerous imitations and responses, noteworthy of which are the "New Ode to Barcelona" by Joan Maragall and the "Ode to Barcelona" by Pere Quart.Diccionari de la Literatura Catalana, 2008 The full, annotated text of the poem is included in Selected Poems of Jacint Verdaguer: A Bilingual Edition, edited and translated by Ronald Puppo, with an introduction by Ramon Pinyol Torrents, University of Chicago Press, 2007. ==See also== *"Oda nova a Barcelona", by Joan Maragall ==References== Category:Jacint Verdaguer Category:1883 poems Category:Barcelona in popular culture

8312349	A Barnstormer in Oz	A Barnstormer in Oz: A Rationalization and Extrapolation of the Split-Level Continuum is a 1982 novel by Philip José Farmer and is based on the setting and characters of L. Frank Baum's The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. The central character of the novel is Hank Stover, a pilot and the son of Dorothy Gale, who finds himself in Oz when his plane gets lost in a green cloud over Kansas in 1923. The Oz he discovers is on the brink of civil war; he encounters Erakna, the new Wicked Witch. Farmer takes an unusual approach to the corpus of Oz literature; he depends almost solely on Baum's original Oz book and neglects its many sequels. This "originalist" approach to the Oz mythos is rare but not unique; a few other writers have taken similar tacks, including Roger S. Baum, the great-grandson of L. Frank Baum. In Barnstormer, Dorothy has made only one visit to Oz; when Hank Stover arrives, the Scarecrow still rules the Emerald City, just as at the end of Baum's first Oz book. Since Farmer wrote for adults rather than children, there are elements of sex and violence in Barnstormer that are not typical of the Oz literature. As the book's subtitle indicates, Farmer indulges a rationalizing and explanatory bent: he treats Oz as a parallel universe in the science fiction vein. He attempts explanations and analyses of some of the fantastic elements in Baum's fictional world, including magic and talking animals. Literary scholars Kent Drummond, Susan Aronstein, and Terri L. Rittenburg have called it "the first instance of Dark Oz" and "the beginning of stand-alone, full-blown literary re-consumptions of Oz", specifying that it introduced the concept of "revisionist Oz, an Oz that purports to offer consumers the 'real Oz', the truth behind the myth."OZ GROWS UP, in The Road to Wicked: The Marketing and Consumption of Oz from L. Frank Baum to Broadway, by Kent Drummond, Susan Aronstein, and Terri L. Rittenburg; p. 143; published June 24, 2018, by Springer Publishing Opinions of Farmer's contribution to the literature of Oz span the entire critical spectrum; Jack Zipes called the novel "splendid",Jack David Zipes, Fairy Tale as Myth/Myth as Fairy Tale, Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 1994; p. 128. while Baum biographer Katharine Rogers considered it "revision to the point of debasement."Katharine M. Rogers, L. Frank Baum, Creator of Oz: A Biography, New York, Macmillan, 2002; p. 252.

As he opens an oven and takes out a roast turkey, a slightly irritated farmer confronts him. Though Krazy puts back the dish in the oven, the farmer roughs up and hurls him outside. The farmer then calls out a rooster to put the cat to work. At the open, Krazy runs on a treadmill which spins a circular saw, and the rooster uses it to cut some logs in half. After cutting the wood, the hostile rooster "piles" the logs at a wall of the house in a way of trying hit Krazy with them. Krazy, however, is able to dodge everything being hurled at him. When the rooster viciously approaches, Krazy runs, and the fowl chases. Upon running, Krazy squeezes himself into a small hole in a fence which the cat is able to pass through. The rooster attempts the same act, only to be stuck midway. Following his work with the rooster, Krazy, for some reason, milks a cow. He then befriends a duckling, and pours the milk into a hole in the ground which the duckling swims in. After spending time with the duckling, Krazy heads to another location where he takes a sock and plays it like an accordion. A pair of hens come and dance with him. They like his performance a lot that they collapse in amusement. The farmer then comes into the open, and is surprised to see the rooster who is still stuck in the fence. Further annoyed, the farmer chases Krazy beyond the farm, and even tosses rocks. Krazy runs from the farmer until he reaches a cliff. Without any other place to go, Krazy jumps off and dives into the sea below. The farmer jumps in too. Underwater, Krazy takes a rock to disguise himself as a turtle.

It belonged to an emerging movement of experimental independent theater companies located mainly in Lisbon. During 1976 the group spent most of its time touring the country. The Europa Year Book of 1983 listed it as one of the main Portuguese theater companies of the period following the Carnation Revolution of 25 April 1974. The group was described at the time as the most popular of the independent theater companies in Portugal. Maria do Céu Guerra and stage director and playwright Hélder Costa have managed the company since its foundation. Costa has written, transcribed and staged many of the shows presented by the group. During his time of exile in Lisbon, the Brazilian playwright Augusto Boal participated in directing the company. He left a strong influence on the group's repertoire. The actor Mário Viegas first appeared with the company. In 1976 the company moved to precarious facilities at the top of Rua Alexandre Herculano, near the Largo do Rato. In 1989 they were granted the Cinearte theater in Largo de Santos by the Lisbon City Council for a period of 25 years. The theater was also used as a cafe-concert space. On 4 March 2011 the theater group celebrated 35 years with a party that feted two of the leading figures in its history, Augusto Boal and the actress Fernanda Alves. Rita Lello put on a special staging of the play Angel City by Sam Shepard. == Theatrical productions== The theatrical productions of A Barraca are mainly adaptations of historical and political subjects to the popular, traditional and modern format of narrative theater. The company has a special focus on national production, due to the subsidies allocated to it by the state. A Barraca debuted in March 1976 in the Incrível Almadense theater with Cidade Dourada (Golden City) by La Candelária. This was a great success. In September of that year it mounted the show (Stories of Squires and Pimps) staged by Hélder Costa and based on scripts by Gil Vicente and Ruzante. In 1977 it presented the show Ao qu'isto chegou! - Feira portuguesa de opinião, including the drama A Lei É a Lei (The Law is the Law) by Luiz Francisco Rebello. When Augusto Boal was with the company in 1977–78 he directed three plays including Barraca conta Tiradentes (1977). In 1978 the company presented the piece José do Telhado about the famous Portuguese villain José do Telhado, with musical arrangements by Zeca Afonso. The music was released in 1979 as the album Fura, Fura. A Barraca produced some of its greatest successes in the 1980s. In 1980 it presented É menino ou menina? (Is it a boy or girl?), a collage of pieces by Gil Vicente arranged by Maria do Céu Guerra and directed by Helder Costa. The company made an interesting contribution to the history of representations of works by Gil Vicente. In the same year the group first visited Brazil. It showed Preto no branco, a version of Accidental Death of an Anarchist by Dario Fo. The repertoire also included D. João VI by Hélder Costa. Mário Viegas played the sovereign and caused much amusement by his interpretation of the king as a chicken eater, who walked around with pieces of poultry in his pockets. The group was described as a "large international theater company" during its limited engagement in Rio de Janeiro. In 1983 the company presented Um dia na capital do Império (One day in the capital of the Empire), with a script by António Ribeiro Chiado and staging by Hélder Costa. In 1984 A Barraca produced Santa Joana dos Matadouros (Saint Joan of the Stockyards) by Bertolt Brecht, considered one of the greatest successes of the company, and in 1986 produced Calamity Janes, with a highly acclaimed interpretation by Maria do Céu Guerra. In September 2010 A Barraca was asked to re-enact the play O Mistério da Camioneta Fantasma (The Mystery of the Phantom Coach) as part of the official program for the Centenary Celebration of the Republic. On 20 July 2011 the group debuted the production D. Maria, a Louca (Maria the Mad), with script by the Brazilian author António Cunha and staging by Maria do Céu Guerra. On 10 April 2013 the A Barraca company debuted Menino de Sua Avó (His Grandmother's Boy), an unpublished text by the playwright Armando Nascimento Rosa, a creation of Maria do Céu Guerra and Adérito Lopes. This production was included in the closing celebrations of the Year of Portugal in Brazil, performed in the Teatro Dulcina in Rio de Janeiro on 3, 4 and 5 May 2013 . ==Presentations== Many of the productions of the company have been Hélder Costa's own plays: * Zé do Telhado * Príncipe de Spandau * D.

The first edition was a library binding with 180 pages. WorldCat Identities contains records of seven editions of this book in 765 libraries worldwide There is a musical adaptation of the book with music by Julia Adolphe and libretto by Stephanie Fleischmann ==Synopsis== A Barrel of Laughs, a Vale of Tears follows the young prince Roger, who haphazardly sets out on a quest to prepare himself to become king. The book expresses the emotions of various individuals through two long-lost lovers reunited, several unlikely couples marrying, and a friend-turned-evil's attempts for revenge. While Roger himself starts out as pure and innocent, he seems somewhat naive and incapable of feeling serious. The quest, which contains plenty of sad events, gradually brings Roger to a point where he still is humorous, but is caring about specific individuals as opposed to finding shallow humor in everything. The beautiful Princess Petulia, and her servant, likewise, find similar changes in personality through their experiences, as they go from being bitterly indifferent to loving and plainspoken to kinder respectively. ==Publication history== * * * * * * * (German language) ==References== Category:American children's novels Category:1995 American novels Category:1995 fantasy novels Category:Children's fantasy novels Category:HarperCollins books Category:Works by Jules Feiffer Category:1995 children's books Category:Children's books about princes Category:Novels about royalty

In 2011, the book was released in the Netherlands, under the name Engelen van Apocalyps. == Plot == In the distant past, the Celestial Paradise was the scene of a terrible uprising. A group of warrior angels, lovers of justice and freedom, challenged the tyranny of the powerful archangels, raising arms against their oppressors. Expelled, the renegades were forced into exile, and condemned to wander the world of men until the final judgement. But then comes the moment of Revelation, the time of reckoning, the day of the awakening of the Most High. Ablon, sole survivor of the purge and leader of the renegades, is invited by Lucifer, to join his legions in the battle of Armageddon, the final struggle between Heaven and Hell, the war that will decide not only the fate of the world, but the future of the universe. From the ruins of Babylon to the splendour of the Roman Empire, from the vast plains of China to the frozen castles in medieval England. A Batalha do Apocalipse is not just a journey through human history, but also a journey of knowledge, an exciting epic, full of heroic struggles, magic, romance and suspense. == The Book == A constant journey between past, present and future the author begins the book introducing us to two important characters of his story: the archangels Michael and Uzziel. In that first moment he begins to present the personality of Michael and the context in which his story unfolds, God, soon after the creation on the seventh day - where the Bible refers to the time of your rest Livro de Gêneses, Bíblia Sagrada \- enters a sleep deeper and you awake, supposedly the day of Judgement. Mankind then falls under the "guide" of the Archangels and their subordinates, the angels. There are five Archangels: Michael, the prince of the angels, heir to that title by being the firstborn. Uziel, commander of the armies of cherubim. Rafael, who was exiled after the fight of his brothers archangels. Gabriel, Master of Fire, rebelled against Archangel Michael. And, Lucifer, the morning star. As might be expected, Lucifer naturally craved the throne of his brother and it is around that nebulous plot that the course of the story takes place, as the rivalry between the two brothers is the main character of the book. The former general of the cherubim, Ablon, comes to us in Rio de Janeiro, in the near future, in the "hands of the Creator",A batalha do Apocalipse, Spohr, E., 2010 i.e., standing in the hands of Christ the Redeemer. He meets his friend Orion, former King of Atlantis and current servant of Lucifer, who comes to propose a truce. Ablon's rival Apollyon is a deadly protagonist. == Characters == * Archangel Michael: The Prince of angels, and the most radical of them. Later the leader of the archangels. He defeated the armies of Lucifer and drove them to Sheol. * Ablon, the Renegade Angel or also called First General: The protagonist of the book. Over the years on earth, Ablon traveled through diverse corners of the world, always escaping from various dangers. At the present moment of the book, Ablon is in Brazil, in the city of Rio de Janeiro, and becomes the leader of a great gathering of angels. * Lucifer, the Morning Star or the Son of the Dawn: After revolting against his brother Michael, today he has his own kingdom in the depths of Hell. * Archangel Gabriel, The Master of the Fire or Messenger: He came too close to human beings, and therefore he adhered to their cause. Like Lucifer, he also revolted against Michael, but for less selfish motives. * Archangel Raphael, the Cure of God: Being the kindest of the archangels, in the time of the deluge, he disappeared from paradise, causing everyone to believe that he had descended to the earth to live as a mortal. * Archangel Uziel, the Golden Marshal: The youngest among the archangels. Commander of the order of the cherubim (the soldiers of God). * Apollyon, the Destroying Angel: Lucifer's favourite warrior. When he fell with him, he became one of the nine Dukes of Hell. * Shamira, the Witch of En-Dor: Having been trained early in the arts of magic and necromancy, Shamira met Ablon when he saved her from her persecutors in Babylon. Since then, both have been helping each other as they can each time they meet. * Amael, the Lord of the Volcanoes: After helping the Archangel Michael to create the biblical flood, he repented and ended up following Lucifer and falling in Sheol. To this day he cries fervent tears for the atrocities he committed. * Flower-of- the-East: Daughter of Chinese nobles. Her tongue was cut off and she was sold after a revolution. She is a great help to the Witch of En-Dor in saving the Ablon from death. == Important Places == Heavenly Palace: the stronghold of the archangels in the Fifth Heaven, the most central and important point of the heavenly paradise. Fortress of Zion: the greatest bastion of the forces of the archangel Michael out of the sky. Located in the ethereal plane, under the worldly city of Jerusalem. Citadel of Fire: the First region of Heaven which is the meeting point of ishins. It was ruled by Amael, then by Aziel, and later became the headquarters of Gabriel and the new rebels. Tsafon, Mount of the Congregation: the highest region of the Seventh Heaven where God was asleep. Sheol: the dimension where the remains of Tehom and the gods of darkness were buried. It later served as home to Lucifer and his fallen angels, becoming known as Hell. Castle of Light: the main stronghold of the cherubim, located in the Fourth Heaven. == Summary == In Aurora the ages there has always been good and evil, which was destroyed by God along with their archangels created for the purpose of governing and protecting the earth. Long before the creation of man, God created the Archangels and soon the angels to serve and protect his creation. 7 days say they are very well explained in this book where each day was summed up in a million years, which led to the creation of the world we live in today. At the end of the sixth day, God was tired, and "fell asleep" at Mount Tsafon and let the angels and archangels to take care of all his creation, especially man, created in his image and likeness. After the creation of men, still live on the seventh day, which God is asleep and we are governed by angels. In the glory days, the Archangel Michael, the first created by God, the eldest son, he felt diminished, and blinded by envy and jealousy by humans, ordered mass destruction, but was barred by the legion of warriors, 18 renegade angels, led by Ablon, hero of this book. These angels were sentenced to 18 Haled (earth) and trapped in their avatars and forever pursued by warriors Miguel, until they are killed because they were considered traitors of heaven and condemned to live humans stuck together that both defended until the end of time, the end of the seventh day, the Day of Reckoning where God and awaken your universe exilaria those who were against their will. Lucifer also made a revolution, claiming to defend human but it was just jealousy for his brother what motivated him, making him take Sheol (hell) and third heaven, where there was created the refuge of evil, for which all unjust and malicious would be sent. And so begins the era of a hero, the protagonist of this book that involves romance, mystery, action, fiction and mysteries never before revealed. Ablon goes through various adventures, hovering past and present in which is supported by the witch of Endor (Shamira) which saved him from the hands of the tyrant king of Babylon, destroyed himself. Remembering here that even before Lucifer was exiled renegade angels existed, which is different from Lucifer, the fallen angel. After various adventures experienced by Ablon, finally comes the time of the Day of Reckoning, the famous Battle of Armageddon which will decide the future of humanity, the planet and all the beings that inhabit it. It is the legendary battle between the defender of humanity and the Archangel Michael, overcome by jealousy and greed, which led to him being the most tyrannical of all the universe, trying to match up to God who in his sick mind believed was his destiny.http://mundodoslivros8.blogspot.com/2013/02/a-batalha-do- apocalipse.html Ablon, when he discovers that Ishatar (his partner renegade) was murdered by Black Angel, gets mad and blind with rage, but she was dead on behalf of a secret that would change the entire fate of the universe, a secret which Ablon only discover at the last breath of his life. The book of Revelation Battle involves mysteries never revealed. It's like reading the Apocalypse, but in an innovative language and full of answers. == Reviews == "There is nothing in known Portuguese literature that resembles the Battle of the Apocalypse." - José Louzeiro, writer and screenwriter == Movie == Several book fans believed that the work would receive an adjustment to the theaters because of its great success in Brazil and abroad. However, no company decided to acquire their rights, and work only followed in bookstores. ==References== Category:Brazilian fantasy novels Category:2010 novels

60412308	A Bath Full of Ecstasy	A Bath Full of Ecstasy is the seventh studio album by English synth-pop group Hot Chip. It was released on 21 June 2019, and was co-produced by Hot Chip, Philippe Zdar, and Rodaidh McDonald, marking the first time the group worked with outside producers. The album was preceded by the singles "Hungry Child" and "Melody of Love". It is one of the final albums released with production credits from Zdar – alongside his band Cassius' final studio album Dreems, released on the same day – as he died two days before its release, on 19 June. ==Writing and recording== Preliminary songwriting for A Bath Full of Ecstasy was undertaken by Hot Chip members Alexis Taylor and Joe Goddard, and first traces back to work they did for pop singer Katy Perry. After she asked them to help with songwriting for her 2017 album Witness, the duo spent four days at Air Studios collaborating with her. Goddard called it "incredibly exciting" and said: "I loved writing for somebody else. She was great, very funny and easygoing". One of the songs they wrote, "Into Me You See", ended up on her album, while two others, "Spell" and "Echo", were re-worked by Hot Chip for A Bath Full of Ecstasy. Felix Martin said, "We ended up with the leftover bits they'd written, being very much obvious pop stuff, and those songs ended up being something more interesting than that." Taylor and Goddard also recorded demos at Goddard's studio in East London. When the members of Hot Chip re- convened to record A Bath Full of Ecstasy, they decided to work with outside producers for the first time and to allow them to have a say in the songwriting. The decision was born out of the band's desire to take a different approach than they had on previous records, and to have someone push them creatively. Martin said, "We all recognize you need to set new challenges and put yourself in slightly different positions in order to provoke a different response artistically." Goddard said that the group also wanted someone who would present additional choices of equipment for them to use beyond what they already owned. After meeting with several producers, the band chose to work with Philippe Zdar of French musical duo Cassius, as well as Rodaidh McDonald. Initially, collaborating with outsiders caused some friction. Whereas Taylor and Goddard were open to McDonald challenging them to write better songs, band member Al Doyle had some difficulty trusting "the people [they] were working with were making better decisions than [they] would make as a band". Doyle said he needed to acclimate himself to McDonald's style, as the producer worked entirely on a computer, whereas Doyle was "more traditional and old-fashioned". Though Taylor was eager to follow the producers' direction, he said that in a few instances, he decided to follow his instincts and disregard their suggestions. The two producers had very different styles. McDonald, who Martin described as "mild-mannered", "analytical", and "goal-oriented", brought a pop-centric mindset and deliberated about the song structures. He recommended to the group where to add bridges, choruses, and hooks, how many bars they should last, and he considered how the songs should be edited differently for radio or streaming services. Goddard said of McDonald, "He was quite ruthless – 'is this verse too long? Do we have to write something stronger? We should get to the chorus faster.' He pushed us to be more ambitious." Martin said the producer was very honest and never afraid to suggest changes if he thought the songs could be improved, which included urging lyrical rewrites. He described McDonald as having an editor's mindset, in that "he would always look to make songs work better in a shorter, more punchy way." Goddard said he was "really amazing at structuring the songs, so that it's very not overstaying its welcome". The band worked with McDonald in London. Zdar, on the other hand, was more interested in fostering a collaborative atmosphere in the studio amongst the band members and capturing the moments of "fun improvisation". Contrasting with his counterpart, Zdar believed in long edits of tracks instead of making short pop songs. Taylor said Zdar had a knack for spotting the vocal melodies and hooks in songs, and his mixes emphasised them while also giving "more space in the music". Taylor also enjoyed the unfamiliar equipment and instruments that Zdar offered the group, helping them deviate from familiar habits. Goddard called him "bold and passionate" and praised his skills at "working with bass, making records feel really full and alive". He said the producer's "sense of joy and wonder at the world" helped instill the group with more confidence. They worked with Zdar at his studio, Motorbass Studios, in Montmartre, Paris. Goddard credited the band members' musical pursuits outside of Hot Chip with improving them as a band, saying that they honed their skills "either as a musician or a producer, an arranger or a live player". He cited Doyle as an example, saying he had strengthened his guitar and bass guitar playing due to his experience performing with LCD Soundsystem on tour. Approximately 20 songs were in consideration to be included on the album. Martin said that if decision of the track listing has been left entirely to the band members, the album would have comprised 10–12 songs, but they received advice from the record label and producers to keep it more concise. ==Release and promotion== The band announced the album on 4 April 2019, publishing the artwork, track listing, and release date, as well as concert tour dates. The news was accompanied by the release of the record's lead single, "Hungry Child", and its music video. A second single, "Melody of Love", was released on 29 May 2019, along with a music video. A Bath Full of Ecstasy was released on 21 June 2019 in several formats. A standard edition of the record was released on vinyl, CD, and in digital formats. A deluxe edition was released on two vinyl records, with a pressing on transparent orange and turquoise discs, a black and white sleeve, and autographs of the band members. The album artwork was designed by Jeremy Deller and graphic designer Fraser Muggeridge. ==Reception== Will Hodgkinson of The Times called A Bath Full of Ecstasy "as warm and appealing as its title suggests". He said the album would be merely escapist if "not for the melancholic undertow of the melodies and the empathy of the lyrics, making this beautiful album a summer soundtrack with depth". Roisin O'Connor of The Independent called the album Hot Chip's best, saying they "offer up some of their most poignant phrases to date". The review concluded, "For all its glimmering synths and the robotic pathos of Taylor's idiosyncratic vocals, this is a record with both heart and soul." Damien Morris of The Observer said the album saw "the band's gift for melody and grasp of pop's dynamics tweaked into transcendent shapes" by Zdar and McDonald. He opined that the group sound their best when delving into "the comforting predictability of that pulsing beat" of house music. Pitchforks Jonah Bromwich said, "it's compulsively listenable, oddly moving, and stranger than it first appears, as the band gets existential on the dance floor." He thought the album was most effective when the producers pushed the group beyond their comfort zone, and despite some "truly dopey lyrics", he praised the reassuring nature of the music, writing, "It's music that creates a soothing bubble, not to seal off the outside world but to create space to breathe within it." Joe Levy of Rolling Stone praised the group for making music that is simultaneously philosophical and hedonistic. He called the sound of the record: "calibrated normality giving way to all sorts of experiments and revelations. It's clunky and smooth, a clip clop symphony of simplicity done up with complicated touches — both sonic and emotional — underneath." NMEs Elizabeth Aubrey called the album "their boldest offering in years" and "a celebration of life in full technicolour". She praised the group for making dance music as an act of defiance, writing, "Amidst all the experimentation and extremes of this impressive album is a message about life: bathing in the moments of ecstasy will ultimately enable us to cherish and value life more." Anna Alger of Exclaim! also praised the album for its comforting nature, saying that it "provides hope within strife, encourages repeated listens as much for their danceability as the quality of the writing." Stephen Worthy of Mojo commended Hot Chip for their choice of producers and said the band "remain ruthlessly consistent and relentlessly reliable". He called the title track "fail-safe festival material" and "Hungry Child" the group's "purest club moment yet". Uncuts Piers Martin said the band "have seldom sounded as youthful and carefree as they do" on A Bath Full of Ecstasy while complimenting Zdar and McDonald for enhancing their sound. ===Accolades=== Publication Accolade Rank GQ (Russia) The 20 Best Albums of 2019 musicOMH Top 50 Albums of 2019 Slant Magazine The 25 Best Albums of 2019 The Independent The 50 best albums of 2019 Popmatters The 70 Best Albums of 2019 The Guardian The 50 best albums of 2019 Mojo The 75 Best Albums of 2019 Q The 50 best albums of 2019 Under the Radar Top 100 Albums of 2019 Stereogum Best 2019 Albums So Far (Mid-Year) ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart performance for A Bath Full of Ecstasy Chart (2019) Peak position Australian Albums (ARIA) 59 US Top Current Album Sales (Billboard) 40 ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Hot Chip albums Category:Domino Recording Company albums Category:Albums produced by Rodaidh McDonald Category:Albums recorded at RAK Studios

After borrowing four million yen from an acquaintance, who also let him use his shop, he opened "Nowhere", his first store, along with Jun Takahashi of Undercover, on April 1, 1993, in Ura-Harajuku. Deciding to start his own brand, he named it after the 1968 film Planet of the Apes. According to Nigo, the name "BAPE" is a reference to "A Bathing Ape in Lukewarm Water". Japanese people typically have daily baths in water at temperatures above . As such, to bathe in lukewarm water is to complacently overindulge as it implies you have stayed in the bath for so long the water has become cold. This is an ironic reference to the lazy opulence of the younger generation of Japanese, the brand's own customers. To expose the brand he gave T-shirts to the musician Cornelius who wore them when performing. For two years he produced 30 to 50 shirts a week, selling half and giving half to friends.

7465414	A Bathroom of Her Own	"A Bathroom of Her Own" is a short story by Robert A. Heinlein about a political campaign in the U.S. after World War II. Written in 1946, it was unpublished until printed in Heinlein's Expanded Universe (1980).The Heinlein Prize at heinleinprize.com The story has no science fiction or fantasy elements. Heinlein wrote in a foreword: "Any old pol will recognize the politics in this story as the Real McCoy. Should be. Autobiographical in many details. Which details? Show me a warrant and I'll take the Fifth". Another political story of Heinlein's is "Our Fair City" (1949). Heinlein had a cynical view of politics from his experiences on the Upton Sinclair 1934 campaign for Governor of California and his own at the receiving end of supposed dirty tricks during Heinlein's failed 1938 election campaign for the California State Assembly. ==References== Category:Short stories by Robert A.

16538518	A Battery (The Chestnut Troop) Royal Horse Artillery	A Battery (The Chestnut Troop) Royal Horse Artillery is the senior Battery in the British Army's Royal Artillery and is part of 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. The Chestnut Troop is currently based in Purvis Lines at Larkhill Barracks. The unit is currently equipped as a Close Support Artillery Battery, with the AS-90 Self-propelled gun. ==History== ===Formation and early years=== A Troop, Royal Horse Artillery was raised as The Chestnut Troop at Woolwich on 1 February 1793. In 1798 the troop saw action in the Irish Rebellion and in 1799 it fought in the Netherlands. In 1806, Hew Dalrymple Ross assumed command of the unit which he led during campaigns in Spain, Portugal, France and at Waterloo. Ross was later knighted and promoted to field marshal. After 1809, it fought in the Peninsula War. Between 1855 and 1856 it fought in the Crimean War. ===World War I=== The outbreak of the First World War saw the unit, now enlarged to a battery, deployed to France in 1914. It served during all four years, firing its last round at Orrs on 4 November 1918. ===Between the two World Wars=== In 1919 the battery was deployed in North West Persia as part of the Norperforce. and, in 1921, it was deployed to Basra. In 1938, the battery became part of 1st Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. ===World War II=== The battery was deployed to France, serving with the British Expeditionery Force until the evacuation from Dunkirk. Later in 1940, the battery was sent to Egypt as part of the Desert Rats. In 1941, it fought as part of the Siege of Tobruk. The battery served continuously in the Western Desert especially in El Alamein in 1942. After El Alamein, elements of the battery were seconded to the newly formed "Long Range Desert Group" because of their intimate knowledge of the desert and survival skills. Afterwards, it was then re-equipped with 105mm SP guns before fighting in Italy for the rest of the World War. ===Post war=== In the post-war period the battery served in Egypt, the United Kingdom and Germany. Most significantly, between 1965 and 1967 it was deployed to Aden.

55779313	A Battery Shelled	A Battery Shelled is a 1919 painting by the English artist Wyndham Lewis. It depicts a scene from the Western Front of World War I. It was commissioned for the proposed Hall of Remembrance. ==Description== A number of men are seen working and moving around in a grey, cratered landscape with improvised buildings and shattered trees. Brown, stylised smoke pillars are coming out of the ground. To the left, in front of a pile of ammunition boxes, are three men with calm and serious postures, each looking in a different direction. The men in the foreground largely have normal human traits, while the soldiers who populate the rest of the scene lack individual features. The Imperial War Museum's object description defines their unnatural, mostly light brown bodies as "marionette-like". A small officer can be seen in the background, directing a party carrying a wounded man. ==Creation== The painting was commissioned by the British War Memorials Committee. The committee had been created in 1918 with the aim to create a Hall of Remembrance with British war paintings celebrating heroism and self-sacrifice. The inspiration came from the Renaissance, and the dimensions of the commissioned paintings were based on Paolo Uccello's The Battle of San Romano at the National Gallery. The commissions included some of the most prominent British modernist painters at the time. The Hall of Remembrance was never realised and the paintings were transferred to the Imperial War Museum. Lewis served in the Royal Artillery at the Battle of Passchendaele and could draw from this experience when making the painting. ==See also== * Gassed (painting) * The Menin Road (painting) ==References== Category:1919 paintings Category:Paintings in the Imperial War Museum Category:War paintings Category:World War I in popular culture Category:Paintings by Wyndham Lewis
41411552	A Battery, Honourable Artillery Company	A (1st City of London) Battery, Honourable Artillery Company is a L118 light gun battery that provides a reserve to 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery.https://www.facebook.com/pg/ArmyInLondon/photos/?tab=album&album;_id=1200776859985791&__tn__=-UC-R Its predecessor was a horse artillery battery that was formed from Light Cavalry Squadron, HAC, in 1891. It transferred to the Territorial Force in 1908 as artillery support for the London Mounted Brigade. During the First World War it was posted to Egypt in 1915, served as part of the Western Frontier Force in the Senussi Campaign in 1916 and in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign with the Imperial (later Australian) Mounted Division in 1917 and 1918. The second line battery2/A Battery, HACwas formed in 1914 and served on the Western Front in 1917 and 1918 as part of an Army Field Artillery Brigade; the third lineA (Reserve) Battery, HACwas formed in 1915 to provide trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line batteries. Post-war, the battery, along with B Battery, Honourable Artillery Company, was amalgamated with the City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) to form the 11th (Honourable Artillery Company and City of London Yeomanry) Brigade, RHA. ==History== ===Formation=== The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) first raised horse artillery in 1860 when Jay's Troop, HAC was formed. This had a brief existence, being disbanded in 1869. In 1891, the Light Cavalry Squadron, HAC was converted to the Horse Battery, HAC, which in 1899 was redesignated as A Battery (1st City of London Horse Artillery), HAC. At the same time the Field Battery, HAC was converted to horse artillery as B Battery (2nd City of London Horse Artillery), HAC. The Field Battery originated in 1781, but was the second to form a horse artillery battery hence the junior designation. The batteries sponsored the field battery of the City Imperial Volunteers for service in the Second Boer War in 1900–02. ===Territorial Force=== The Territorial Force (TF) was formed on 1 April 1908 following the enactment of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which combined and re-organised the old Volunteer Force, the Honourable Artillery Company and the Yeomanry. On formation, the TF contained 14 infantry divisions and 14 mounted yeomanry brigades. Each yeomanry brigade included a horse artillery battery and an ammunition column. 12 of these were provided by Royal Horse Artillery batteries of the Territorial Force, the other two by the Honourable Artillery Company. On 1 April 1908, the battery transferred to the Territorial Force without a change in title. The unit consisted of the battery and London Mounted Brigade Ammunition Column at Armoury House, Finsbury. The battery was equipped with four Ehrhardt 15-pounder guns and allocated as artillery support to the London Mounted Brigade. ===First World War=== In accordance with the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907 (7 Edw.7, c.9) which brought the Territorial Force into being, the TF was intended to be a home defence force for service during wartime and members could not be compelled to serve outside the country. However, on the outbreak of war on 4 August 1914, many members volunteered for Imperial Service. Therefore, TF units were split into 1st Line (liable for overseas service) and 2nd Line (home service for those unable or unwilling to serve overseas) units. 2nd Line units performed the home defence role, although in fact most of these were also posted abroad in due course. Later, a 3rd Line was formed to act as a reserve, providing trained replacements for the 1st and 2nd Line batteries. ==== 1/A Battery, HAC==== The 1st Line battery was embodied with the London Mounted Brigade on 4 August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War and concentrated in Berkshire. A decision was made to form a new mounted division from the mounted brigades in and around the Churn area of Berkshire. On 2 September 1914, 2nd Mounted Division, with Headquarters at Goring, came into being and London Mounted Brigade was assigned to the new division. I Brigade and II Brigade, RHA (T.F.) were formed for the division and the battery was assigned to II Brigade, RHA at Churn, along with B Battery, HAC and Berkshire and Nottinghamshire Batteries RHA. In November 1914, the division moved to Norfolk on coastal defence duties. Artillery headquarters was established at Cromer, before joining the divisional headquarters at Hanworth in December, and A Battery, HAC was at Mundesley (London Mounted Brigade was at Hanworth). ;Overseas service In March 1915, the 2nd Mounted Division was put on warning for overseas service. In early April, the division starting leaving Avonmouth and the last elements landed at Alexandria before the end of the month. By the middle of May, the horse artillery batteries were near Ismaïlia on Suez Canal Defences. The 2nd Mounted Division was dismounted in August 1915 and served at Gallipoli. The artillery batteries and ammunition columns (along with the signal troops, mobile veterinary sections, Mounted Brigade Transport and Supply Columns and two of the Field Ambulances) were left behind in Egypt. The division returned from Gallipoli in December 1915 and was reformed and remounted. The battery rejoined the division on 13 December, but on 20 December it entrained at Alexandria for the Western Desert, concentrating at Mersa Matruh on 7 January 1916. Thereafter, it served as part of the Western Frontier Force in the Senussi Campaign, taking part in the Affair at Halazin (23 January 1916). The battery returned to Alexandria on 6 March and was rearmed with four 18 pounders. It returned to the Suez Canal Defences on 6 April and rejoined the 8th Mounted Brigade (the redesignated London Mounted Brigade). The brigade left for Salonika in November without the battery which joined the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade when it was reformed in February 1917. It remained attached to the 4th ALH Brigade for the rest of the war. ;Imperial Mounted Division The Imperial Mounted Division was formed in Egypt in January 1917; 4th Light Horse Brigade was one of the four cavalry brigades selected to form the division. A Battery, HAC joined the division on formation and was assigned to XIX Brigade, Royal Horse Artillery (T.F.). In practice, the battery remained attached to 4th ALH Brigade. The battery, and its brigade, served with the Imperial Mounted Division in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign as part of the Desert Column. With the division, it took part in the advance across the Sinai, including the First (2627 March 1917) and Second Battles of Gaza (1719 April 1917). ;Australian Mounted Division In June 1917, the Desert Column was reorganised from two mounted divisions of four brigades each (ANZAC and Imperial Mounted Divisions) to three mounted divisions of three brigades each (ANZAC, AustralianImperial Mounted Division renamedand the new Yeomanry Mounted Division). On 20 June 1917, the Imperial Mounted Division was redesignated as Australian Mounted Division as the majority of its troops were now Australian. On 12 August 1917, the Desert Column disappeared and the Desert Mounted Corps was formed. The battery served with the Australian Mounted Division throughout the rest of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. As part of the Desert Mounted Corps, the division took part in the Third Battle of Gaza (by now re-equipped with four 13 pounders), in particular the Capture of Beersheba (31 October) and the Battle of Mughar Ridge (13 and 14 November), and the defence of Jerusalem against the Turkish counter-attacks (27 November3 December). Still part of the Desert Mounted Corps, the division took part in the Second Trans-Jordan Raid (30 April4 May 1918). XIX Brigade, RHA supported the 4th Light Horse Brigade in the advance on the Jisr ed Damiye–Es Salt track on 30 April. The next day, a strong Turkish force attacked from the direction of Jisr ed Damiye and soon the artillery was in danger. B Battery, HAC was in the rear and managed to get away with all but one of their guns (stuck in a wadi) but the Nottinghamshire RHA and A Battery, HAC were less fortunate. Machine gun fire cut down the horse teams before the guns could be gotten away. XIX Brigade lost 9 guns in total, the only guns to be lost in action in the entire campaign. Its final action was the capture of Damascus (1 October). After the Armistice of Mudros, the division was withdrawn to Egypt and started to demobilise. The last of the Australians returned home in April and May 1919. A Battery, HAC were reduced to cadre in Egypt on 25 October 1919. ==== 2/A Battery, HAC==== A Battery formed a 2nd line in September 1914, initially designated as the A (Reserve) Battery, HAC. It was redesignated as 2/A Battery, HAC on 26 September. The battery joined the 2nd line 2/1st London Mounted Brigade when it was formed in March 1915. On 6 March 1915, the 2/2nd Mounted Division was formed to replace 2nd Mounted Division which had been warned for overseas service. The brigade joined the division on East Coast Defences by June 1915 and concentrated at Aylsham with the battery at Reepham. The batteries of the division were quite unready for war. Three had no horses, the fourth had just 23; three batteries had over 200 men on average, but the other just 91; one battery had no ammunition and another reported that its 15-pounders were "practically useless". In November 1915, the battery received four Ordnance BLC 15-pounders. It remained with the division when it was redesignated as 3rd Mounted Division in March 1916 and as 1st Mounted Division in July 1916. In early 1917, the battery was armed with four 18 pounders. ;Army Field Brigade CXXVI Brigade, RFA was reformed at Heytesbury, Wiltshire in May 1917 with 2/A Battery and 2/B Battery HAC, both with six 18 pounders. The brigade (with the battery) landed at Boulogne on 22 June 1917 and it became an Army Field Brigade. 2/1st Warwickshire RHA, by now also rearmed with 18 pounders, proceeded to France on 21 June 1917 and joined the brigade there. The battery served on the Western Front for the rest of the war. At the Armistice, the battery (six 18 pounders) was still with CXXVI Brigade, RFA serving as Army Troops with the First Army. The battery entered Germany on 17 January 1919, and was disbanded later the same year. ==== A (Reserve) Battery, HAC==== A (Reserve) Battery, HAC was formed in 1915 to replace the original reserve battery which had been redesignated as 2/A Battery on 26 September 1914. It never left the United Kingdom and was disbanded later. ===Post war=== On 7 February 1920, the Honourable Artillery Company was authorized to reconstitute four batteries of horse artillery in the Territorial Force. Only two were actually formed (A and B Batteries), and authorization for the other two was rescinded in 1921. The batteries were amalgamated with the City of London Yeomanry (Rough Riders) on 16 February to form the 11th (Honourable Artillery Company and City of London Yeomanry) Brigade, RHA with *Headquarters at Finsbury Barracks *A Battery at Armoury House, Finsbury *B Battery at Armoury House, Finsbury *C Battery at Bunhill Row, formed by reduction of the City of London Yeomanry. ===21st Century=== A (1st City of London) Battery, HAC In 2018 the battery was reformed as A (1st City of London) Battery, Honourable Artillery Company, equipped with the L118 Light Gun in support of 7th Parachute Regiment Royal Horse Artillery. Under the Future Soldier Programme, the Battery's role was further refined to provide guns 7 & 8 to each of 7RHA's three light gun batteries. ==See also== * List of Territorial Force horse artillery batteries 1908 ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * *The Royal Horse Artillery on The Long, Long Trail *The Great War Royal Horse Artillery Category:Honourable Artillery Company Category:Royal Horse Artillery batteries Category:Artillery units and formations of World War I Category:Military units and formations established in 1891 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1920 Category:Military units and formations in London

44464104	A Battle of Nerves	A Battle of Nerves (French: La Tête d'un homme, also known as A Man's Head) is a detective novel by Belgian writer Georges Simenon, featuring his character Inspector Jules Maigret. Published in 1931, it is one of the earliest of Simenon's "Maigret" novels, and one of eleven he had published that year. It was one of the most successful of the early titles and among the first Maigrets to be filmed. ==Plot summary== Maigret had been investigating the murder of Mme. Henderson, a rich American woman, and her maid, at her house in Saint-Cloud. Despite the evidence against the main suspect, Joseph Heurtin, which earned him the death sentence, Maigret feels sure Heurtin is not the guilty party. Convinced Heurtin knows the real killer, he contrives to let the man escape, following him to see where he leads. Heurtin heads for a small inn on the Seine, the Citanguette, where he lies low. Meanwhile Maigret pursues another lead, a note written from the Hotel Coupole. At the hotel, he finds William Kirby, Mme. Henderson's nephew, and an impoverished medical student, Johann Radek. While Maigret is there, Heurtin arrives, at which Radek contrives to have himself arrested on a minor charge. While in custody, Radek taunts Maigret over his lack of success in the case, hinting that he knows the full story and who the real killer is. Maigret has to endure Radek's needling while pursuing his investigation until he is able to turn the tables on him and unmask the real killer.Simenon, tr.

8100298	A Battle of Wits (2006 film)	A Battle of Wits (also known as Battle of the Warriors) is a 2006 war film based on the Japanese historical novel (Rōmaji title: Bokkō or Bokukō; lit. "Mohist Attack") by Ken'ichi Sakemi, as well as the manga series Bokko by Hideki Mori. Directed by Jacob Cheung, the film starred Andy Lau, Ahn Sung-ki, Wang Zhiwen, Fan Bingbing, Nicky Wu and Choi Siwon. This was a joint- production between mainland China, Hong Kong, Japan and South Korea. == Plot == The film is set in China in 370 BC during the Warring States period. A massive army from the Zhao state is on its way to attack the Yan state. Liang, a city-state on the Zhao–Yan border, is in peril of being conquered by the Zhao army. Ge Li, a Mohist, comes to Liang to help defend the city. Although the King of Liang has already planned for peace talks with the invaders, Ge Li manages to convince him and the people of Liang to put up resistance by warning them of the consequences of surrendering. He also promises the King that the invaders will give up on Liang if they fail to conquer it within a month, because their main target is actually the Yan state. The King has doubts about Ge Li's idea but still puts Ge in command of his army. Ge Li creates a bulwark and various traps to halt the Zhao army's advance. When he insists that Zituan lead the archers, Liang Shi (the Liang prince) is angered because he sees Zituan's archery skill as inferior to his. Even though Zituan later proves to be a better archer, Ge Li's style of working puts him at odds with Liang Shi and the other Liang generals. Ge Li also briefly meets Xiang Yanzhong, the commander-in-chief of the Zhao army, for a board game outside the city to understand each other better. During the first Zhao attack, Ge Li's defence tactics worked well—a Zhao general was killed and the invaders were forced to retreat—but the Liang forces also suffered losses from a skirmish with Zhao infiltrators inside the city. Ge Li's success earns him the support of the people and he becomes a highly revered hero. Yiyue, a female cavalry commander, falls in love with Ge Li. However, Ge Li is reluctant to accept her feelings for him and tries to draw boundaries between them. One night, Ge Li and Yiyue scout the Zhao camp and discover that the enemy is digging tunnels to bypass their city's defences. Ge Li used that to his advantage by luring the Zhao soldiers into an ambush and then sealing the tunnel exits. The Liang general Niu Zizhang massacres the captured Zhao soldiers even though they were promised that their lives would be spared if they laid down their weapons. In the meantime, the King feels threatened when he sees Ge Li's growing popularity, so he plots to have Ge stripped off his post and executed on false charges. At the same time, the Liang forces receive news that the Zhao army has retreated. Ge Li plans to leave Liang since his mission is complete. He goes out to check that the Zhao army is indeed retreating. When he returns, he is stopped outside the gates and is accused of starting a war under false pretences and plotting to seize the throne. Just as the Liang soldiers are about to kill Ge Li, Liang Shi shows up, pretends to fight with Ge, and secretly tells Ge to take him hostage in order to buy time for Ge to escape. Ge Li manages to escape but Liang Shi is killed by a rain of arrows meant for Ge Li. Meanwhile, Ge Li's supporters, including Yiyue, are falsely accused of plotting a rebellion against the King and are arrested and tortured. Yiyue denounces the King and is sentenced to death. The King also has her rendered mute to prevent her from speaking up against him. Zituan refuses to turn against Ge Li, so he cuts off his right arm and leaves the Liang army. One night, just as Yiyue is about to be executed, the Zhao army launches a surprise attack and completely catches the Liang defenders off guard. She is taken back to the prison. Instead of focusing on fighting the invaders, the King orders his soldiers to kill those who try to escape from the city. Liang eventually falls to the Zhao army, and the King and his people are captured. Zituan and his archers manage to escape from Liang, and they join Ge Li outside the city. Xiang Yanzhong sends a message to Ge Li, in which he threatens to kill the people of Liang if Ge does not return to Liang to meet him. Ge Li returns to Liang alone and agrees to play the board game again with Xiang Yanzhong inside a tower. They agree that only the winner can leave the tower. Meanwhile, Zituan and his men flood the areas guarded by Zhao forces and launch an attack. Seeing that reinforcements have arrived, the people of Liang rise up against the Zhao invaders and succeed in defeating them and driving them out of the city. Xiang Yanzhong refuses to leave the tower because he feels that he has lost. After the battle, the King passes by the tower, sees Xiang Yanzhong, and orders Xiang to be killed. While the people of Liang rejoice in their victory, Ge Li rushes to the flooded prison to find Yiyue but arrives too late because she was unable to call out to him for help and has already drowned. Before the film ends, Ge Li leaves with some orphans to promote peace among the various warring states. The King of Liang meets his downfall five years later: The people can no longer stand his cruelty so they overthrow and execute him. Eventually, the Qin state conquers all the other states and unites China under the Qin dynasty. ==Cast== * Andy Lau as Ge Li, the Mohist who leads the defence of Liang. * Fan Bingbing as Yiyue, a Liang cavalry commander. * Wang Zhiwen as the King of Liang * Nicky Wu as Zituan, the chief of Liang's archers. * Choi Siwon as Liang Shi, the Prince of Liang. * Ahn Sung-ki as Xiang Yanzhong, the commander-in-chief of the Zhao army. * Wu Ma as the Royal Tutor of Liang * Yu Chenghui as Dongbo, a Liang general. * Chin Siu-ho as Niu Zizhang, a Liang general. * Xu Xiangdong as Wei Xiang, a Zhao general. ==See also== * Mozi * Mohism * Hong Kong action cinema * List of historical drama films of Asia * Andy Lau filmography ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2006 films Category:2006 martial arts films Category:2006 action films Category:2000s action war films Category:2000s action drama films Category:Hong Kong action films Category:Hong Kong martial arts films Category:Japanese action films Category:Japanese martial arts films Category:South Korean action films Category:South Korean martial arts films Category:Live-action films based on manga Category:Films set in the Warring States period Category:Films set in the Zhou dynasty Category:Films scored by Kenji Kawai Category:Chinese martial arts films Category:Chinese war drama films Category:Chinese historical action films Category:Films directed by Jacob Cheung Category:2006 drama films Category:2000s historical action films Category:2000s Mandarin-language films Category:2000s Hong Kong films Category:2000s Chinese films Category:2000s Japanese films Category:2000s South Korean films Category:CJ Entertainment films Category:Shochiku films Category:Huayi Brothers films

4136530	A Bay of Blood	A Bay of Blood (Italian: Ecologia del delitto, lit. "Ecology of Crime", later retitled Reazione a catena [lit. "Chain Reaction"]) (also known as Carnage, Twitch of the Death Nerve and Blood Bath) is a 1971 Italian giallo slasher film directed by Mario Bava. Bava co-wrote the screenplay with Giuseppe Zaccariello, Filippo Ottoni, and Sergio Canevari, with story credit given to Dardano Sacchetti and Franco Barberi. The film stars Claudine Auger, Luigi Pistilli, Brigitte Skay, Nicoletta Elmi and Laura Betti. Carlo Rambaldi created the gruesome special make-up effects. The story details a string of mysterious murders that occur around the titular bay. Widely considered Bava's most violent film, its emphasis on graphically bloody murder set pieces was hugely influential on the slasher film subgenre that would follow a decade later. In 2005, the magazine Total Film named A Bay of Blood one of the 50 greatest horror films of all time. == Plot == At night in her bayside mansion, wheelchair-using Countess Federica Donati is attacked and strangled to death by her husband, Filippo Donati. Moments later, Filippo himself is stabbed to death by an assailant, and his corpse is then dragged to the bay. Upon investigation, the police find what they believe to be a suicide note written by the Countess, but Filippo's murder goes undiscovered. Real estate agent Frank Ventura and his lover Laura plot to take possession of the bay. After the Countess refused to sell her home and property to them, the couple hatched a scheme with Filippo to murder his wife. To finalize their plan, Ventura needs Filippo's signature on a set of legal documents. They have no idea, however, that Filippo himself has been killed. Their curiosity piqued by news of the murder, four local teenagers Duke, Bobby, Denise, and Brunhilde break into the seemingly deserted mansion and are murdered. Brunhilde skinny dips at the lake, then is chased and has her throat slit with a billhook. Bobby has his face split open with the same billhook. Duke and Denise are both impaled with a spear while having sex. The Countess's illegitimate son Simon, who lives on the grounds in a separate shack, is the killer. After killing Filippo, he is now conspiring with Ventura, who offers Simon a huge cash pay- off to sign the relevant legal documents. Their scheme is dealt a potentially ruinous blow when Filippo's estranged daughter Renata appears, determined to ensure that her father's estate comes into her possession. A search for a will proves unsuccessful, and Ventura, who believes that Renata may be the rightful beneficiary, urges Simon to kill his stepsister. Accompanied by her husband Albert and leaving their young son and daughter in a caravan nearby, Renata visits the house of Paolo Fossati, an entomologist living on the grounds of the Donati estate. Fossati's wife, Anna, tells them that Filippo was responsible for the Countess's death and says that Simon will probably end up with the property. Renata, unaware that she had a stepbrother, makes plans with her husband to murder Simon. After discovering Filippo's mangled and rotting corpse on Simon's boat, Renata and Albert head to Ventura's house. Upon their arrival, Ventura attacks Renata, but Renata gains the upper hand and stabs Ventura with a large pair of scissors in his femoral artery. Paolo Fossati, who witnesses the assault, attempts to telephone the police but is confronted by Albert, who strangles him to death with the phone's cord. Renata decapitates Anna with an ax to ensure there are no additional witnesses. Ventura's partner Laura arrives, planning to meet up with him. When Simon discovers that it was the pair who had plotted with Filippo to kill his mother, he strangles Laura to death. No sooner has he exacted his revenge than Simon himself is murdered by Albert. The wounded Ventura reappears, but Albert kills him after a brief struggle. Knowing there are now no other living heirs, Albert and Renata prepare to return home to await the announcement of their inheritance when they are shot dead from the caravan by their son, who has mistaken their shotgun for a toy. The son and daughter think that their parents are playing dead and rush off outside to play along the bay. == Cast == * Claudine Auger as Renata Donati * Luigi Pistilli as Alberto (Albert in the English version) * Claudio Volonté as Simone (Simon) * Laura Betti as Anna Fossati * Leopoldo Trieste as Paolo Fossati (Paul Fossati) * Isa Miranda as Countessa Federica Donati * Chris Avram as Franco Ventura (Frank Ventura) * Anna Maria Rosati as Laura * Brigitte Skay as Louise (Brunhilde) * Paola Montenero (as Paola Rubens) as Sylvie (Denise) * Guido Boccaccini as Luca (Duke) * Roberto Bonanni as Roberto (Bobby) * Giovanni Nuvoletti as Count Filippo Donati * Renato Cestiè as Son * Nicoletta Elmi as Daughter == Production == The genesis of A Bay of Blood was when producer Dino De Laurentiis heard that Dardano Sacchetti, screenwriter of the popular The Cat o' Nine Tails, had fallen out with the film's director Dario Argento. He contacted Sacchetti and persuaded him to collaborate with director Mario Bava on a giallo film. Sacchetti and Bava got along well, and together came up with a story in which two parents commit murder to secure a better future for their children. In this early version of the story, the parents are driven to commit one murder after another in a chain reaction, becoming so caught up in their plan that they abandon their children for several days. When they return home, the starving and terrified children kill them. The thirteen murders were conceived as isolated sequences, with no initial idea of how they would fit into the story; Sacchetti credits Bava with the idea of two people being killed with a spear while making love and himself with the idea of a woman being killed in her wheelchair. Sacchetti wrote the first draft of the script, titled Cosi imparano a fare i cattivi ("That Will Teach Them to Be Bad") after a line spoken by the children after killing their parents, with his writing partner Franco Barbieri. However, spectacular arguments with Bava and the production team led to Barbieri being fired, and Sacchetti quit as an act of solidarity with his partner. De Laurentiis, disenchanted when The Cat o' Nine Tails failed to recreate its domestic popularity when released abroad, also abandoned the project. Bava, owing a massive amount in back taxes, felt he needed to complete a film soon, and turned to Giuseppe Zaccariello (who had silently backed Bava's earlier films Hatchet for the Honeymoon and Five Dolls for an August Moon) to take over as producer. Zaccariello insisted that the shooting script be written by Filippo Ottoni, who was reluctant to take the job since he did not like exploitation films. Numerous other writers, including Zaccariello himself, had their hands involved in devising the final screenplay.Lucas, Tim. Twitch of the Death Nerve DVD, Image Entertainment, 2000, liner notes. ASIN: B000055ZCA The cast included Laura Betti, who had got along well with Bava on Hatchet for the Honeymoon. At the time De Laurentiis approached Bava about working with Sacchetti, Bava and Betti had been toying with the idea of making a movie called "Odore di carne" ("stench of flesh") about cannibalism on Los Angeles colleges. The film began production in early 1971, still under the shooting title Cosi imparano a fare i cattivi, which was soon changed to Reazione a catena ("chain reaction").Stevens, Brad. Video Watchdog Magazine, #32 (1996), pgs. 10-11, "A Bay of Blood" videotape review Yet another title used during shooting was La baia d'argento ("the bay of silver"), discarded for fear that the movie would be perceived as a parody of Dario Argento's works as a result. The final title of Ecologia del delitto was suggested by Zaccariello because the word "ecologia" was in vogue at the time. The film's budget was extremely low, and it had to be shot very quickly and cheaply. Due to the severe budgetary restrictions, Bava not only acted as his own cinematographer, but also utilized a simple child's wagon for the film's many tracking shots. The location shooting was mostly completed at Zaccariello's Sabaudia beach house and its outlying property. Bava had to resort to various camera tricks to convince the audience that an entire forest existed when in fact, only a few scattered trees were at the location. Betti recalled: "All of this had to occur in a forest. But where was it? Bava said, 'Don't worry. I will do the forest'. And he found a florist who was selling these little stupid branches with little bits of foliage on them, and he began to make them dance in front of the camera! We had to act the scenes strictly in front of those branches—if we moved even an inch either way, the 'woods' would disappear!" To ensure the utmost realism in depicting the thirteen different murders, Carlo Rambaldi was hired to provide the special make-up effects. To create the deaths of Anna, Brunhilda, and Denise, wax effigies of the actresses' throats and backs were constructed and rigged to expulse brightly colored blood when cut. The illusion of Bobby being stabbed in the face with a billhook was achieved with a prop blade which was swiftly pulled out of frame to hide the fact that it was sculpted to conform exactly to actor Roberto Bonanni's profile. == Release == A Bay of Blood was promoted with multiple different titles in Italy. The film was announced as Antefatto ("Before the Fact"), but when finally released to theatres, the title had changed to Ecologia del delitto ("Ecology of Crime"). When the film did poorly on its initial release, it was pulled from Italian theaters and retitled Reazione a Catena ("Chain Reaction"), and was later re-released as Bahia de Sangre ("Bay of Blood" in Spanish). A Bay of Blood was acquired up for US distribution in 1972 by Steve Minasian's Hallmark Releasing, which specialized in exploitation films. Premiering the film under its original English title, Carnage, Hallmark copied their successful advertising campaign for Mark of the Devil by proclaiming that Bava's film was "The Second Film Rated 'V' for Violence!" (Devil having been the first). This campaign prompted a lawsuit from the Motion Picture Association of America on the grounds that it intruded on their exclusive right to rate motion pictures, and the film was withdrawn and re-released under the now common title Twitch of the Death Nerve with a R rating appearing in advertisements. Thanks to Hallmark's distribution partnership with Bava's former employer American International Pictures, the film played for years under this title in drive-ins and grindhouses throughout the country as part of a double or triple bill with other Hallmark/AIP films, most notably Wes Craven's equally-influential The Last House on the Left and Fernando Di Leo's Slaughter Hotel, but it has since been re-released theatrically and on home video under a variety of titles. In the US alone, its later titles include A Bay of Blood, Last House on the Left Part II, Last House Part II and New House on the Left. ===Critical response=== A Bay of Blood was greeted with extreme controversy and disappointment by several critics, especially by those who were fans of the director's earlier, more restrained films. At the 1971 Avoriaz Film Festival, where the movie had its world premiere, Christopher Lee attended a screening of the film, having expressed an interest in seeing the latest effort from the director of The Whip and the Body, which Lee had starred in eight years before. Lee was reportedly completely revolted by the film. The festival jurors awarded the film the Best Make-Up and Special Effects Award. Rambaldi's effects work also earned the film a "Special Mention" Award at the prestigious Sitges Film Festival in 1971. Controversy of the film continued in subsequent years and maintained a mixed critical response. Jeffrey Frentzen, reviewing the film for Cinefantastique, called Twitch of the Death Nerve "the director's most complete failure to date. If you were appalled by the gore and slaughter in Blood and Black Lace, this latest film contains twice the murders, each one accomplished with an obnoxious detail... Red herrings are ever-present, and serve as the only interest keeping the plot in motion, but nothing really redeems the dumb storyline". Gary Johnson, on his Images website, said that "Twitch of the Death Nerve is made for people who derive pleasure from seeing other people killed... The resulting movie is guaranteed to make audiences squirm, but the violence is near pornographic. In the same way that pornographic movies reduce human interactions to the workings of genitals, Twitch of the Death Nerve reduces cinematic thrills to little more than knives slicing through flesh". Phil Hardy's The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror, while noting that Bava was able to "achieve some striking images", opined "zooms, no doubt programmed by the imperative to work quickly, spoil some scenes that cried out for Bava's particularly fluid use of camera movement which were so much in evidence in Operazione Paura (1966)". Reprinted as The Overlook Film Encyclopedia: Horror, Overlook Press, 1995, On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, A Bay of Blood holds an 86% approval rating based on 14 critic reviews, with an average rating of 7.10/10. Joe Dante was enthusiastic about the film, writing in The Film Bulletin (later reprinted in Video Watchdog) that it "features enough violence and gore to satisfy the most rabid mayhem fans and benefits from the inimitably stylish direction of horror specialist Mario Bava (Black Sunday). Assembled with a striking visual assurance that never ceases to amuse, this is typical Bava material, simply one ghastly murder after another13 in allsurrounded by what must be one of the most preposterous and confusing plots ever put on film". In Fangoria, Tim Lucas wrote thirteen years after the film's theatrical release that "Twitch unreels like a macabre, ironic joke, a movie built like an inescapable trap for its own anti-hero... Seen today, the violence in this movie remains as potent and explicit as anything glimpsed in contemporary 'splatter' features..." ===Legacy=== Several critics have noted that the film is probably the most influential of Bava's career, as it had a huge and profound impact on the slasher film genre. It has also been credited as his most impactful work in the international cinema. Writing in 2000, Tim Lucas wrote that Bava's film is "the acknowledged smoking gun behind the 'body count' movie phenomenon of the 1980s, which continues to dominate the horror genre two decades later with such films as Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and their respective sequels". According to Gary Johnson, "Twitch of the Death Nerve is one of the most imitated movies of the past 30 years. It helped kick start the slasher genre… [Bava's] influence still resonates today (although somewhat dully) in movies such as I Know What You Did Last Summer, Scream and Urban Legend". It was listed at No. 94 in IndieWires "The 100 Greatest Horror Movies of All-Time", with its entry stating that the film "remains a vital watch for horror fans, and a reminder of how Bava continued to push horror into new and interesting realms, the reverberations of which are still felt today". Several commentators have noted that two sequences in the 1981 film Friday the 13th Part 2 are strikingly similar to two of Bava's murder sequences: one character is slammed in the face with a hawkbill machete, though Bava's film had a billhook instead, and two teenage lovers are interrupted when a spear impales both of them. Along with The Burning, Just Before Dawn (1981) and several other similarly plotted slashers, Friday specifically "followed Bava's inspired cue, having young people stalked by violent death amid beautiful wooded settings". ==Notes== == References == == External links == * * * * Category:1971 films Category:1971 horror films Category:1970s slasher films Category:1970s English-language films Category:Films directed by Mario Bava Category:Films scored by Stelvio Cipriani Category:Films shot in Italy Category:Films set in country houses Category:Giallo films Category:Italian horror films Category:1970s Italian- language films Category:Italian slasher films Category:Italian serial killer films Category:American International Pictures films Category:Italian exploitation films Category:Italian splatter films Category:1971 multilingual films Category:Italian multilingual films Category:1970s Italian films
17373457	A Bayou Legend	A Bayou Legend is an American opera composed by William Grant Still, with a libretto by his wife and frequent collaborator, Verna Arvey. ==Plot== Set in a 20th-century Creole village in the Mississippi Delta, the opera focuses on the deadly revenge that the beautiful Clothilde enacts on Bazile, a handsome young man who does not return her expressions of love. When Clothilde discovers that Bazile has been in communication with Aurore, a spirit who identifies herself as Bazile's lover from a distant era, Clothilde threatens to have Bazile arrested for violating local religious customs. When Bazile continues to refuse to wed Clothilde, she arranges for a mob to have him lynched. In his death throes, however, Bazile's soul is united with Aurore; Clothilde lives out the remainder of her years as a bitter recluse. ==Productions== Still composed A Bayou Legend in 1941, but it was not professionally staged until 1974, when Opera/South in Jackson, Mississippi presented its world premiere, 33 years later. The company revived the opera in 1976, and in 1979 collaborated with the Mississippi Educational Television Authority to create a made-for-television film version. However, post-production problems delayed its broadcast until June 15, 1981. This marked the first time that an opera composed by an African American was broadcast on television. Leonard de Paur served as the Musical Director and Conductor. The opera was performed in 1976 in its West Coast Premier at East Los Angeles City College, featuring a mostly African-American professional cast, including Delcina Stevenson, conducted by Calvin Simmons, directed by Gary Fisher, and designed by Donald McAfee. This production shifted the time of the setting to the 1920s. Daniel Cariaga's review of the opera's premiere for the Los Angeles Times described it as "joyously and disarmingly melodious, dramatically effective and beautifully crafted...an attractive and poignant work." Still's widow and author of the libretto, Verna Arvey, attended the Los Angeles production. She was given a plaque honoring William Grant Still and said that the production had fully embodied the spirit of her husband's work. The New York Times review of the television production praised the opera as "simple but effective," and described the cast as "exceptionally handsome and talented." The production received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Achievement in Lighting Direction. To date, the televised production has not been commercially released on DVD. == Roles == Role Voice Type Cast (1981 Television Broadcast) Aurore Soprano Carmen Balthrop Bazile Tenor Gary Burgess Leonce Baritone Peter Lightfoot Clothilde Soprano Raeschelle Porter Father Lestant Bass Cullen Maiden Minstrel/First Blade Francois Clemmons Second Blade Irwin Reese Third Blade/MC Ben Holt First Woman Louise Clemons Second Woman Glennye Robinson Third Woman Dianne Wells Deacon Benny Reeves Warden Louis Beverly Second Man James Hawkins ==References== ==External links== *New York Times coverage of the television film version of the opera *William Grant Still Music, site with comprehensive information about him and his music *Interview, Transcript, African American Music Collection, University of Michigan *William Grant Still; Composer, Arranger, Conductor & Oboist, AfriClassical.com * (1941) Category:English-language operas Category:Operas by William Grant Still Category:Operas Category:1941 operas Category:1974 operas Category:Operas set in the United States

H. Asquith) and Rupert Brooke. He then wakes up, and sees on that day's newspaper "a man on the cover we all know, defying the fates" who "seems very sure" of himself. * "Katherine of Oregon": the titular character's name is a play on Catherine of Aragon, whose marriage to King Henry VIII of England was annulled in 1533. The chorus' tune is adapted from the work of Beethoven. The Scottish musician Lonnie Donegan is mentioned. When playing this song in concert, Stewart has jokingly suggested that he may write a sequel entitled "Anne of Cleveland" as a play on Anne of Cleves. ==Class of '58== Stewart originally wrote the song "Class of '58" as 13 minutes long. When the record company rejected it, he rewrote it to the truncated 4-minute version on the album. The long version was subsequently released as a single. In the blurb on the single, it is suggested that the album A Beach Full of Shells was originally intended to focus around this song, which describes the life of a musician on the 1950s rock and roll scene. ==Track listing== All songs written by Al Stewart. ==References== * Category:2005 albums Category:Al Stewart albums

London: Borderline Books. ==Reception== Allmusic's retrospective review hailed the album as flawless brilliance, "the best non-compilation showcase of Kaleidoscope's legendary eclecticism and versatility." They noted the many styles represented by each of the songs, and deemed that "Every one of these disparate styles is performed with authority and commitment, and the result still has the power to amaze." The track "Taxim" is based on "Şehnaz Longa", a Turkish piece by Santuri Ethem Efendi. A 1968 music reviewer stated: "“Here is the most versatile band we have ever heard. You want ragtime? Listen to 'Baldheaded End Of A Broom' which brings back early Spoonful fun. Lovely bass, good mandolin and harmonica. How about authentic hillbilly music? 'Louisiana Man' hunts muskrats in the swamps to bagpipe-sounding fiddles, embellished in drums, of course. Or hard blues? They make good use of their instruments. fuzzed up on the tense, electric 'You Don't Love Me'. High register harmonica screams over a heavy swing bottom. Excellent tension contrasts. 'I Found Out' is a medium tempo folkish tune. 'Greenwood Side', is a slow, emotional Scottish ballad of death, again with bagpipe fiddles and death roll drums. 'Life Will Pass You By', is a Byrd-like song with hillbilly twang harmony and mandolin. 'Taxim' is a long oriental-sounding instrumental, featuring excellent musicianship on caz, oud, harp guitar.Platter chatt: albums from the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Jefferson Airplane, Cream and Kaleidoscope.

37188009	A Beam of Sun to Shake the Sky	A Beam of Sun to Shake the Sky is a public art work by American artist Richard Taylor, located in downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The sculpture was created for the Central Milwaukee Public Library as part of the remodeling of the Wells Street entrance. ==Description== A Beam of Sun to Shake the Sky consists of two vertically oriented sculptures set upon massive granite pedestals in front of the library's glass facade. The sculptures appear to be made of bright red ribbon-like strips of painted aluminum that snake skyward. The individual strips each contain cut-out letters in a variety of fonts, languages, and cases. The twin forms are more dense at the bottom, and become lighter toward the top. The highest element on each side is a short, curved strip painted in gold leaf. With their wide bases that taper upward, the forms resemble red candles topped by gold flames. The sculptures are lit from below at night. ==See also== *Red Flower Rising *All in the Air at Once *You Rise Above the World ==References== Category:Outdoor sculptures in Milwaukee Category:2004 sculptures

It concerns one of the real-life inspirations behind A. A. Milne's Winnie The Pooh. ==Plot== At the outbreak of World War 1, troops march through the Manitoban city of Winnipeg. Among them is Lieutenant Harry Colebourn (Fassbender), a veteran with a gift for animals. He soon meets a bear, Winnie, who provides comfort for the soldiers and by order of General Hallholland (David Suchet), becomes the regimental mascot. == Cast == ==Copyright== To avoid legal problems concerning the copyrights of both Disney and the Milne estate, Winnie the Pooh and anything related to the property is never referenced nor discussed throughout the film. ==Critical response== John Ferguson of The Radio Times awarded it two stars and said, "This touching fact-based drama almost manages to carry off its combination of First World War setting and sentimental tale, but is unsure of its target audience." == See also == *Goodbye Christopher Robin - a 2017 biographical drama film about Milne and his son, with Vaughan also acting as a writer and producer. ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * A Bear Named Winnie at the Internet Movie Database * A Bear Named Winnie at Rotten Tomatoes Category:2004 films Category:2004 television films Category:2004 biographical drama films Category:Canadian war drama films Category:English-language Canadian films Category:World War I films based on actual events Category:Films set in 1914 Category:Films about bears Category:Films directed by John Kent Harrison Category:2004 drama films Category:Winnie-the-Pooh films Category:2000s English-language films Category:Canadian World War I films Category:2000s Canadian films
11662268	A Bear for Punishment	A Bear for Punishment is a 1951 animated Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon directed by Chuck Jones. The short was released on October 20, 1951, and stars the Three Bears. ==Plot== In the Three Bear's cave, Henry Bear is woken up from slumber by a ridiculous number of alarm clocks. Junyer Bear claps and happily exclaims, "Oh boy! At last the great day has come, at last! Oh boy, oh boy!" When he can't shut them up, Junyer silences them all by whispering "Shhhhh!" Henry loses his temper, as he often does, shoving a clock in Junyer's face. He is about to lose his temper with Ma Bear when she reminds him today is Father's Day. Henry feels embarrassed and (reluctantly) allows his family to treat him for Father's Day. Unfortunately, the family's celebration of Father's Day repeatedly backfires on Henry: Junyer trips on a roller skate as he is presenting Henry with breakfast in bed, covering him in food; he accidentally fills Henry's tobacco pipe with gunpowder and causes it to explode when he lights it; and he attempts to shave his "Paw" using a broken, shattered straight razor blade, leaving Henry injured to the point where Ma and Junyer briefly thinks he's dead. However, Henry rises up and beats Junyer again, causing him to exclaim, "Paw is all right now, Maw!" Ma and Junyer then put on an elaborate musical presentation for Father's Day, which embarrasses Henry to the extreme. This includes Junyer reciting a cheesy poem for "My Paw," Ma giving an exaggerated song-and-dance act (while keeping a dead-serious and straight face for the entire time), and Henry being grabbed and dressed up as the Statue of Liberty, while Ma and Junyer (dressed as George Washington and Abraham Lincoln respectively) present him as a tribute to Father's Day. The march, "Father", performed by Junior and Ma, is a special vocal written to the tune of "Frat", a long-standing Warner cartoon staple. This is also one of few shorts where Mel Blanc does not provide a voice for any character. ==Voice cast== *Billy Bletcher as Papa Bear *Bea Benaderet as Mama Bear *Stan Freberg as Junyer Bear ==Reception== Animation historian Greg Ford writes that A Bear for Punishment is "a tour de force depicting Maw and Junyer's overzealous salute to Father's Day... As outrageous as Ken Harris' animation of this pageant is, Jones' drawings of Paw, in intercut reaction shots, are even funnier... It is typical of Jones' direction that, even in the midst of one of the most energetic, floridly animated scenes in cartoon history, the primacy of the single drawing should reassert itself." ==References== ==External links== * Category:1951 films Category:1951 comedy films Category:1951 animated films Category:1951 short films Category:1950s Warner Bros. animated short films Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:Warner Bros.

4232023	A Beard of Stars	A Beard of Stars is the fourth studio album by English psychedelic folk band Tyrannosaurus Rex, and their last before changing their name to T. Rex. It was released in March 1970 by record label Regal Zonophone. == Music == A Beard of Stars was the act's first album with Marc Bolan's new musical partner Mickey Finn and featured Bolan on vocals, guitar, organ and bass and Finn on percussion and bass. It was notable for being the first album on which Bolan used an electric guitar, although that instrument had first appeared on the band's 1969 single "King of the Rumbling Spires"/"Do You Remember". According to Mark Deming of AllMusic, A Beard of Stars "was the turning point where Marc Bolan began evolving from an unrepentant hippie into the full-on swaggering rock star he would be within a couple of years, though for those not familiar with his previous work, it still sounds like the work of a man with his mind plugged into the age of lysergic enchantment". Four tracks from this album, including "Great Horse", were salvaged from spring 1969 sessions for a fourth album with original percussionist Steve Peregrin Took in the wake of "King of the Rumbling Spires". These four tracks were overdubbed for release by Finn, Bolan and Visconti. A further four tracks from the Took sessions – rejected for the final album – subsequently surfaced on various compilations, three ("Once Upon the Seas of Abyssinia", "Blessed Wild Apple Girl," "Demon Queen") in Bolan's lifetime, the fourth ("Ill Starred Man") posthumously. == Release == A Beard of Stars was released in March 1970 by Regal Zonophone in the UK and Blue Thumb in the US. It reached No. 21 in the UK Albums Chart. == Reception == In a retrospective review, AllMusic praised the album as a "Grand Transformation. A Beard of Stars holds on to the charm of Tyrannosaurus Rex's early work while letting Bolan's natural charisma and rock moves finally take hold, and it's a unique and very pleasing entry in their catalog". == Track listing == ==Personnel== ;Tyrannosaurus Rex *Marc Bolan - acoustic and electric guitars, lead vocals, chord organ, bass *Mickey Finn - Moroccan clay drums, backing vocals, tabla, finger cymbals, bass ;Technical * Malcolm Toft - engineer * Tony Visconti - piano, producer == Charts == Chart (1970) Peak position Australia (Kent Music Report) 27 UK Albums Chart 21 == References == == External links == * Category:T.

24714158	A Beast With Two Backs	A Beast With Two Backs is a television play by Dennis Potter, first broadcast on BBC1 on 20 November 1968Radio Times looks at 14 years of distinguished contributions to BBCtv Drama, Radio Times, 27 January-2 February 1979. as part of The Wednesday Play strand. The play is a fictional account of an event that happened in the Forest of Dean in the 1890s when four Frenchmen came over the border from Gloucester with dancing bears, who were subsequently killed by miners coming off the late shift in retaliation for an unrelated attack on a young local girl. ==Synopsis== In the 1890s, Joe - a travelling Italian showman - and his dancing bear Gina make their way over the border from Gloucester to the Forest of Dean; hungry and penniless from their poor reception in the last town, Joe hopes to drum up more business. As they make their way to Berry Hill, a group of schoolchildren racially abuse Joe. After Joe threatens to set Gina on them, the children disperse. Watching from the undergrowth are miner Mickey Teague and his mistress Rebecca. Mickey is reluctant to leave his wife to be with Rebecca, but Rebecca is pregnant and threatens to reveal him as her unborn child's father unless he comply with her wishes. As she rushes towards the town, Mickey brains Rebecca with a rock and leaves her to die in the woods. In Berry Hill, the townsfolk enjoy the revelry of a Sunday afternoon at the local tavern. Amongst them is Rufus, the village 'simpleton', who once again is dancing on tables to the amusement and goading of the villagers. The local preacher Ebeneezer, Rufus' guardian, arrives and removes him. Rufus is beaten severely by Ebeneezer, and flees into the woods where he discovers Rebecca. Ebeneezer follows and upon seeing Rebecca's body assumes Rufus has attempted to kill her. As Rebecca is still alive, the preacher fears that she will implicate Rufus and kills her. Later that day, Joe and Gina arrive in Berry Hill and entertain the townsfolk. False rumours are circulating that Gina had mauled one of the schoolchildren the pair had encountered on their arrival over the border. The townsfolk pelt Joe and Gina with stones and force them to flee the village. Back in the forest, Rebecca's body has been discovered and the local constabulary set to work interviewing the residents of the nearby towns. As the shocked villagers gather together back at the tavern, a desperate Mickey convinces the townsfolk that the bear was responsible. The townsfolk gather at the chapel for evening prayers where a guilt-stricken Ebeneezer delivers a sermon on 'the beast within'. As the preacher calls on the congregation to vanquish the beast in their midst, the villagers choose to see this as a reference to Joe and Gina and a group of miners head off in pursuit of their quarry. Ebeneezer hangs himself and Rufus, upon discovering the body, flees towards the forest. Arriving at the clearing where Joe and Gina have settled down for the evening, the miners throw stones and heavy rocks at the bear before advancing on Gina and beating her to death. Moved by Joe's tears, the men offer him recompense; Joe declines and asks to be left alone with his dead friend. As the miners return to the village they pass a frightened Rufus, and pause to consider his terror. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1968 television plays Category:BBC television dramas Category:Television shows written by Dennis Potter

68147671	A Beast the Color of Winter	thumb|right|Book cover A Beast the Color of Winter: The Mountain Goat Observed is a 1983 non-fiction book by American biologist and author Douglas H. Chadwick, published by Sierra Club Books. Chadwick describes his interactions with Rocky mountain goats and pleads for their preservation. The book received generally positive reviews for its accessible writing and interesting descriptions. ==Contents== A Beast the Color of Winter discusses the lives and habits of mountain goats. The book describes their animalistic nature, avoiding prescribing them human traits. Chadwick also describes his own interactions with goats, including being gored by one after being perceived as a rival, following which he studied goat behavior and behaved appropriately, leading to no further conflict with the goat. The book ends by promoting preservation, noting that goat populations have been declining at alarming rates. ==Critical reception== The book was described by Chris Volk for the Missoulian as "a fascinating and passionate, yet informative and scientific, tribute to one of Montana's most stalwart residents and mascots", and strongly recommended. The book also received a positive reception in The Spokesman- Review, with reviewer Rich Landers noting that the prose was "more readable than you'd expect from a scientist", and noting that while the book promotes a position on preservation that may be controversial among hunters, it presents it in a strong way worthy of consideration. The book was praised by John Wilkes, writing for the San Francisco Examiner, for its vivid descriptions and amusing anecdotes about goat behavior. ==References== Category:1983 non- fiction books Category:Zoology books
53311260	A Beat for You	"A Beat for You" is a song by Australian pop group Pseudo Echo. The song was released in April 1984 as the second single from their debut studio album, Autumnal Park (1984). The song peaked at number 12 on the Australian Kent Music Report. A slightly updated version of the song appeared as the leadoff track on the North American release of the group's follow-up album, Love an Adventure. Referring to this version, AllMusic said, "driving hard rock riffs puncture Pierre Gigliotti and James Leigh's wall of synthesizers.

26389272	A Beautiful Blue Death	A Beautiful Blue Death, by Charles Finch, is the first novel in a series of mysteries featuring Victorian gentleman and amateur detective Charles Lenox. ==Plot summary== The novel, set in 1865 London, follows Charles Lenox as he seeks to solve a murder. Lenox is an independently wealthy gentleman who enjoys solving crimes as a hobby, though he generally prefers to pass the cold winter days in his library with a cup of tea, a roaring fire and a good book. He is drawn into a new case when his lifelong friend and neighbor Lady Jane Grey makes a special request for his help. Prudence Smith, Grey's former housemaid, is dead in an apparent suicide. But Lenox immediately suspects foul play: murder by a rare and deadly poison. Smith lived and worked in the patrician house of George Barnard, a place full of suspects. While Smith played with more than a few hearts, the motive behind her death proves elusive. When another body turns up during the season's most fashionable ball, Lenox must untangle the web of loyalties and animosities surrounding Barnard’s mansion. Lenox receives help with the task both from his faithful valet, Graham, and his friend, Dr. Thomas McConnell. Throughout the story, Lenox’s efforts are intermittently enabled or hampered by Scotland Yard Inspector James Exeter, who requires Lenox’s help with the case but wants always to appear in total control. The subplots of the novel focus on Lenox's evolving personal relationship with Grey and McConnell's strained marriage to Lady Victoria "Toto" Phillips, all recurring characters in Finch's books. ==Awards and recognition== A Beautiful Blue Death was nominated for the Agatha Award for best first mystery of 2007. The novel was also named one of Library Journal’s Best Books of 2007, one of only five mystery novels on the list. ==Publication history== A Beautiful Blue Death was first published in hardcover by St. Martin’s Minotaur and released on June 26, 2007. A large print edition was published by Thorndike Press in December of 2007. The trade paperback was released in 2008. The novel has been translated into German and Russian. ==Literary criticism== Finch received favorable reviews in several major newspapers. Kevin Allman of The Washington Post called A Beautiful Blue Death "a fine specimen of the genre" and noted that "particularly good is [Finch's] delineation of Lenox's cozy-but-proper relationship with Lady Jane." Publishers Weekly praised the book, saying that "lovers of quality historical whodunits will hope this is the first in a series." ==References== ==External links== * A Beautiful Blue Death Official Macmillan Page * Review by The Washington Post * Review by Publishers Weekly Category:2007 American novels Category:American mystery novels Category:American historical novels Category:Fiction set in 1865 Category:Novels set in Victorian England Category:Novels set in London Category:Historical mystery novels Category:Novels by Charles Finch Category:Charles Lenox novels
18237033	A Beautiful Child	A Beautiful Child () is the best selling non-fiction book by author Matt Birkbeck published by Berkley/Penguin in 2004 and in paperback in 2005. It tells the story of a young woman known by many names, including Sharon Marshall, who was kidnapped as a toddler and raised by a convicted felon, Franklin Delano Floyd. The book was also published in several foreign countries, including Denmark, Germany and Poland. A Beautiful Child spurred numerous web sites dedicated to finding Sharon's true identity. Through suggestions from those sites along with reader suggestions from around the world, Birkbeck, in partnership with the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, conducted DNA testing on relatives of several girls who went missing in the early 1970s. World-wide interest in the book kept the Sharon Marshall story alive and led to the discovery by Birkbeck of her biological daughter, who had been placed for adoption in 1989. Sharon's DNA was believed to have been degraded, but testing comparisons to her daughter provided a positive match and her DNA was placed into CODIS, the FBI's database. Continued interest in the book lead the NCMEC to reopen its investigation in 2011. The NCMEC then recruited the FBI in Oklahoma City and two agents, using the book and other resources as their guides, interviewed Franklin Floyd in prison in Florida, where he provided Sharon's true identity. In July 2014, DNA testing positively identified Sharon as Suzanne Sevakis, the daughter of a woman Floyd briefly married in the mid-1970s. Floyd kidnapped Suzanne and her siblings when their mother was incarcerated for 30 days. Suzanne's son Michael, after being kidnapped from his elementary school by Floyd in 1994, has never been located, but Floyd admitted during the FBI interviews that he killed him shortly after the kidnapping. == Sequel == Finding Sharon () is the sequel to A Beautiful Child published in 2018 that tells the story of the ten-year effort by the author Matt Birkbeck, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the FBI to learn the true identity of Sharon Marshall and the fate of her son Michael Hughes. ==References== ==External links== *Cold Case Investigation - Solving a Decades-Old Mystery (FBI) Category:American biographies Category:2004 non- fiction books Category:Works about kidnapping
68646919	A Beautiful Crime	A Beautiful Crime is a 2020 crime fiction novel by the American writer and editor Christopher Bollen. It is Bollen's fourth novel and was written in 2018 during a residency in Paris. The novel was first published in the United States by Harper on January 28, 2020. The story, which is set in Venice, centers on boyfriends Nick Brink and Clay Guillory, who sell an inherited collection of forged silver antiques to a wealthy acquaintance from Clay's past. Their deception quickly leads to more serious crimes, as Clay attempts to sell an expensive property that he does not fully own and Nick murders a silver appraiser who threatened to expose their initial scheme. Bollen described A Beautiful Crime as his most personal novel to date, and elements of the plot and character backgrounds are inspired by his own life. The novel explores the overtourism and depopulation of Venice, and the intersection of greed, morality, and social class. A Beautiful Crime was a finalist for the 2020 Los Angeles Times Book Prize in the mystery/thriller category. It received a mixed critical reception; reviewers generally praised Bollen's depictions of Venice and the relationships between the characters but disagreed on the effectiveness of the narrative's pace. The book has drawn comparisons to novels by Patricia Highsmith, particularly The Talented Mr. Ripley (1955). ==Plot== thumb|The Peggy Guggenheim Collection|alt=A large building on the edge of a canal with a boat and tourists in the foreground Nick Brink and his boyfriend Clay Guillory arrive in Venice, leaving behind their lives in New York City. They first met two months earlier at the memorial service of Freddy van der Haar, Clay's previous boyfriend who bequeathed to him a collection of silver antiques and his share of a Venetian nicknamed "". After Nick and Clay learned that the antiques were forgeries, they devised a plan to settle their debts by selling the pieces to Richard West, a wealthy American expatriate who finances cultural conservation projects in Venice. Four years ago, while Clay interned at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection, he also worked as Richard's personal assistant. When he failed to gain a permanent post at the museum, Clay was devastated to learn Richard was responsible for his rejection and has since held a grudge against him. Nick intentionally runs into Richard and poses as an expert silver appraiser while concealing his relationship with Clay. He is invited to a dinner party at Richard's home, which shares a wall with . A few days later, Nick performs a spurious authentication and persuades Richard to purchase the silver for $750,000. Nick and Clay celebrate their successful transaction, but Nick begins to worry how long the money will last and devises a plan to sell to Richard, who has long wanted to merge it with his own residence. Clay is reluctant because the property partly belongs to Freddy's estranged sister Cecilia, but he eventually agrees to the scheme and flies to Paris to arrange forged documents identifying him as the sole owner. Nick visits Richard again, hoping to persuade him to complete the purchase of , but he is horrified to see Dulles Hawkes, a retired silver appraiser whom Richard has invited to view his newly purchased antiques. Dulles immediately detects the forgeries but plays along with the ruse, and he later threatens to divulge the scam unless Nick has sex with him in his hotel that night. Nick is forced to oblige. Afterwards, Dulles continues to blackmail Nick, insisting they will have sex again the next day and demanding half of the profits of the scam. A panicked Nick follows Dulles to the hotel elevator, which is under repair, and impulsively pushes him down the empty elevator shaft. Dulles dies on impact and Nick flees the hotel. Clay agrees to sell to Richard for four million euros. On his way to the final meeting to complete the transaction, Clay is stopped by Richard's assistant Battista, who has discovered Richard has been anonymously financing a planned tourist development in the city. Battista, a vocal protestor against the development, tells Clay the meeting is a trap; Richard has traced Cecilia, discovered the documents are forgeries, and notified the police. Richard, who is still unaware of Nick and Clay's relationship, casually reveals the setup to Nick. Enraged, Nick fights with Richard and strikes him in the head with a doorstop. Clay is suspected in the investigation but Battista provides an alibi and exposes Richard as the anonymous investor. The attack is ultimately attributed to an unknown protestor. Richard, who has been rendered indefinitely mute from the attack, is transferred to a neurological clinic in Leipzig. Nick moves to a nearby island to avoid scrutiny while Clay remains in Venice, and they continue to communicate discreetly. Five months later, Clay travels to the island when they decide it is safe for him to do so, and they joyfully reunite. ==Background and publication history== thumb|upright|Bollen in 2016|alt=Photo of Christopher Bollen A Beautiful Crime is Christopher Bollen's fourth novel following Lightning People (2011), Orient (2015), and The Destroyers (2017). Bollen incorporated aspects of his own life into the plot and characters; for instance, both he and Nick grew up in Ohio and like Clay, he was an intern at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection after graduating from college. The Venetian apartment where Nick stays is modeled on an apartment near Campo Santa Margherita where Bollen lived during his internship. Nick is partly based on the character of Daisy Miller from the eponymous 1879 novella by Henry James. Comparing the characters, Bollen described Daisy as someone who is "lovely but reckless and falls into danger". Bollen chose to feature an interracial relationship between Nick, who is white, and Clay, who is Black, to represent "two all-American guys" and to highlight diversity within the LGBT community. The character Freddy van der Haar, who represents the older generation of gay men living in New York, was inspired by the American photographer David Armstrong and had a more prominent role in the novel's first draft. Bollen has described A Beautiful Crime as his most personal novel to date. He dedicated the book to fellow novelist Edmund White, who he described as "someone who I really admired who blazed the trail for me", citing their shared Cincinnati roots and White's works of gay literature. White had previously dedicated his 2016 novel Our Young Man to Bollen. In an interview with Vogue Italia, Bollen credited Toto Bergamo Rossi, the director of a cultural conservation nonprofit in Venice, with teaching him about Italy's architecture and the Italian language while he was researching for the book. Bollen wrote A Beautiful Crime while living in a 17thcentury Parisian monastery during a 2018 residency; Clay's brief trip to Paris in the novel is the result of Bollen's promise to his sponsoring organization to set one of the book's chapters in that city. A Beautiful Crime was published in the United States by Harper as a 400-page hardcover edition on January 28, 2020. Harper Perennial published the paperback version on January 12, 2021. Tim Paige narrated the 11-hour audiobook, which was released by Harper Audio. AudioFile review of the audiobook praised the emotions conveyed by Paige's narration but characterized his accents for secondary characters as "inconsistent". ==Themes== ===Overtourism=== Venice is a popular destination for tourists. In 2019, the city was estimated to have 25 million visitors annually. Analyses of overtourism in Venice have reported negative impacts such as overcrowding, a decline in permanent residents corresponding to a rise in vacation rentals, and an increase in generated waste. Bollen, who has called for the banning of cruise ships and Airbnb rentals from the city, wrote in an article for The Daily Beast that A Beautiful Crime depicts Venice as a city in crisis that is "caught in the jaws of a mighty shark". The book explores the city's overtourism and depopulation, negatively depicting the rise of Airbnb rentals in the city and including a scene of residents protesting against foreign investments and chanting "" ("I do not go away, I stay!"). John Copenhaver, writing for the Lambda Literary Foundation, said the book's "central crime" is not Nick and Clay's schemes but Venice's "siege by tourism and foreign developers", and that the narrative's underlying mystery is the identity of those who are destroying the city, representing the destruction of Nick and Clay's vision for their future. ===Greed and morality=== During a press interview for The Destroyers, Bollen said he wanted to create gay characters who are "complicated in a different and new way" for his next work. Though Nick is introduced as a charming, naïve Midwesterner, his greed leads to disastrous consequences, including the murder of Dulles. Brian Alessandro of Newsday described Bollen's casting of Nick and Clay as morally ambiguous criminals as "plucking gay characters out of the ghettos of victimhood or sainthood", and that they are ultimately forced to face the consequences of their actions. Even as Nick and Clay commit crimes for money and revenge, they are portrayed in a sympathetic light. Issues of social class recur throughout the novel; Nick and Clay's scheme to sell forgeries to Richard is rooted in a desire for "upward social mobility in this materialistic milieu". In their interactions with Richard, other characters, and each other, Bollen highlights the effects of social inequality on the characters' decisions and senses of identity. In pursuit of financial security, Nick and Clay seek to reinvent themselves in Venice, at the price of their criminal actions. ==Reception== thumb|A Beautiful Crime has drawn comparisons to works by Patricia Highsmith (pictured in 1988).|alt=Photo of Patricia Highsmith Literary critics have compared A Beautiful Crime to Patricia Highsmith's novels—particularly The Talented Mr. Ripley (1955)—citing similar characteristics such as criminal protagonists and moral ambiguity. The book has also been compared to works by Alan Hollinghurst, including his 1988 novel The Swimming-Pool Library. A Beautiful Crime was one of five finalists for the 2020 Los Angeles Times Book Prize in the mystery/thriller category and was listed by O, The Oprah Magazine as one of the top 20 books of 2020. The New York Times described the book as an "elegant crime thriller", and it received starred reviews in Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, and BookPage. Several reviewers praised the sympathetic characterization of Bollen's protagonists and his examination of Clay's Black identity in the context of racism in the LGBT community. In his review, Alessandro described the novel's exploration of Nick and Clay's relationship, especially as it is tested by the obstacles they encounter, as "sincere and deep". A reviewer for Publishers Weekly concurred, writing that while the titular crime is the focus of the plot, "the story gains its strength from its look at gay romance". Patrick Sullivan, writing for Library Journal, also commended the depictions of Clay's relationships with Freddy and Nick. Michael Cart of Booklist described A Beautiful Crime as "deftly paced and plotted", but Randy Rosenthal wrote in the Los Angeles Review of Books it "not only lacks literary artistry, but it also lacks the thrill of a thriller". Rosenthal criticized the pace of the beginning of the novel as too slow, and said the plot, characters, and language are not realistic. He found the plot toward the end more engaging and applauded Bollen's examination of overtourism in Venice. In a review for The Washington Post, Dennis Drabelle questioned Bollen's optimistic portrayal of Nick's and Clay's relationship in "the dishonest and brutal world [they] inhabit" but praised the novel's suspense and its depiction of Venice. Katherine B. Weissman of Bookreporter wrote secondary characters such as Battista and Dulles are more interesting than Nick and Clay but praised the level of suspense and the setting, and described Bollen's characterization of Venice as "both accurate and eloquent". ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:2020 American novels Category:2020s LGBT novels Category:2020 LGBT-related literary works Category:American crime novels Category:American LGBT novels Category:Fraud in fiction Category:HarperCollins books Category:Novels by Christopher Bollen Category:Novels set in Venice Category:Novels with gay themes

56450073	A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood	A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood is a 2019 American biographical drama film on the TV presenter Fred Rogers, directed by Marielle Heller and written by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster, inspired by the 1998 article "Can You Say... Hero?" by Tom Junod, published in Esquire. It stars Tom Hanks, Matthew Rhys, Susan Kelechi Watson, and Chris Cooper. It depicts Lloyd Vogel (Rhys), a troubled journalist for Esquire who is assigned to profile television icon Fred Rogers (Hanks). The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 22, 2019, by Sony Pictures Releasing. It grossed $68 million worldwide. Critics praised Hanks and Rhys's performances, Heller's direction, and its heart-warming messages. It was chosen by Time magazine as one of the ten best films of the year. For his performance, Hanks was nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, as well as the Golden Globes, Critics' Choice, Screen Actors Guild Awards, and BAFTA Awards, among others. ==Plot== In 1998, at the beginning of an episode of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, Mr. Rogers displays a picture board with five doors. Three of the doors are opened to reveal the familiar faces of Lady Aberlin, King Friday, and Mr. McFeely. The fourth door is opened to reveal the face of Mr. Rogers' troubled new friend, Lloyd Vogel, who has a cut near his nose. Mr. Rogers explains that Lloyd has been hurt (and not necessarily on his face), and he is struggling to forgive the one who hurt him. After explaining what forgiveness means, Mr. Rogers leaves to visit Lloyd. Lloyd Vogel is an Esquire journalist known for his cynical writing. He attends his sister Lorraine's wedding with his wife Andrea and their newborn son, Gavin. During the reception, Lloyd is approached by his estranged father, Jerry, who notes his son’s new family. When Jerry mentions Lloyd's deceased mother Lila, whom Jerry cheated on and abandoned twenty years earlier, Lloyd fiercely tells him not to, and when Jerry insists on explaining his marital frustration, punches his father before being punched against the wall by another guest, explaining the cut by his nose. Lloyd's editor, Ellen, assigns him to interview children's television presenter Fred Rogers for a 400-word article about heroes. Lloyd feels that the assignment is beneath him, but is informed that none of the other heroes were willing to talk to him. Still cynical, Lloyd questions whether Mister Rogers is "for real". Lloyd travels to the WQED studio in Pittsburgh to interview him. Rogers is dismissive of his fame and displays concern for Lloyd's nose injury. With coaxing, he relates some of the issues with his father, whose apology and attempt at reconciliation Lloyd has rebuffed. Rogers tells him his ways of dealing with anger, including striking the keys of a piano. Determined to expose Rogers' friendly persona as an act, Lloyd watches several episodes of Rogers' show, but cannot discern anything. Interviewing Rogers again when he visits New York, seemingly dodging Lloyd's questions, he reminisces about raising his two sons. Fred takes out his puppets and asks Lloyd about his childhood rabbit stuffed animal and his father, provoking Lloyd into ending the interview. Lloyd arrives home to find Jerry and his wife Dorothy having brought pizza while talking with Andrea. They have a terse argument over Jerry’s absence during Lila’s cancer progression and his self-development since. As Lloyd relates how his mother suffered hysterically in her last moments with only him and his sister present, Jerry suffers a heart attack and is transported to the hospital. Faced with his resurgent trauma at staying overnight at the hospital for Jerry, Lloyd decides to go to Pittsburgh to see Rogers for counsel under the guise of work against Andrea’s protests. Exhausted on arriving, he envisions himself as Rogers’ guest, being asked about hospitals. Next, he finds himself wearing rabbit ears and shrunken to the size of Daniel Striped Tiger and King Friday XIII, while Rogers and Andrea (as Lady Aberlin) tower over him. Finally, Lloyd also dreams about Lila, who gently recognizes his anger being for her memory, but assures him that she doesn’t need it. Lloyd awakens to find he collapsed on set. Rogers and his wife, Joanne, bring Lloyd to their home to recuperate. The men later go to a restaurant, where Rogers asks Lloyd to spend one minute thinking about the people who "loved him into being", and encourages him to forgive Jerry. Lloyd apologizes to Andrea for leaving her and Gavin at the hospital and visits Jerry and Dorothy at their home. He learns Jerry is dying of cardiac stenosis, and that is why Jerry attempted to reconnect with Lloyd. Lloyd forgives him, promises to be a better father, and writes an article about Rogers' impact on his life. Lorraine, her husband Todd, and Rogers visit Jerry. Rogers asks Jerry to pray for him before he departs. Jerry dies shortly after Rogers' visit and Lloyd's 10,000-word article, "Can You Say... Hero?" is published as Esquires cover story. At his studio, Rogers finishes the episode he was earlier working on, opening the fifth and final door on his picture board, revealing a picture of Lloyd happily reunited with his family. As the production ends, Mr. Rogers plays the piano alone, stops, strikes the keys in frustration, and resumes playing. ==Cast== * Matthew Rhys as Lloyd Vogel: A cynical journalist who is assigned to profile Fred Rogers for the magazine Esquire. Lloyd is based loosely on journalist Tom Junod, whose encounter with Rogers was adapted into the film. Director Marielle Heller described Lloyd as the viewer's "entry point into Fred's teachings" and expressed hope that Lloyd's character development and growth as a new father would compel viewers to reflect upon themselves. * Tom Hanks as Fred Rogers: The creator and host of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. To prepare for his role, Hanks visited the Fred Rogers Center at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, for research in the Fred Rogers Archives and also watched Won't You Be My Neighbor?, a 2018 documentary film. At the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, Hanks recalled watching "hundreds of hours" of footage of Rogers on set and behind the scenes in order to get into character. Heller noted that Rogers "doesn't have the dynamic nature you need for a protagonist for a movie" and considered him "the antagonist [...] who comes into someone's life and flips it upside down through his philosophy and the way he lived his life". * Susan Kelechi Watson as Andrea Vogel: A public attorney, Lloyd's wife, and a fan of Rogers' show. Watson, herself a fan of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, described her character as a "career woman" who faces unique challenges of patience and adaptation as the mother of a newborn. * Chris Cooper as Jerry Vogel: Lloyd's estranged father and a philanderer who cheated on his dying wife Lila and abandoned Lloyd and Lorraine when they were children. In a press interview for the film, Cooper described his character as "multidimensional" and compared filming a scene with Hanks to seeing the "eyes of God". * Maryann Plunkett as Joanne Rogers: Fred's wife. Plunkett met with Joanne Rogers to prepare for the role. * Enrico Colantoni as Bill Isler: The President & CEO of Family Communications. In a radio interview, Colantoni said he became friends with the real Bill Isler while filming and described his character as having been "so important to Fred". * Wendy Makkena as Dorothy Vogel: Jerry's second wife. Makkena described her character as part of Vogel's "dysfunctional, complicated family". * Tammy Blanchard as Lorraine Vogel: Lloyd's sister and Todd's wife. * Noah Harpster as Todd: Lorraine's husband and Lloyd's brother-in-law. * Christine Lahti as Ellen: Lloyd's editor. Additional cast members include Carmen Cusack as Margy, a producer of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood; Jessica Hecht as Lila Vogel, Lloyd's late mother and Jerry's ex-wife; Maddie Corman as Betty Aberlin, an actress starring as Lady Aberlin on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood; Daniel Krell as Mr. McFeely; and Jordan, Naomi, and Zoey Harsh as Gavin Vogel, Lloyd's son. Notable cameos in the film include Rogers' wife Joanne, Mr. McFeely actor David Newell, Family Communications head Bill Isler, and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood producer Margy Whitmer who appear as customers in a restaurant that Rogers and Lloyd meet in. Arsenio Hall and Oprah Winfrey make uncredited appearances in archive footage of talk shows that Lloyd watches in the film, and Fred Rogers appears in archive footage of his show during the ending credits, singing the song "You've Got to Do It". ==Production== On January 29, 2018, it was announced that Sony's TriStar Pictures had bought the worldwide distribution rights to the film You Are My Friend, a biographical film based on a 1998 Esquire magazine article about television personality Fred Rogers, who would be played by Tom Hanks. The script by Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster appeared on the 2013 Black List of best unproduced screenplays. It would be directed by Marielle Heller; its producers would be Big Beach's Marc Turtletaub and Peter Saraf along with Youree Henley. In July 2018, Matthew Rhys signed to play journalist Lloyd Vogel, with production set to start in September 2018. Being Welsh, Rhys had never heard of Fred Rogers before he was offered the role. In August 2018, Chris Cooper was added to play Vogel's father; and in September, Susan Kelechi Watson was added. In October 2018, Enrico Colantoni, Maryann Plunkett, Tammy Blanchard, Wendy Makkena, Sakina Jaffrey, Carmen Cusack, Harpster and Maddie Corman joined the cast. In 2018, Nate Heller was chosen to score the film. Principal photography began on September 10, 2018, in Pittsburgh, with several sets converted into New York City. Filming also took place in the Fred Rogers Studio at WQED (TV) where the late television host recorded Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, and at the Jewish Community Center in Squirrel Hill. The crew consulted with original crew members from Rogers' television series, and brought in the same cameras and monitors used in the original production. The film received tax credits of approximately $9.5 million against a production budget of $45 million for filming in Pittsburgh. Production wrapped on November 9, 2018. On October 12, 2018, sound mixer James Emswiller had a heart attack and fell from a second-story balcony. He was taken to University of Pittsburgh Medical Center-Mercy, where he was pronounced dead. The film's title was announced on December 27, 2018. The trailer was released on July 22, 2019. ==Release== A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 7, 2019. It was originally going to be released on October 18, 2019 by Sony Pictures Releasing, but in May 2018 was pushed back a month to November 22, 2019. It was released in China on September 18, 2020, after the country reopened theaters following COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns. ===Home media=== It was released by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment on Digital HD on February 4, 2020, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray and DVD on February 18. ==Reception== ===Box office=== A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood grossed $61.7 million in the United States and Canada, and $6.7 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $68.4 million, against a production budget of $25 million. In the United States and Canada, it was released alongside Frozen II and 21 Bridges, and was projected to gross around $15 million from 3,231 theaters in its opening weekend.

It fell just 11% in its second weekend, making $11.8 million and finishing fifth, and remained in fifth place the following weekend with $5.2 million. ===Critical response=== On review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website's critical consensus reads, "Much like the beloved TV personality that inspired it, A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood offers a powerfully affecting message about acceptance and understanding." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 50 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, while those at PostTrak gave it an average four out of five stars, with 66% saying they would definitely recommend it. Steve Pond of TheWrap wrote: "A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood finds a gentle state of grace and shows the courage and smarts to stay in that zone, never rushing things or playing for drama... But just as Mr. Rogers used his show to talk about big issues with children in a tone that was softer and more halting than you'd expect given the subject matter, so does Heller stick to understatement in a way that threatens to become dull or sappy but never does." Benjamin Lee of The Guardian wrote: "It's a given that Hanks will nab at least a best supporting actor nomination but it would be all too easy to forget his co-star. The cynic-becomes-a- believer arc is age old but it unfolds here without cliche thanks to an emotionally intelligent script from Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue, but mainly because of a marvelous, prickly turn from Rhys." Armond White of the National Review was more critical: "Heller and screenwriters Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster don't show enough faith in Rogers' remedies—and not enough interest in their religious origins. In short, the movie seems wary of faith (it briefly mentions that Rogers was an ordained minister) and settles for secular sentimentality to account for his sensibility and behavior. This not only weakens the film, but it also hobbles Hanks's characterization." ===Accolades=== Award Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result AARP Movies for Grownups Awards January 19, 2020 Best Movie for Grownups A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Buddy Picture A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Best Intergenerational Movie A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Readers' Choice A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Academy Awards February 9, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Alliance of Women Film Journalists January 10, 2020 Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Woman Director Marielle Heller Austin Film Critics Association January 22, 2020 Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Art Directors Guild Awards February 1, 2020 Excellence in Production Design for a Contemporary Film Jade Healy British Academy Film Awards February 2, 2020 Best Actor in a Supporting Role Tom Hanks Central Ohio Film Critics Association January 2, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Chicago Film Critics Association Awards December 14, 2019 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Chicago Independent Film Critics Circle Awards January 4, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Costume Designers Guild Awards January 28, 2020 Excellence in Contemporary Film Arjun Bhasin Critics' Choice Movie Awards January 12, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Denver Film Critics Society January 6, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Detroit Film Critics Society Awards December 6, 2019 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Florida Film Critics Circle Awards December 23, 2019 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Georgia Film Critics Association January 10, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Golden Globe Awards January 5, 2020 Best Supporting Actor—Motion Picture Tom Hanks Golden Schmoes Awards 2019 Best Supporting Actor of the Year Tom Hanks Grammy Awards March 14, 2021 Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood – Various Artists Greater Western New York Film Critics Association Awards November 10, 2019 Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Hawaii Film Critics Society January 13, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman- Blue and Noah Harpster Hollywood Critics Association January 9, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks IGN Summer Movie Awards 2019 Best Supporting Performer in a Movie Tom Hanks Indiana Film Journalists Association August 16, 2019 Best Picture A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Iowa Film Critics Awards January 12, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Las Vegas Film Critics Society Awards December 13, 2019 Best Picture A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood London Film Critics Circle Awards 2019 January 30, 2020 Supporting Actor of the Year Tom Hanks Movieguide Awards January 24, 2020 Best Movie for Mature Audiences Tom Hanks Most Inspiring Movie Tom Hanks Most Inspiring Performance in Movies A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood North Carolina Film Critics Association January 3, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster North Texas Film Critics Association December 16, 2019 Best Picture A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Online Film & Television Association February 2, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Most Cinematic Moment A Moment of Silence Best Titles Sequence Online Film Critics Society Awards January 6, 2020 Best Adapted Screenplay Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Phoenix Critics Circle December 14, 2019 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks San Francisco Film Critics Circle December 16, 2019 Best Screenplay Adapted Micah Fitzerman-Blue and Noah Harpster Satellite Awards December 19, 2019 Best Supporting Actor—Motion Picture Tom Hanks Screen Actors Guild Awards January 19, 2020 Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role Tom Hanks Seattle Film Critics Awards December 16, 2019 Actor Tom Hanks Society of Camera Operators 2020 Feature Film Sam Ellison Vancouver Film Critics Circle January 6, 2020 Best Supporting Actor Tom Hanks Washington D.C.

32422159	A Beautiful Friendship (novel)	A Beautiful Friendship is a 2011 young adult science fiction novel by American author David Weber. Set in the fictional Honorverse, the book serves as a prequel to the main Honor Harrington series, which takes place hundreds of years later in the fictional timeline. It features Stephanie Harrington, an ancestor of the main character Honor Harrington who has been mentioned a number of times. The book is in fact based on a short story of the same name first published in 1998 as part of the anthology More Than Honor. == Plot summary == In the early 37th century, the Harrington family moves from the planet Meyerdahl to the newly founded Star Kingdom of Manticore. Their eleven- year-old daughter, Stephanie, is unhappy with this change as their new home, the planet Sphinx, seems to have little to offer, especially with seasons lasting much longer than the Earth's. However, she changes her mind when the hunt for an unknown force that keeps stealing celery from the colonists' greenhouses leads her to an encounter with a new sentient species: a treecat, a six-limbed arboreal mammal going (unknown to Stephanie) by the name of Climbs Quickly. The two beings instantly share a physic connection that future generations will come to call "bonding." This empathic/telepathic linking is involuntary and nearly instantaneous; like love at first sight. Climbs Quickly runs away back to his clan in the forest, which are revealed to be sentient beings that communicate through telepathy. Despite their sentience, they are still at the civilized level of hunter-gatherers, with no advanced machinery and only the early beginnings of agriculture. They are wary of revealing themselves to humans, which they realize are much more technologically advanced, but cannot be understood due to their lack of telepathic ability. Stephanie goes hang gliding several days later, unknown to her parents, as her way of scouting out the vast forest where she suspects Climbs Quickly lives. They sense each other and Climbs Quickly realizes that she is tracking him through their bond. He runs away from his clan's home in an attempt to prevent its discovery by humans. Stephanie crash-lands, caught by a storm, and Climbs Quickly realizes their bond compels him to protect her. They are approached by a hunting hexapuma, a six-legged puma native to the planet. Climbs Quickly calls for aid from his clan, which could overpower the hexapuma through sheer numbers, but he realizes that they will arrive too late. He fights the hexapuma and is stunned, and Stephanie rises to defend him despite her injuries. She buys enough time for the clan to arrive, and the clan literally rips the hexapuma to pieces. Her father arrives soon after, having tracked her wristband, and he takes both her and Climbs Quickly to heal and recover at their estate. Two years later the bond between Climbs Quickly, named Lionheart by humans, and Stephanie has increased so they can understand their emotion and general meanings, despite a lack of clear language. Due to the discovery of the sentient animals, many scientists have arrived to study them, and they constantly pester Stephanie for information. Stephanie attends an event hosted by the mayor of her town in an effort to acclimatize her neighbors to her bond, but Trudy and several other immature children consider him a pet and almost anger Stephanie into a fight. Lionheart calms Stephanie, and they depart peacefully. It is revealed that only one other live human, Dr. Scott MacDallan, has bonded with a treecat, whom he addresses as Fisher. Stephanie and MacDallan arrange to meet, and they discuss the intrusion of scientists and public opinion regarding treecats. They agree to only disclose limited information to scientists, in fear that the treecats could be eradicated, much like previous sentient beings found by other humans on other planets. Stephanie is introduced to friends of MacDallan, and she begins creating a group of allies around her who understand and support treecats. Several days later Tennessee Bolgeo, an agent for Ustinov's Exotic Pets, Inc. arrives on the planet, looking to capture treecats in order to sell as exotic pets. He masquerades as a scientist researching treecats and looks into the range of their telepathic ability in order to decide how to best capture them alive. He develops small devices that sedate treecats once luring them in with celery, which treecats find amazingly delicious. He captures three and heads out to pick up a fourth caught in the forest. Meanwhile, in the forest, the trap is found and Climbs Quickly and Stephanie goes to investigate along with several clan members. They examine the trap, and Stephanie calls for help from Scott and his friends. Before they arrive, Bolgeo comes to collect the treecat and is apprehended by the treecats and Stephanie. He and his accomplices are imprisoned as punishment for poaching, and the book closes with Stephanie being accepted as a probationary ranger to guard the treecat population. == Background == The short story "A Beautiful Friendship" was originally published in 1998, after Stephanie Harrington and her treecat Lionheart had already been mentioned in passing in the main series of novels. The novel is split into two parts, the first of which, Unexpected Meetings, encompasses chapters 1 to 12 and is largely identical to the short story, adding only details like a number of dates. The second part, With Friends Like These..., tells an entirely new story taking place several months later.Weber, David: A Beautiful Friendship Baen Books, 2011 ==Reception== David Weber's first venture into young adult fiction was received with mixed reviews. Publishers Weekly considered the story to be one for fans rather than teenage readers. Liz Bourke, writing for Tor.com, felt the story disjointed and a pair of novellas and, compared to other examples of the genre, lacking a compelling adolescent voice. ===Other reviews=== * Review by Carolyn Cushman (2011) in Locus, #606 July 2011 * Review by Don Sakers (2011) in Analog Science Fiction and Fact, October 2011 * Review by Dan'l Danehy-Oakes (2011) in The New York Review of Science Fiction, December 2011 == References == == External links == * A 16-page study guide for teachers: http://www.baen.com/ya_guides/beautifulfriendship_teachersguide.pdf ** An Interview of DW: https://web.archive.org/web/20120412043434/http://baen.com/Interviews/intweber2.asp. ** The Baen web page had a free story which included these three links: *** Sphinx Immigration Packet: https://web.archive.org/web/20111006061349/http://baen.com/immigration- packet.html, *** SFS Biology Database: https://web.archive.org/web/20111006061919/http://baen.com/biology- database.html and *** SFS Advisories: https://web.archive.org/web/20111006061912/http://baen.com/sfs- advisories.html.

2227179	A Beautiful Lie	A Beautiful Lie is the second studio album by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars, released on August 30, 2005 through Virgin Records. It was produced by Josh Abraham. A Beautiful Lie differs notably from the band's self-titled debut album, both musically and lyrically. Whereas the eponymous concept album's lyrics focus on human struggle and astronomical themes, A Beautiful Lies lyrics are "personal and less cerebral". It is the first to feature guitarist Tomo Miličević and the only one to feature bassist Matt Wachter, who left the band in 2007. The album produced four singles, "Attack", "The Kill", "From Yesterday", and "A Beautiful Lie"; of which three of those four singles managed to chart within the top 30 on the US Modern Rock chart, with "The Kill" and "From Yesterday" entering the top three. A Beautiful Lie received positive reviews from music critics, many praising the album for diverging from the sound of the band's previous work. The success of the album had helped the band receive accolades for their singles such as "The Kill" and "From Yesterday". == History == A Beautiful Lie was recorded on four different continents in five different countries over a three-year period to accommodate lead singer Jared Leto's acting career. The album's title track, as well as three other songs, were composed in Cape Town, South Africa, where Leto was later met by his bandmates to work on the tracks. It was during this time that Leto conceived the album's title. Prior to this, the album was tentatively to be released under the title Battle of One. It was leaked onto peer-to-peer file sharing networks almost five months before its scheduled release; the version of the album that leaked was unmastered. Because of this, the band was forced to set back the album's release date. To promote A Beautiful Lie, Thirty Seconds to Mars included the songs "Battle of One" and "Hunter" (originally performed by Björk) as bonus tracks. "Golden passes" were also included with three of the special versions of the album that entitled the buyer free entrance and backstage access to any Thirty Seconds to Mars show for the rest of their formation. The original 2005 release of the album included the hidden track "Praying for a Riot" inside the song "A Modern Myth". Later releases of the album dropped the song. A Beautiful Lie sold 21,000 copies in its first week of release in the US and has gone on to sell more than 1.2 million copies in the US alone.Graff, Gary. "Thirty Seconds to Mars Plans to 'Extend the Interactivity' On Tour". billboard.com. December 17, 2009. == Alternative versions == === Deluxe edition === On November 26, 2006, a special edition of A Beautiful Lie was released and features different artwork, a third bonus track (all versions have at least two); the UK version of the song "The Kill" entitled "The Kill (Rebirth)", and a DVD that features the music video for "The Kill", the making of the video for "The Kill", live performances and MTV2 moments involving the band. Before production of the Deluxe Edition, the band requested that the members of the "Echelon" send in their names so that they could be thanked for their support over the years. As a result, the inside cover(s) of the Deluxe Edition contain a large list of printed fan names. In addition to this, the front cover contains a lenticular image consisting of the Mithra (phoenix) and the Trinity (skulls). === 2007 re-release === A Beautiful Lie was re-released on November 26, 2007, following extensive touring throughout Europe, in an attempt to expose themselves to a larger audience. The re-release is essentially the same as the original release, although includes different artwork. The album was re-released in Ireland again in November 2007, the version contains the UK version of "The Kill" and a second bonus track, and an acoustic version of the song "A Beautiful Lie" recorded live on a radio session. ==Critical reception== A Beautiful Lie received generally positive reviews from music critics. Jon Wiederhorn from Revolver noted that "intensity and passion clearly inform the textural hard rock of A Beautiful Lie," which "boasts echoing riffs, moody bass lines, and strong vocal melodies that evoke a radio-friendly mix of Staind, Nine Inch Nails, U2, and The Cure." Jaan Uhelszki of the San Francisco Chronicle described the album as "full of ferocious electronics, overcaffeinated guitar lines and anxious drumming paired with brainy, brittle but emotionally austere lyrics." Nylon magazine called it "an album that is digestible without losing the rough-around-the-edges appeal that the band's rapidly expanding fan base crave." Alternative Addiction commented that the band recorded "an album with a handful of very impressive tracks," beginning with "Attack", the first song on the record, which "soars sonically with processing mixed and forceful vocals." Christa L. Titus from Billboard felt that the band "proved its potency" with songs like "The Kill", "Was It a Dream?", and "From Yesterday", and praised Leto's vocal ability by writing, "[he] alternates between cathartic shouts and a tantalizing croon that shows his capable vocal range." Kaj Roth from Melodic praised the sonic variety and summarized the record as "an impressive list of anthemic rock songs." Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic echoed this sentiment, writing that A Beautiful Lie "works well as an album due to greater variety". He also found the record "a more controlled effort" than the band's debut album 30 Seconds to Mars (2002). Kerrang! magazine called it a "great album to close your eyes and fall in to, an anthemic eruption of upfront emotion." In a mixed review, Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic wrote that the "band floats out of time, inspired heavily by '90s alt rock but too clean, heavy, and facile to truly be part of that tradition, yet too indebted to the past to sound like part of the 2000s, either." He found the band "capable enough at shifting from tense quiet verses to piledriving, heavy choruses, but they borrow the worst habits from all their favorite groups, and then assemble them in insufferably earnest fashion, playing clichés as if they were revelations." Christian Hoard of Rolling Stone stated, "[d]espite some credible modern-rock tunes, Leto's self-involved myopia guarantees that his band's second disc is long on melodrama." ===Accolades=== At the Billboard Music Awards, "The Kill" and "From Yesterday" were nominated in the category of Modern Rock Single of the Year in 2006 and 2007, respectively. In 2007, A Beautiful Lie was named Best Album by Rock on Request. Thirty Seconds to Mars received the Kerrang! Award for Best Single in two consecutive years for "The Kill" and "From Yesterday" in 2007 and 2008. Metal Edge ranked A Beautiful Lie one of the top 10 albums of 2005. Melodic included it among the best albums of the year. Alternative Addiction ranked it at number six on their list of 20 best albums of the year. In 2009, Kerrang! listed A Beautiful Lie at number four on their list of the 50 best albums of the decade. The album was included in Rock Sounds 101 Modern Classics list at number 78. ==Track listing== ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from A Beautiful Lie album liner notes.

11365876	A Beautiful Lie (song)	"A Beautiful Lie" is a song by American rock band Thirty Seconds to Mars. The song was released as the fourth single from their second album A Beautiful Lie. It was not released in the United Kingdom as a single. ==History== On May 2, 2007, this was officially announced on the 30 Seconds to Mars official website, but not before checking the preference of the "Echelon". The band could not decide between "A Beautiful Lie" and "The Fantasy"; both songs contain a strong message which the band wished to deliver.30STM - News May 2, 2007 . The song impacted radio on July 17, 2007. It did chart at number 37 on the US Modern Rock charts in late 2007. This was due to the song receiving substantial radio airplay. Though initially released during the summer, the release date of the song had been pushed back to early 2008, possibly due to the long delay of the music video. ==Music video== According to EMI Japan, the video for "A Beautiful Lie" was going to be shot in both Alaska and the North Pole. Jared Leto then moved the video to Greenland and Iceland. The video for "A Beautiful Lie" was shot in August 2007 in Greenland. Jared has said that the video will be environmentally safe and for every download of the video, it will go to an environmental charity. Jared Leto has said on an over-the-phone interview with 99X in Atlanta that the video will be like a short film and a documentary.Interview On 28 January it was aired through MySpace and on MTV. The video shows the importance of global warming. The video was directed by Angakok Panipaq (a pseudonym for Leto based on a character from the Inuit children's book Spirits in the Snowhouse: The Inuit Angakok). The video features hidden frames of coal emissions into the environment, dead animals and a cemetery of white crosses.

Metacritic gave the film a score of 13 out of 100, summarizing the reviews of the seven critics it measured as "overwhelming dislike". The New York Times called it a "laughably clichéd dive into sexual masochism", and The Village Voice saw it as a "misery pile up ... about broken souls and crossed paths destined for the trash heap.

3569822	A Beautiful Mind (film)	A Beautiful Mind is a 2001 American biographical drama film directed by Ron Howard. Written by Akiva Goldsman, its screenplay was inspired by Sylvia Nasar's 1998 biography of the mathematician John Nash, a Nobel Laureate in Economics. A Beautiful Mind stars Russell Crowe as Nash, along with Ed Harris, Jennifer Connelly, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Judd Hirsch, Josh Lucas, Anthony Rapp, and Christopher Plummer in supporting roles. The story begins in Nash's days as a brilliant but asocial mathematics graduate student at Princeton University. After Nash accepts secret work in cryptography, his life takes a turn for the nightmarish. A Beautiful Mind was released theatrically in the United States on December 21, 2001. It went on to gross over $313 million worldwide and won four Academy Awards, for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress for Connelly. It was also nominated for Best Actor, Best Film Editing, Best Makeup, and Best Original Score. ==Plot== In 1947, John Nash arrives at Princeton University as a co-recipient, with Martin Hansen, of the Carnegie Scholarship for Mathematics. He meets fellow math and science graduate students Sol, Ainsley, and Bender, as well as his roommate Charles Herman, a literature student. Determined to publish his own original idea, Nash is inspired when he and his classmates discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith advocating "every man for himself", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success in developing a new concept of governing dynamics. Publishing an article on his theory, he earns an appointment at MIT where he chooses Sol and Bender over Hansen to join him. In 1953, Nash is invited to the Pentagon to study encrypted enemy telecommunications, which he deciphers mentally. Bored with his regular duties at MIT, including teaching, he is recruited by the mysterious William Parcher of the United States Department of Defense with a classified assignment: to look for hidden patterns in magazines and newspapers to thwart a Soviet plot. Nash becomes increasingly obsessive in his search for these patterns, delivering his results to a secret mailbox, and comes to believe he is being followed. One of his students, Alicia Larde, asks him to dinner, and they fall in love. On a return visit to Princeton, Nash runs into Charles and his niece, Marcee. With Charles' encouragement, he proposes to Alicia and they marry. Nash fears for his life after surviving a shootout between Parcher and Soviet agents, and learns Alicia is pregnant, but he is forced to continue his assignment. While delivering a guest lecture at Harvard University, Nash tries to flee from people he thinks are Soviet agents, led by a psychiatrist named Dr. Rosen, but is forcibly sedated and committed to a psychiatric facility. Dr. Rosen tells Alicia that Nash has schizophrenia and that Charles, Marcee, and Parcher exist only in his imagination. Alicia backs up the doctor, telling Nash that no "William Parcher" is in the Defense Department and takes out the unopened documents he delivered to the secret mailbox. Nash is given a course of insulin shock therapy and eventually released. Frustrated with the side effects of his antipsychotic medication, he secretly stops taking it and starts seeing Parcher and Charles again. In 1956, Alicia discovers Nash has resumed his "assignment" in a shed near their home. Realizing he has relapsed, Alicia rushes to the house to find Nash had left their infant son in the running bathtub, believing "Charles" was watching the baby. Alicia calls Dr. Rosen, but Nash accidentally knocks her and the baby to the ground, believing he's fighting Parcher. As Alicia flees with the baby, Nash fights with his visions and realizes that all of them have looked the same ever since he first saw them. He stops Alicia's car and tells her he realizes that "Marcee" isn't real because she doesn't age, finally accepting that Parcher and other figures are hallucinations. Against Dr. Rosen's advice, Nash chooses not to restart his medication, believing he can deal with his symptoms himself, and Alicia decides to stay and support him. Nash returns to Princeton, approaching his old rival Hansen, now head of the mathematics department, who allows him to work out of the library and audit classes. Over the next two decades, Nash learns to ignore his hallucinations and, by the late 1970s, is allowed to teach again. In 1994, Nash is awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his revolutionary work on game theory, and is honored by his fellow professors. At the ceremony, he dedicates the prize to his wife. As Nash, Alicia, and their son leave the auditorium in Stockholm, Nash sees Charles, Marcee, and Parcher watching him, but merely glances at them before departing. ==Cast== ==Production== ===Development=== A Beautiful Mind was the second schizophrenia-themed film that Ron Howard had planned to direct. The first, Laws of Madness, would have been based on the true story of schizophrenic Michael Laudor, who overcame difficult odds to successfully graduate from Yale Law School. Howard purchased the rights to Laudor's life story for $1.5 million in 1995 and had Brad Pitt slated to play the lead role. However, after Laudor killed his fiancée in 1998 in the midst of a psychotic episode, plans for the movie were cancelled. After producer Brian Grazer first read an excerpt of Sylvia Nasar's 1998 book A Beautiful Mind in Vanity Fair magazine, he immediately purchased the rights to the film. Grazer later said that many A-list directors were calling with their point of view on the project. He eventually brought the project to Ron Howard, his long time partner."A Beautiful Partnership: Ron Howard and Brian Grazer", from A Beautiful Mind DVD, 2002. Grazer met with a number of screenwriters, mostly consisting of "serious dramatists", but he chose Akiva Goldsman because of his strong passion and desire for the project. Goldsman's creative take on the project was to avoid having viewers understand they are viewing an alternative reality until a specific point in the film. This was done to rob the viewers of their understanding, to mimic how Nash comprehended his experiences. Howard agreed to direct the film based on the first draft. He asked Goldsman to emphasize the love story of Nash and his wife; she was critical to his being able to continue living at home."Development of the Screenplay", from A Beautiful Mind DVD, 2002. Dave Bayer, a professor of mathematics at Barnard College, Columbia University, was consulted on the mathematical equations that appear in the film. For the scene where Nash has to teach a calculus class and gives them a complicated problem to keep them busy, Bayer chose a problem physically unrealistic but mathematically very rich, in keeping with Nash as "someone who really doesn't want to teach the mundane details, who will home in on what's really interesting". Bayer received a cameo role in the film as a professor who lays his pen down for Nash in the pen ceremony near the end of the film. Greg Cannom was chosen to create the makeup effects for A Beautiful Mind, specifically the age progression of the characters. Crowe had previously worked with Cannom on The Insider. Howard had also worked with Cannom on Cocoon. Each character's stages of makeup were broken down by the number of years that would pass between levels. Cannom stressed subtlety between the stages, but worked toward the ultimate stage of "Older Nash". The production team originally decided that the makeup department would age Russell Crowe throughout the film; however, at Crowe's request, the makeup was used to push his look to resemble the facial features of John Nash. Cannom developed a new silicone-type makeup that could simulate skin and be used for overlapping applications; this shortened make-up application time from eight to four hours. Crowe was also fitted with a number of dentures to give him a slight overbite in the film."The Process of Age Progression", from A Beautiful Mind DVD. 2002. Howard and Grazer chose frequent collaborator James Horner to score the film because they knew of his ability to communicate. Howard said, regarding Horner, "it's like having a conversation with a writer or an actor or another director". A running discussion between the director and the composer was the concept of high-level mathematics being less about numbers and solutions, and more akin to a kaleidoscope, in that the ideas evolve and change. After the first screening of the film, Horner told Howard: "I see changes occurring like fast-moving weather systems". He chose it as another theme to connect to Nash's ever-changing character. Horner chose Welsh singer Charlotte Church to sing the soprano vocals after deciding that he needed a balance between a child and adult singing voice. He wanted a "purity, clarity and brightness of an instrument" but also a vibrato to maintain the humanity of the voice."Scoring the Film", from A Beautiful Mind DVD, 2002. The film was shot 90% chronologically. Three separate trips were made to the Princeton University campus. During filming, Howard decided that Nash's delusions should always be introduced first audibly and then visually. This provides a clue for the audience and establishes the delusions from Nash's point of view. The historic John Nash had only auditory delusions. The filmmakers developed a technique to represent Nash's mental epiphanies. Mathematicians described to them such moments as a sense of "the smoke clearing", "flashes of light" and "everything coming together", so the filmmakers used a flash of light appearing over an object or person to signify Nash's creativity at work.A Beautiful Mind DVD commentary featuring Ron Howard, 2002. Two night shots were done at Fairleigh Dickinson University's campus in Florham Park, New Jersey, in the Vanderbilt Mansion ballroom. Portions of the film set at Harvard were filmed at Manhattan College. (Harvard has turned down most requests for on- location filming ever since the filming of Love Story (1970), which caused significant physical damage to trees on campus.) Tom Cruise was considered for the lead role. Howard ultimately cast Russell Crowe. For the role of Alicia Nash, Rachel Weisz was offered the role but turned it down. Charlize Theron and Julia Ormond auditioned for the role. According to Ron Howard, the four finalists for the role of Alicia were Ashley Judd, Claire Forlani, Mary McCormack and Jennifer Connelly, with Connelly winning the role. Before the casting of Connelly, Hilary Swank and Salma Hayek were also candidates for the part. ===Writing=== The narrative of the film differs considerably from the events of Nash's life, as filmmakers made choices for the sense of the story. The film has been criticized for this aspect, but the filmmakers said they never intended a literal representation of his life. One difficulty was the portrayal of his mental illness and trying to find a visual film language for this. As a matter of fact, Nash never had visual hallucinations: Charles Herman (the "roommate"), Marcee Herman and William Parcher (the Defense agent) are a scriptwriter's invention. Sylvia Nasar said that the filmmakers "invented a narrative that, while far from a literal telling, is true to the spirit of Nash's story". Nash spent his years between Princeton and MIT as a consultant for the RAND Corporation in California, but in the film he is portrayed as having worked for the Department of Defense at the Pentagon instead. His handlers, both from faculty and administration, had to introduce him to assistants and strangers. The PBS documentary A Brilliant Madness tried to portray his life more accurately. Few of the characters in the film, besides John and Alicia Nash, correspond directly to actual people.Sylvia Nasar, A Beautiful Mind, Touchstone 1998. The discussion of the Nash equilibrium was criticized as over-simplified. In the film, Nash has schizophrenic hallucinations while he is in graduate school, but in his life he did not have this experience until some years later. No mention is made of Nash's homosexual experiences at RAND, which are noted in the biography, though both Nash and his wife deny this occurred. Nash fathered a son, John David Stier (born June 19, 1953), by Eleanor Agnes Stier (1921–2005), a nurse whom he abandoned when she told him of her pregnancy. The film did not include Alicia's divorce of John in 1963. It was not until after Nash won the Nobel Memorial Prize in 1994 that they renewed their relationship. Beginning in 1970, Alicia allowed him to live with her as a boarder. They remarried in 2001. Nash is shown to join Wheeler Laboratory at MIT, but there is no such lab. Instead, he was appointed as C. L. E. Moore instructor at MIT, and later as a professor. The film furthermore does not touch on the revolutionary work of John Nash in differential geometry and partial differential equations, such as the Nash embedding theorem or his proof of Hilbert's nineteenth problem, work which he did in his time at MIT and for which he was given the Abel Prize in 2015. The so-called pen ceremony tradition at Princeton shown in the film is completely fictitious. The film has Nash saying in 1994: "I take the newer medications", but in fact, he did not take any medication from 1970 onwards, something highlighted in Nasar's biography. Howard later stated that they added the line of dialogue because they worried that the film would be criticized for suggesting that all people with schizophrenia can overcome their illness without medication. In addition, Nash never gave an acceptance speech for his Nobel prize. ==Release and response== A Beautiful Mind received a limited release on December 21, 2001, receiving positive reviews, with Crowe receiving wide acclaim for his performance. It was later released in the United States on January 4, 2002. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes, A Beautiful Mind holds an approval rating of 74% based on 213 reviews and an average score of 7.20/10. The website's critical consensus states: "The well- acted A Beautiful Mind is both a moving love story and a revealing look at mental illness." On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 72 out of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of "A-" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars. Mike Clark of USA Today gave three-and-a-half out of four stars and also praised Crowe's performance, calling it a welcome follow-up to Howard's previous film, 2001's How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Desson Thomson of The Washington Post found the film to be "one of those formulaically rendered Important Subject movies". The portrayal of mathematics in the film was praised by the mathematics community, including John Nash himself. John Sutherland of The Guardian noted the film's biopic distortions, but said: Some writers such as Shailee Koranne argue that the film presents an unrealistic or inappropriate depiction of the disorder schizophrenia, which the protagonist John Nash suffers from, stating that places too much emphasis on “fixing” the disorder.Shailee Koranne, 'How schizophrenia is misrepresented in TV and film' Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Lisa Navarrette criticized the casting of Jennifer Connelly as Alicia Nash as an example of whitewashing. Alicia Nash was born in El Salvador and had an accent not portrayed in the film. ===Box office=== During the five-day weekend of the limited release, A Beautiful Mind opened at the #12 spot at the box office, peaking at the #2 spot following the wide release.

10260791	A Beautiful Mind (soundtrack)	A Beautiful Mind is the original soundtrack album, on the Decca Records label, of the 2001 film A Beautiful Mind starring Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly (who won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her role as "Alicia Nash"), Christopher Plummer and Paul Bettany. The original score and songs were composed and conducted by James Horner. The album garnered nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score. Music critics felt that the musical score fit the film well, but believed it to be similar to several of Horner's previous films. ==Development== Composer James Horner was a frequent collaborator with Ron Howard, the director of A Beautiful Mind. Horner desired to feature vocals reminiscent of being midway between a girl and woman, and wrote the score specifically for 15-year-old Welsh singer Charlotte Church. To convey "the beauty of mathematics", Horner decided to use the idea of a kaleidoscope, as its "patterns are always changing, and things move very quickly, but in moving so quickly, they create other patterns that move very slowly underneath". He added that these changing patterns were conveyed with the piano and Church's voice. ==Release and reception== Writing for Empire magazine, Danny Graydon gave the soundtrack four out of five stars. He thought the score contained elements of Horner's previous films Sneakers (1992) and Bicentennial Man (1999), but said "if you can forgive that, this is a clever, masterful and romantic score that captures a brilliant mind in conflict". In the tracks "Creating Government Dynamics" and "Cracking The Russian Codes", Graydon opined that Church's "poignant vocals mix well with the frenetic piano and strings to represent Nash’s brilliance" and wished that her voice had been used more in the film. Dan Goldwasser of Soundtrack.net also found similarities to the score in Bicentennial Man, but thought Horner's work fit the film regardless, explaining "it effectively underscores the drama and romance, and even provides a few bits of tension for the action scene". Goldwasser concluded that "while it all works well in the film, there is enough about this score that just seemed to 'familiar' to make it stand out". Contributing to National Public Radio, Andy Trudeau believed Church's particular voice adds a "human element. It's the sound that, I think, gives a sense of--the center of this character, if you will. I think it's the soul. And it's trying to be normal in a way, and underneath it it's trying to be crazy". Horner's score garnered nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the Academy Award for Best Original Score. It lost the Golden Globe to the film Moulin Rouge! and the Oscar to The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. ==Track listing== Adapted from: No. Title 1 "A Kaleidoscope of Mathematics" 2 "Playing a Game of 'Go!'" 3 "Looking for the Next Great Idea" 4 "Creating 'Governing Dynamics'" 5 "Cracking the Russian Codes" 6 "Nash Descends into Parcher's World" 7 "First Drop-Off, First Kiss" 8 "The Car Chase" 9 "Alicia Discovers Nash's Dark World" 10 "Real or Imagined?" 11 "Of One Heart, of One Mind" 12 "Saying Goodbye to Those You So Love" 13 "Teaching Mathematics Again" 14 "The Prize of One's Life...

12561724	A Beautiful Morning	"A Beautiful Morning" is a song written by Felix Cavaliere and Eddie Brigati and recorded by the Rascals. Coming out in early 1968, it was the group's first track released after shortening their name from the Young Rascals. The single was one of the earliest released in stereo, as 7-inch singles generally were in mono. Together with the Doors "Hello, I Love You", it's credited with changing the industry standard of singles. The song continued the theme of carefree optimism that had distinguished the previous year's "Groovin'". It was written one morning in Honolulu, Hawaii when the band was invited to perform there by promoter Tom Moffatt. It became a big hit in the United States, reaching number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, and also reaching number 36 on the Hot Rhythm & Blues Singles chart. It was RIAA-certified as a Million Seller on June 28, 1968. The first album on which the song appeared was Time Peace: The Rascals' Greatest Hits. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1968) Peak position Australia KMR 36 Canada RPM Top SinglesImage : RPM Weekly - Library and Archives Canada 1 US Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–2002 3 US Billboard R&B; 36 US Cash Box Top 100 3 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1968) Rank Canada 15 US Billboard Hot 100 35 US Cash Box 17 == Other versions == Renée Geyer covered the song on her album Dedicated (2007). == In other media == The song is featured in a Scrubs episode, at the start of a season 6 episode with Zach Braff, who plays J.D., dancing to it. It was also featured at the end of a second-season episode of The Greatest American Hero, in which Ralph had to disarm a nuclear missile. It was also featured in the movie Kingpin immediately following the scene that shows how Roy got his rubber hand. The song was featured during the 1969 college graduation scene in The First Wives Club. It was also used in the 1993 movie A Bronx Tale opening the racetrack scene, as well as on Arrow at the end of the eighteenth episode of the fifth season, titled "Disbanded". The song was also featured in season 3 episode 14 and season 5 episode 1 of The King of Queens. Sugar Pine 7 used it in the episode of the same name from their webseries Alternative Lifestyle in 2017. The song's opening lines featured prominently in a 2002 TV commercial for the (since-recalled) pain reliever Vioxx, which opens with an idyllic clip of former Olympic champion figure skater Dorothy Hamill, skating on a pond amid bright sunshine. ==References== ==External links== * [ Song Review] from Allmusic * Category:1968 singles Category:The Rascals songs Category:Songs written by Felix Cavaliere Category:Songs written by Eddie Brigati Category:RPM Top Singles number-one singles Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:1967 songs

65747423	A Beautiful Noise	"A Beautiful Noise" is a song recorded by American recording artists Alicia Keys and Brandi Carlile. The song was written by Keys, Carlile, Brandy Clark, Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna, Hailey Whitters, Linda Perry and Ruby Amanfu. It was released as a single on October 29, 2020 through RCA Records. The song was performed live on Every Vote Counts: A Celebration of Democracy, and they released the single immediately following the song's premiere on CBS. The song was also included on the digital reissue of Keys' seventh studio album Alicia (2020), released on December 18, 2020. The song received a nomination for Song of the Year at the 64th Annual Grammy Awards. == Background == "A Beautiful Noise" was recorded to inspire American voters to vote in the 2020 presidential election. The song was created by an all-female songwriting team consisting of Alicia Keys, Brandi Carlile, Brandy Clark, Hillary Lindsey, Lori McKenna, Hailey Whitters, Linda Perry and Ruby Amanfu. Brandy Clark was the first songwriter added to the team, followed by Lori McKenna, Hillary Lindsey and so on. The song was passed around between all eight writers with the goal of representing diversity through a variety of views, voices, and perspectives. In a Variety article, Ali Harnell of Live Nation discussed how the song came to be, stating that they had hoped to celebrate women's suffrage in advance of the 2020 Presidential Election. The year 2020 marks the 100-year anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, and the song aims to honor these causes according to Harnell. The #ABeautifulNoise Challenge was created on social media inspired by the song to encourage voter turnout via social channels. The #ABeautifulNoice Challenge tasks viewers with sharing how and why they plan to make a beautiful noise in the 2020 election and beyond. Keys commented that "Everyone has the power to make beautiful noise and to lift others up with their voice. And now more than ever, we need to let those voices be heard by voting". Carlile stated that the song "is an important reminder that we all have a voice and that our voices count". == Composition and lyrics == The song is a stripped-down, piano-driven R&B;/soul track that lasts for a duration of three minutes and nineteen seconds. It is written in the key of A minor with a time signature and a tempo of 76 beats per minute. Jon Blistein from Rolling Stone described the song as "straightforward but effective bit of piano balladry". Writer for the website PopSugar stated that the "powerful track" offers "a dose of inspiration" in lyrics like "It's believing you belong / It's calling out the wrong". In the song, Keys and Carlile assure that "I have a voice", and writing for the website Live For Live Music, Michael Broerman opined that the song "tell[s] the story of marginalized communities finally gaining their birthright to fully participate in society". Sidney Miller from Country Queer wrote that albeit having "a sense of anger and righteousness", the "calming, melodic" song "masterfully blends both of their piano-playing skills and voices". == Live performance == Alicia Keys hosted CBS' Every Vote Counts: A Celebration of Democracy special alongside Kerry Washington and America Ferrera which is where the song was first premiered. Alicia Keys and Brandi Carlile sat at separate pianos across from each other as they performed a live rendition of the song. Keys and Carlile performed with no additional musical accompaniment besides their pianos. == Charts == Chart performance for "A Beautiful Noise" Chart (2020) Peak position US Digital Song Sales (Billboard) 8 == References == Category:2020 songs Category:2020 singles Category:Alicia Keys songs Category:Brandi Carlile songs Category:RCA Records singles Category:Songs written by Linda Perry Category:Song recordings produced by Alicia Keys
70582310	A Beautiful Noise (musical)	A Beautiful Noise is a jukebox musical based on the life and music of Neil Diamond. It opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre on December 4, 2022. It grossed more than $1 million at the box office in the week leading up to its Broadway premiere. Titled for Diamond's 1976 album of the same name, A Beautiful Noise was written by Anthony McCarten and produced by Ken Davenport and Bob Gaudio. The musical is structured around a series of therapy sessions during which Diamond reacts to his lyrics as they are read by his psychiatrist from a second-hand copy of The Complete Lyrics of Neil Diamond. In a June 19, 2022 interview with The Boston Globe McCarten said: “She opens the book, and all 60 years of his songwriting and all that exploration pours out into a majestic musical collage, and once unloosed from the book, the songs take on lives of their own." Prior to its Broadway debut, A Beautiful Noise ran for four weeks at the Emerson Colonial Theatre in Boston. Diamond and his wife, Katie McNeil Diamond, attended the opening in Boston. They also attended the Broadway premiere, where Diamond led an unannounced sing-along of "Sweet Caroline." In Boston, Will Swenson portrayed Diamond (then); Diamond (now) was played by Mark Jacoby. Robyn Hurder played Diamond's second wife, Marcia, and Linda Powell portrays The Doctor. In September 2022 it was announced that Swenson, Jacoby, Hurder and Powell would reprise their roles in the Broadway production and the full Broadway cast was announced. It included Jessie Fisher as Jaye Posner, Tom Alan Robbins as Bert Berns and Kieve Diamond, Bri Sudia as Ellie Greenwich and Rose Diamond, and Michael McCormick as Fred Colby and Tommy O’Rourke. thumb|On December 4, 2022 (Opening Night on Broadway), Neil Diamond surprised the audience, cast, and crew with a performance of "Sweet Caroline". == Cast and characters == Characters Broadway (2022) Neil Diamond (Then) Will Swenson Neil Diamond (Now) Mark Jacoby Marcia Murphey Robyn Hurder Doctor Linda Powell Jaye Posner Jessie Fisher Fred Colby, Tommy O’Rourke Michael McCormick Bert Berns, Kieve Diamond Tom Alan Robbins Ellie Greenwich, Rose Diamond Bri Sudia ==Reception== In Boston, reviews of A Beautiful Noise were positive, with Swenson earning significant praise. In The Boston Globe he was described as a "shining Diamond"; WBUR reported that the musical included "dynamic performances top to bottom" with the "swagger-filled Will Swenson as Diamond" and a "terrific ensemble more than a dozen talented actors and singers." Reviews of A Beautiful Noise on Broadway were mixed-to-negative. Elizabeth Vincentelli wrote in the New York Times that the musical was both "timid" and an "ambitious, often rousing, occasionally heavy-handed biographical show". She praised Swenson's performance but criticized the narrative framework and the overall depiction of Diamond as "morose." A positive review in the New York Daily News predicted that the show would be a "box-office hit". In Variety, A.D. Amorosi wrote: "Ultimately, 'A Beautiful Noise' is victorious, but not without a few rough bumps along the way — much like the trajectory of Diamond’s life." The headline of an AP review by Mark Kennedy in the Washington Post read "Broadway's Diamond show isn't so good, so good" while noting that Swenson was "insanely great in every number." The review that appeared in Entertainment Weekly noted that "those going to A Beautiful Noise want to be entertained and entertained they will be." == Awards and nominations == 2022 Broadway production Year Award Category Nominee Result 2023 Drama Desk Awards Outstanding Featured Performance in a Musical Robyn Hurder Mark Jacoby Outstanding Wig and Hair Luc Verschueren Drama League Awards Distinguished Performance Award Will Swenson Outstanding Production of a Musical Outer Critics Circle Awards Outstanding New Broadway Musical Chita Rivera Awards Outstanding Choreography in a Broadway Show Steven Hoggett Outstanding Dancer in a Broadway Show Robyn Hurder Jess LeProtto Outstanding Ensemble in a Broadway Show ==References== ==External links== * Category:2022 musicals Category:Broadway musicals Category:Biographical musicals Category:Neil Diamond Category:Jukebox musicals

20980418	A Beautiful Place to Die	A Beautiful Place to Die is the debut novel of award-winning filmmaker Malla Nunn.JAY STRAFFORD, "Globe-trotting with the Grim Reaper ," Richmond-Times Dispatch (25 January 2009). It was a recipient of the 2009 Davitt Award. ==Characters in A Beautiful Place to Die== Det. Emmanuel Cooper is the main character in the book. Chris Nashawaty describes the character as "an English WWII veteran who emigrated to Johannesburg in the early '50s, a toxic time when the country's racial divisions couldn't have been more black-and-white. He's a stranger in a strange land, not only because he doesn't use skin color to determine guilt or innocence but also because he barely understands just how deep these fault lines go."Chris Nashawaty, "Books: Malla Nunn's thriller digs up a murder in '50s South Africa," Entertainment Weekly 1029 (9 January 2009), 65. ==Major themes== Kirkus Reviews explains that race "is a major issue in the narrative; Afrikaners and people of color eye each other warily owing to the recent advent of laws that prescribe how whites and blacks can and can't interact....The author sets his story in Jacob's Rest, a small village with rigid racial distinctions.""Review of A Beautiful Place to Die," Kirkus Reviews 76.20 (10/15/2008): 1089–1090. ==Literary significance and reception== Publishers Weekly compares the book to Charles Todd's Inspector Rutledge series and calls it "a welcome addition to crime fiction set in South Africa.""Review of A Beautiful Place to Die," Publishers Weekly 255.43 (10/27/2008): 32. USA Today declares the book "a great beginning to a series that mixes crime-solving with South African history."Carol Memmott, "International mysteries," USA Today (01/29/2009): Life 05d. Graeme Blundell praises the book as "lovely" and commends Nunn for setting "her characters brilliantly within a complex psychological portrayal of a particular time and place."Graeme Blundell, "Sod goodwill, give me crime ," The Australian (6 December 2008). Jay strafford writes that the book "will long echo in your mind" and that "Nunn brings this entirely plausible work to a close and leaves the reader eager for the next case facing her winning, troubled protagonist." Nashawaty writes that "as a character, Cooper's no Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe. He feels sketchy, half-drawn--not quite alive yet. Next time out, we'll need...more cluses about what makes this new sleuth tick." Nevertheless, Nasawaty still gives the book a B overall. Sarah Weinman writes, "Nunn teases out a complex tale of sexual depravity and family members prepared to protect even the worst of secrets in beautifully layered prose, but what makes A Beautiful Place to Die a debut to savor is the interplay between the cusp of social change and how then-socially accepted values seem monstrous to the modern reader."Sarah Weinman, "Books in Brief," The Baltimore Sun (4 January 2009). ==Publication history== * 2008, Australia, Pan Macmillan, , Pap date 1 September 2008 * 2009, United States of America, Atria , Pub date 6 January 2009 ==Footnotes== Category:2008 Australian novels Category:Apartheid novels Category:Australian mystery novels Category:Novels set in South Africa Category:Fiction set in the 1950s Category:2008 debut novels Category:Macmillan Publishers books

49210464	A Beautiful Planet	A Beautiful Planet is a 2016 American documentary film directed, written, and produced by Toni Myers, and narrated by actress Jennifer Lawrence. It was originally released exclusively for IMAX theatres. Created in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the documentary utilizes footage recorded by astronauts aboard the International Space Station (ISS) over the course of fifteen months. The documentary examines how astronauts live and work on a daily basis. The astronauts are representing the respective space agencies of the United States, Russia, Europe, and Japan. The documentary premiered in Manhattan, in New York City, on April 16, 2016, and made it's theatrical debut on April 29, 2016. The film was first aired domestically in the United States, grossing $15.6 million. It was later aired in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and Russia/CIS. ==Content overview== A Beautiful Planet utilizes large-scale cinema screens to display capital cities illuminated by skyglow, lightning storms seen above clouds, Super Typhoon Maysak as seen from its eye, polar auroras viewed from low Earth orbit, the Great Lakes of North America locked in ice and snow, and reefs below the surface of the Caribbean Sea. == The big picture == The film depicts views of space from the International Space Station (ISS) of geographical formations that may not be visible from the land such as annular lake, Lake Manicouagan in Quebec, Canada. Scenes from the documentary show a snow-capped segment of South America's Andes, the longest continental mountain range in the world. The Andes stretch from Venezuela north of the Equator, through the Tropics, and down to southern Argentina, and contain "some of the most extreme climate zones on earth. All between "ice fields and deserts". The Andean Mountains include Aconcagua, the highest peak in The Americas, as well as the highest in the Southern Hemisphere. The movie presents Earth's driest and wettest areas with an overhead sequence of the Namib Desert on the east cleft by the Atlantic Ocean's Skeleton Coast in the west. The film repeats the consensus that the Namib is the "oldest desert" on Earth, having a desert climate longer than any other region in the world, and being around tens of millions of years longer than the Sahara. The film begins with a light-years- long, computer-generated trip through swarms of stars in the Milky Way; the compressed trip ends with the Solar System. The film uses time-lapse photography to depict how Earth's warming climate is causing the Greenland ice sheet to melt, using footage of the Jakobshavn Glacier calving. A Beautiful Planet also presents images of large-scale deforestation in Madagascar. The film shows how this island suffers from widespread soil erosion and habitat destruction of the island's native wildlife, such as the lemur. A Beautiful Planet also shows images of the burning of the Brazilian rainforest. The film depicts multiple scenes of climate change and environmental degradation. Filmmaker Toni Myers told the Los Angeles Times, "I wanted to inspire people especially as to how beautiful the planet is, how fragile it is, how complex and diverse and varied it is ... Most of all I wanted to show why we want to find solutions to look after our planet. It's our only one." The movie often depicts the astronauts working together. They also are commonly found looking out the window. === Exoplanet Kepler-186f === The final scenes of A Beautiful Planet briefly examine an extrasolar planet (a planet outside of our planetary system), which was discovered in 2014. The planet, Kepler-186f, was the first approximately-Earth-sized planet found to be orbiting within its star's habitable zone. The orbital area where liquid water could conceivably exist without freezing or vaporizing. It was the first discovery of an Earth-sized planet on which life could reside. The name "Kepler" comes from its discovery by the Kepler Space Telescope, or "NASA Discovery Mission Number 10," a spacecraft observatory which is designed to find exoplanets in our region of the Milky Way Galaxy that are Earth-sized and smaller, and that are within the habitable zone. The planet orbits Kepler-186, a red dwarf star about half the size and mass of the Sun which lies in the direction of the constellation Cygnus, about 500 light-years away. The number "186" in the planet's name refers to the order in which its planetary system was discovered while scientists processed all of the data produced by the Kepler Space Telescope. Although the idea of interstellar travel to another planetary system like Kepler-186f is not feasible given current astronautics technology, some spaceflight futurists (like Samantha Cristoforetti) find value in speculating about the currently-impossible. ===The astronauts=== The film's cast reflects the fact that the crew of the International Space Station is rather diverse. The astronauts who appeared in the movie included the following: * Cristoforetti, Samantha: Spent more time in an uninterrupted spaceflight than any other European astronaut. * Kelly, Scott: Spent roughly a year in space during a long, uninterrupted stay aboard the International Space Station. * Lindgren, Kjell: A medical doctor who had previously worked as a flight surgeon supporting medical operations and space-station training at NASA's Johnson Space Center. * Shkaplerov, Anton: Commander of the Soyuz spacecraft that brought Cristoforetti and Virts to the Space Station. * Virts, Terry: Commander of the 43rd expedition to the ISS from March 11, 2015 to June 11, 2015. * Wilmore, Barry "Butch": Commander of the 42nd expedition to the ISS from November 10, 2014 to March 11, 2015. * Yui, Kimiya: Designated as Head of the JAXA Astronaut Group after he returned from his stay on the Space Station. === Research lab === The International Space Station is a scientific laboratory, and many of the experiments on the ISS have the astronauts themselves as research participants to determine how spaceflight affects the human body. On March 28, 2015 Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko arrived at the Space Station to commence a much-discussed one year mission to study the health effects of long-term space travel. Scientists hoped to analyze their mission and discover ways future space explorers might adjust to the effects of weightlessness, isolation, radiation exposure, and stress they would encounter in a 30-month-round-trip expedition to Mars, or in an even longer trip beyond Mars. Shortly after Kelly's arrival at the Space Station, A Beautiful Planet shows him participating in an initial examination of his eye, to study and correct any vision decline reported by many astronauts. Scott Kelly has an identical twin, Mark Kelly, who is also a retired NASA astronaut. The brothers agreed to be the subjects of an unprecedented twin study; Mark stayed on Earth during Scott's eleven months aboard the ISS so that researchers could examine how an extended spaceflight affected Scott's body compared to Mark's. While Scott was in space and then continuing after he returned, both twins gave periodic blood samples and DNA swabs, and they underwent body scans and many other medical tests. In the epilogue to his 2017 book about the year long mission, Scott wrote that the very preliminary assessments of the data from the mission and from the twin study were promising: In the taste test phase of an experiment with space farming, Kelly and his fellow Expedition 44 crew-members Kjell Lindgren and Kimiya Yui are shown sampling red romaine lettuce that was grown in the Space Station's "Veggie" (or Vegetable Production) System. The Veggie series of experiments are designed to ensure that future explorers visiting the Moon, Mars or an asteroid have access to fresh produce, and also to provide them with an opportunity for relaxation and relief from stress or boredom. === Earth observatory === A Beautiful Planet provides close-up footage of the Cupola, a domed, 360 degree observation bay on the nadir (Earth-facing) side of the Station's Tranquility module / Node 3. It has seven windows in total, with six outwardly-angled windows arranged around a central, circular window which faces directly toward Earth. The circular window measures 80 centimeters in diameter; it is the largest window ever sent into space. Many scenes were filmed from the Cupola, and the astronauts themselves are shown taking photographs and gazing through its windows at views of Earth. The Cupola was constructed by the European Space Agency for the utilitarian purpose of giving astronauts a workstation where they could observe the Earth, the exterior of the Station, visiting vehicles, and the operation of the ISS robotic arms. It also serves as a rejuvenation area where astronauts can relax and seek inspiration, including communicating with other crew members. ====Training facility==== Much of the "training facility" aspect of the ISS mission is geared toward providing practical experience so that astronauts, space agencies, aerospace engineers and scientists are prepared for much longer space missions, including a possible human presence on Mars or the Moon. Astronauts on the Space Station are required to spend approximately two hours each day engaged in physical training to prevent loss of bone density, muscle atrophy, and weightlessness. In the documentary, Terry Virts is shown receiving a cardiovascular workout by running on an ISS treadmill and Samantha Cristoforetti does strength training using an ISS exercise machine that mimics weightlifting exercises. Both machines have adaptations that permit them to function in a micro-g environment. The treadmill has a harness and bungee cord straps that keep astronaut runners from floating away from it, and the "weightlifting" machine replaces the weights (which don't "weigh" anything in orbit) with two canisters that create small vacuums against which exercising astronauts can pull. The Space Station is positioned in low Earth orbit. This is just outside of the Earth's appreciable atmosphere, and provides a training area in which astronauts can put on space suits, leave the ISS life support systems behind, and conduct spacewalks - or "Extravehicular activity (EVA)." An EVA may be undertaken to make repairs, reconfigure the Station to accommodate new modules and deploy new equipment. The ISS orbits high enough to permit an astronaut and their sponsoring nation to gain an EVA experience outside of the atmosphere. However, it is low enough to avoid the increased radiation exposure and prevent difficulties associated with climbing further out of Earth's gravity well. (If the Earth is compared to a 16-inch beach ball, the orbit of the ISS would be about half an inch above the beach ball's surface.) Butch Wilmore and Terry Virts performed three spacewalks over a nine-day period from February 21 to March 1, 2015. The film depicts some of their EVA activities outside the Space Station. While they worked, both explorers were cognizant of the dangers associated with spacewalks. Virts explains that a puncture to their EMU spacesuits was a particular concern because "you 'walk around' by grabbing onto things with your gloves ... The outside of the Space Station [is] a jungle of wires and equipment and metal bars and trusses. If you accidentally sliced your glove or your spacesuit on one of the sharp edges, that could create a leak, and if that leak were big enough, you would die." Describing some of the other EVA hazards, Wilmore elaborates that the temperature is "almost 300 degrees [Fahrenheit] on the Sun side of the Space Station, [but when] you get in the shade, it's minus 275 degrees. You feel that inside the suit. My fingertips in the sunlight would feel like they were on fire almost ... [Also,] you have a safety tether attached to the Station, and it's on a reel ... You can be upside down, twisted, inverted; you can completely lose your spatial awareness about where you are and what your altitude is, and you can easily get tangled up in that safety tether if you're not cautious. Every single movement you make, you're making an effort to think [things] through." ==Production== A Beautiful Planet was written, produced, and directed by Toni Myers, who has created seven other space-themed IMAX films including Hubble 3D and Space Station 3D. The film premiered in Manhattan on April 16, 2016, and was released in cinemas on April 29, 2016. Despite being announced as distributor, Walt Disney Studios later removed association with the film prior to its release. ===Digital IMAX cameras=== The astronauts who filmed the movie used digital IMAX cameras, and much of the footage they produced was shot through the seven window panes on the Space Station's domed Cupola module. The use of digital cameras permitted cinematographer James Neihouse to review image sequences almost immediately and make suggestions for retakes, and was a lightweight alternative to using IMAX film which can be developed only when returned from space. Myers and Neihouse coordinated with their astronaut camera crew to make use of the digital cameras' augmented capacity for filming in dim light. According to Myers, "We would not have the nighttime scenes without the digital dynamic range ... What the digital capture did was totally open up that night world to us, with stars, cities at night, lightning and other phenomena that you see at night, like aurora." ==Reception== This movie received a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes and a 79% audience-enjoyment rating from the 13 reviews.Rotten Tomatoes rating for A Beautiful Planet. Retrieved December 18, 2020 The film's ratings and reviews were mostly centered around its cinematography. A review in the British newspaper, The Guardian called it a "large-format eye-opener [which] achieves a breathtaking new perspective on Earthly life," while another appraisal in The New York Times asked, "how can your eyes not bug out when given 3-D views of Earth, taken from space, on a stories-high [IMAX] screen?" ==See also== *List of films featuring space stations ==References== ==External links== * A Beautiful Planet official website * Category:2016 films Category:Documentary films about the space program of the United States Category:Documentary films about outer space Category:Films about astronauts Category:Films shot in space Category:IMAX short films Category:2016 3D films Category:2016 documentary films Category:American 3D films Category:3D short films Category:Earth in film Category:Documentary films about nature Category:Films directed by Toni Myers Category:IMAX documentary films Category:Films scored by Maribeth Solomon Category:Films scored by Micky Erbe Category:3D documentary films Category:2010s English-language films
14738411	A Beautiful Prayer	"A Beautiful Prayer" is the best-known work of Nauruan poet Joanne Gobure. ==Structure and influences== The poem shows the influence of Christian, particularly Biblical, theology, and a certain maturity of outlook, given the youth of the writer. It testifies to the writer's evident meditation on the 15th chapter of the Gospel of John, on the 8th chapter of Paul's Epistle to the Romans, and to her experience of life. It is composed mainly of similar, recurring stanzas, principally consisting of the writer's faith dialogue and the witness to her growth in spiritual understanding, in response to her various prayer petitions. ==Themes== ===Children with disabilities=== The second stanza raises an issue commanding practical human and family interest: the challenge posed to parents by, but also the prior importance of the spiritual wholeness of, children with disabilities: 'I asked God to make my handicapped child whole'. The poet subsequently attributes to God a growing appreciation of the primacy, and possibility, of her disabled child's spirit being whole: 'His spirit is whole, his body is only temporary'. ===Personhood/world paradigm=== The final lines of the poem differ somewhat from the preceding stanzas, and arguably even move beyond the strict theme of prayer: 'To the world you might be one person, But to one person you just might be the world.' In terms of broader thematic parallels, such a play on the words 'one person' and 'world' can be compared with the notion of microcosm in universality, which also expresses something of the cultural contribution of, and human interest in, the small nation of Nauru. The personhood / world dichotomy, pithily expressed here by Gobure, is also a theme taken up in writing commanding universal interest. The Evangelist John's words are apposite: 'He came into the world, and the world was made by him, and the world knew him not.' (John 1.10) ===Relevance to themes in world literature=== The simplicity of this young Nauruan writer's poem thus echoes themes in world literature in a striking manner in which comparativists in the school of Lionel Trilling and others will be able to identify. Some literary critics who see secular humanism in terms of the very nature of things would also discount the relevance of the religious imagery in this contemporary poem of Gobure. Others would recall the religious background of Nauruan society with which Gobure is identified. ==References== ==External links== * (Text of Joanne Gobure's 'A Beautiful Prayer') Category:Nauruan literature Category:Christianity in Nauru

At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 70, based on nine reviews, which indicates "generally positive reviews". Robin Murray of Clash wrote that the album "stares down the traumas that proliferate our lives, offering hope, creativity, and soul filtered through Common's profound hip-hop vision". Joe Goggins of DIY found the album "a sweet paean to music's mood-boosting properties, as well as it capacity to effect meaningful change". Ben Devlin of musicOMH wrote: "Common raps with the calm contentment of a man who's reached his destination, and it certainly sounds satisfying". Will Lavin of NME wrote: "it's rich with Afro-centric grooves and dusty drum breaks, the spirit of James Brown weaving in and out of the pro-Black messaging, which emphasises hope and progress but still acknowledges the pain and suffering endured along the way". In mixed reviews, Mojo writer resumed "an improvement on 2020's lightweight Pt. 1". Mosi Reeves of Rolling Stone wrote: "there's enough evidence on A Beautiful Revolution, Pt. 2 to suggest that he still cares about music, but it may take more than mellow bromides and Obama shout-outs to truly convince us". The Line of Best Fit reviewer wrote: "by catering to everyone in an effort to uplift, Common doesn't connect with the listener as much as he could–and as much as he has in the past. Common's big tent might be too spacious for its own good". == Track listing == == References == Category:2021 albums Category:Sequel albums Category:Common (rapper) albums Category:Loma Vista Recordings albums Category:Albums produced by Karriem Riggins

It is written by series creator Joss Whedon. ==Plot== Buffy reflects on her long history of being a Slayer and awakening the thousands of other girls around the world. In flashbacks of her narrative it is clear that in each battle the Scoobies and the others have fought came with sacrifice, but in a way, came with connection as well. Buffy admits that while it can be a bother sacrificing her life as well as others, it has always been done for the better. She has grown, she has moved on to the better and potential she always knew that she could live up to. Next, Xander and Buffy discuss a major problem: Simone Doffler. Xander tells Buffy that they tried to remove Simone from her rough, urban environment, but see her on a security tape stealing ammunition and other things in a robbery, the unconscious bodies of two guards are also found in the tapes. Buffy feels worried that she is not making a big change in the Slayer community and feels that what the government and everyone else thinks is true, slayers are acting above the law and she is not making the difference she says she is making. Xander comforts her and reassures her that things are going to be all right. The two then reflect on the revelation that Buffy stole from a lucrative bank to support her and the Slayer army and how she and Willow are having complex issues. Xander suggests that she ease her worries by going on a vampire hunt; Buffy decides to bring a "date", namely Satsu. While the other Slayers and giant Dawn are celebrating at a huge party to ease their recent stresses, Buffy gears up to go on her vampire hunt. Satsu follows and Buffy forces her into the vampire lair. While the two are slaying, Buffy discusses how she knows that it was Satsu who gave her the kiss of true love when Buffy was bound in a magical sleep. While Buffy appreciates the gesture as kind and sweet, she is not interested in Satsu in a romantic way. Buffy tells Satsu of her romantic history and how all of her relationships, be it romantic, family, or friends, end with someone being hurt. Buffy states that there is something wrong with her, that everyone notices that something around her is wrong, that she can never really love, and like all Slayers, will be alone. She breaks down in tears but the moment is interrupted with a surprise attack from the malevolent Twilight. Satsu is knocked out, while Buffy and Twilight have a brawl in the air. Twilight bests Buffy in battle with moves she has never witnessed and takes her fear of flight to a whole new level by taking the fight into the air above the town. When he is about to throw the steeple of a church at her, Buffy tells him that killing her will only bring more Slayers to the call, that there will only be more to deal with. It is revealed that Twilight does not want to kill Buffy, yet. He wants to talk to her. He reveals that one Slayer in the world was enough to deal with, thousands is not tolerated. Specifically, he states that the world cannot contain them and eventually everyone will suffer for their existence. Twilight further feeds Buffy's insecurities by stating that they haven't changed the world or made a true difference. He flies off before the rising of the Sun, while Buffy rushes back to the graveyard that she and Satsu were in to help Satsu. While Satsu feels she has failed Buffy, Buffy comforts her. In an unknown base, Twilight tells his comrades that to truly defeat the Slayer, one must strip her of her greatest armor, her moral certainty. They must twist her view of right and wrong, or twist the views of the ones she helps. Back in Scotland, in an infirmary, a bedridden and bandaged Satsu expresses her disappointment to a bandaged Buffy. Satsu understands Buffy's view on love and ask if she is hurt, Buffy states that she will eventually heal, that together they will heal. Buffy talks to Xander of her confrontation with Twilight and how he was stronger than anything she has encountered so far. She expresses the fears that Twilight released in her, that she was not making a difference. Buffy feels that she is not making a difference, that the girls she awakened weren't and that she did not have any connection with them. Xander assures her that Buffy awakened confidence and purpose that the girls never had before. Buffy jokes that Xander should just ask Renee out already, while Xander jokes that she should not state the obvious and that she should not change the subject. He assures to Buffy that what she created is more than a monster-fighting army, it is a connected state. Buffy still feels she has no connection amongst the girls, Xander replies that it is not she that is supposed to, the person who brought all of it together gave up her connection so that the others would feel it, so that the other chosen girls could feel like they had a place to fit in, a place where they belonged. Buffy agrees, and in contrast to the opening sees that what she did truly was for the better. == Production == Writer Joss Whedon continues as writer from the last issue. Georges Jeanty returns as penciller since the No Future For You story arc. Drawing sequences from the episode "Chosen" are used as flashbacks in the beginning of the story. Including the Slayer who was playing baseball, Willow tapping into the essence of the Slayer Scythe, Rona and Vi being chosen, and Buffy fighting Caleb. ==Canonical issues== This series has been described as 'canon' by both Whedon and various commentators. As the creator of Buffy, Joss Whedon's association with Buffyverse story is often linked to how canonical the various stories are. Since Whedon is writing this story, it will be seen as a continuation of the official continuity established by Buffy and Angel. Season Eight contradicts and supersedes information given in the paperback novels set after Season Seven, such as Queen of the Slayers and Dark Congress, which are described as being set in an unofficial "parallel" continuity.Mata, Shiai, "CHRISTOPHER GOLDEN INTERVIEW 2 ", SlayerLit.us (2007). Twilight references Buffy killing Caleb in "Chosen" using the scythe by slicing him in two from the crotch up. The mud on Satsu's face mirrors the sequence in "Restless" in which Buffy spreads mud across her face. Intended to be set after BtVS's seventh season. The precise timing of this arc is currently uncertain. ==References== Category:Comics by Joss Whedon

62695113	A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor	A Beautifully Foolish Endeavor is a science fiction novel by American author Hank Green that was published on July 7, 2020. Green's second novel, also starring main character April May, is the sequel to An Absolutely Remarkable Thing and the final installment in the Carl Saga. ==Plot summary== Following April May's sudden death, her friends Andy, Robin, and Miranda, and her ex- girlfriend Maya, grapple with how the world has changed since her disappearance. Andy has been publicly speaking with Robin as his agent and Miranda has returned to her studies at Berkeley to continue the process of getting her PhD. However, Maya refuses to believe April is dead. The public has largely moved on from her absence, and from Carl's sudden disappearance, but dealing with withdrawals from the sudden absence of the Dream, many individuals sign up for games that attempt to mimic the simulations of the Dream in real life. After receiving the text "Knock knock" from April's phone number, Andy answers the door to find a book known as The Book of Good Times. As Andy reads, he realizes the book is predicting/telling him what he is doing/going to do. It warns him not to tell anyone about it or it will not work, and instructs him to invest certain ways, ask out Bex (the girl who works at his local Subway), and tell Miranda "yes" when she calls. He follows the instructions because he believes they will lead him to April. Eventually, Miranda calls him to get his opinion on whether or not she should apply to work at Altus, a company headed by Peter Petrawicki, April's nemesis. Miranda intends to spy on Petrawicki's company and commit espionage, believing they are up to something dangerous. Against his better judgement, Andy tells Miranda she should apply. Miranda applies to Altus and is flown out soon after. She learns each applicant is only allowed to send out a single 400 word email to their family letting them know they're alright, and no one can leave. She is taken to a Demo room along with other applicants, where they are given headsets that take them into the Altus Space; a simulation that mimics the Dream. However, someone in Miranda's group gets sick and is visibly unsettled. Peter Petrawicki explains this is called "body dislocation" and occurs when the consciousness does not enter the "body" in the program properly, but promises it is rare as anyone who experiences "body dislocation" will never be able to enter the Altus Spaceit will happen every time they try again. After nearly dying in the warehouse fire, April was slowly reconstructed by Carl. Half of her face and most of her body are made of a nearly unbreakable, white, iridescent substance. It has been melded into her anatomy, but looks inhuman. April is initially frightened and hysterical, so she leaves, which is when she finds Maya, who had driven to New Jersey based on conspiracies about April on the Som. They hide in a motel when a man breaks in with a gun, and Carl intervenes. After escaping, they stay in an empty school building for a few days. Carl explains they were sent to stop humanity from self destructing, but when April was nearly killed, their brother stepped in. Their brother, acting through Altus, has started reining humanity in, as planned if Carl failed. Human free will, Carl concludes, will be lost forever if Altus is not taken down in time. Unknown to Miranda and the other workers at Altus, the Altus program has already been released to the public. Andy is quickly addicted to it, noticing people outside less and less. Eventually, a new copy of The Book of Good Times arrives, and following its instructions, he is reunited with April and Maya. Robin arrives soon after, revealing he also had his own copy of The Book of Good Times. Knowing Altus must be taken down, the four begin to plan. Peter Petrawicki personally shows Miranda Altus Premium. Unlike the public Altus Space, Premium allows one to experience the thoughts of another person by inhabiting their memory. Peter then takes her to the "servers" where she sees people who are "mining", all of whom are glued to their headsets and live as if quarantined without ever leaving the Altus Space. Miranda is locked in a separate area. With no company, she begins to use Altus as her one outlet into the world. She believes she is waking up, but eventually she realizes she has been barred from leaving and has been in Altus for days, if not weeks. She manages to leave a message for Andy in one of her constructed simulations. Andy contacts April and Maya, who are already heading to Val Verde to take down Altus. Initially, it seems their plan is going well; April confronts Peter, Maya wakes up Miranda, and Carl hacks into the wifi so Andy can receive video of what is happening at the Altus headquarters. However, their plan to convince the public that Altus was immoral falls apart, as most people are too addicted to care. Miranda is possessed by Carl's brother, as the rest of the people trapped in Altus are, and she nearly kills Maya. Carl uses the last of their energy to free Miranda from their sibling, and Miranda is able to enact her last minute plan to lock people out of Altus. Whenever an update is installed to Altus, everyone logged on experiences it, and everyone not logged on experiences it as soon as they log on. Miranda finds a coworker who experienced body dislocation and uploads his memory as an update, so everyone logged on or logging in immediately experiences body dislocation. Since body dislocation only has to happen once for it to happen every time, no one is able to return to Altus Space, effectively shutting down Altus. Andy is the most upset with the removal of Altus, but over time he comes to accept it and finds happiness with Bex. Miranda returns to Berkeley, leading a team of a few friends she made while working at Altus. April and Maya move into a house together and take care of the monkey Carl once inhabited. Carl is gone, but they find one last copy of The Book of Good Times in Maya's potato plant. In it, Carl tells them their brother is still watching, still monitoring, still seeing if humanity needs to be reined in, but is otherwise dormant. ==Reception== The book has received mostly positive reviews. According to Book Marks, 60% of reviewers gave the novel rave reviews, while 20% reviewed it positively, and another 20% expressed mixed feelings. This is a notable step up from the reception of An Absolutely Remarkable Thing, which (according to Book Marks) received only 25% rave reviews. Delfina V Barbiero of USA Today gave the book out of4 stars, noting that "Green gives nuance to the privileges of escapism with humor and grace through main characters taking a chance on hope, even if it is beautifully foolish." ==References== Category:2020 American novels Category:Books by Hank Green Category:Dutton Penguin books

Like any smart immigrant, McDonagh knows that by going after Toby’s otherness he becomes less of an outsider himself." Ben Brantley, in his review for The New York Times noted that the typical McDonagh characters "start to seem alarmingly like figures from a conventional Hollywood caper comedy about dopey, foul-mouthed crooks who keep tripping over themselves... If Mr. McDonagh hasn’t provided the kind of exhilarating, nasty fun house we have come to expect of him, we are at least allowed to spend shivery time in that shabby, scary labyrinth that exists behind Carmichael’s glassy forehead." == Awards and nominations == Walken was nominated for the 2010 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play, the 2010 Outer Critics Circle Award, Outstanding Actor in a Play, and the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Play.

33277726	A Behavioral Theory of the Firm	The behavioral theory of the firm first appeared in the 1963 book A Behavioral Theory of the Firm by Richard M. Cyert and James G. March. The work on the behavioral theory started in 1952 when March, a political scientist, joined Carnegie Mellon University, where Cyert was an economist. Before this model was formed, the existing theory of the firm had two main assumptions: profit maximization and perfect knowledge. Cyert and March questioned these two critical assumptions. ==Background== A behavioral model of rational choice by Herbert A. Simon paved the way for the behavioral model. Neo-classical economists assumed that firms enjoyed perfect information. In addition the firm maximized profits and did not suffer from internal resource allocation problems. Advocates of the behavioral approach also challenged the omission of the element of uncertainty from the conventional theory. The behavioral model, like the managerial models of Oliver E. Williamson and Robin Marris, considers a large corporate business firm in which the ownership is separate from the management. ===Cyert and March=== These researchers offered four major research themes: *A small number of key economic decisions *Development of a general theory, generalizing the results from studies of specific firms *Linkage of empirical data to models *Orientation towards process rather than outcomes ==Model framework== ===Theory construction=== The behavioral approach takes the firm as the basic unit of analysis. It attempts to predict behaviour with respect to price, output and resource allocation decisions. It emphasizes the decision-making process. ===The firm as a coalition of groups=== The theory argues that while small firms may operate under the guidance of the entrepreneur, such a simple model does not describe larger corporations. These larger firms are coalitions of individuals or groups, which may include managers, stockholders, workers, suppliers and so on. According to Cyert and March, these groups participate in setting goals and making decisions. Priorities and information may vary by group, potentially creating conflicts. Cyert and March mentioned five goals which real world firms generally possess: production; inventory; market share; sales and profits. According to the behavioral theory, all the goals must be satisfied, following an implicit order of priority among them. ===Satisficing behaviour=== Cyert and March proposed that real firms aim at satisficing rather than maximizing their results. I.e., some groups may settle for "good enough" achievements rather than striving for the best possible outcome. This came from a concept known as bounded rationality, which was developed by Herbert Simon. Bounded rationality means prudent behaviour under a given set of circumstances. In this model goals are not set to maximize relevant magnitudes such as profits, sales and market share. Instead, goals are compromises negotiated by the groups. ===The process of decision making=== In the model, top management sets the goals of the organization. But these goals are implemented through decision making at two levels, one at the top and the second at lower management levels. During approval of proposals of various departments, two criteria are generally employed. A financial measure assesses the availability of the required funds given resources. An improvement measure assesses whether the proposal improves the health of the organization. According to Cyert and March, information is required to take the most appropriate decisions. However, information gathering itself is not Costless and requires resources. ===Organizational slack=== To keep the various groups in the organization, payments had to be in excess of what was required for the efficient working of the firm. The difference between the total resources and the necessary payments is called the organizational slack. In conventional economic theory organizational slack is zero, at least at equilibrium. Cyert and March claim that organizational slack plays a stabilizing and adaptive role. Cyert and March gave many examples of organizational slack such as high dividends paid to shareholders, prices set lower than necessary and wages paid in excess of those required. ==Critical evaluation== The behavioral model made a great impact on the theory of the firm. It gave insights in the process of goal formation and fixation of aspiration levels and resource allocation. Its critics claim that the theory is unnecessarily complicated. The virtual assembly of the firm, with the decision-making process as the unit, for the purpose of predicting their behaviour is highly questioned by critics. There has also been staunch support for profit maximization rather than satisficing behaviour, which is one of the core elements of the model. ==Later research== The behavioral theory of the firm has become important for much later research in organization theory and management, and has led to empirical studies and simulation modeling in organizational learning, as well as work on the cognitive foundations of firm strategy. ==See also== *Theory of the firm *Carnegie School ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * Category:Works about management Category:Business economics Category:Economics books Category:Behavioral economics Category:Books about organizations
27906562	A Bekkersdal Marathon	thumb|First edition A Bekkersdal Marathon is anthology of short stories written by Herman Charles Bosman. ==Publication History== The 22 short stories assembled in this volume, published in book format in 1971 by Human and Rousseau, were all written during the last 18 months of Herman Charles Bosman's life Bosman, HC (1971) A Bekkersdal Marathon. Cape Town: Human and Rousseau. . Originally, the stories appeared as a weekly serial in ‘The Forum’ magazine. ==Synopsis== After leaving university, Bosman was appointed as a school teacher in the Groot Marico District. In small, underdeveloped rural towns, such as the one where Bosman worked, the living room (‘voorkamer’) of a local farmer would serve as a post office. People would often gather here to chat and gossip. The conversations he participated in with the townspeople and farmers inspired the anthology. In ‘A Bekkersdal Marathon’, the ‘voorkkamer’ of Jurie Steyn, a prosperous maize farmer, doubles as the village post office. Regular visitors include Gysbert van Tonder (a notorious cattle rustler), At Naude (the owner of the district's only radio who prides himself on keeping abreast of national and world affairs) and Oupa Bekker (the oldest man in the District). Vermaak, the school master, represents Bosman himself. Bosman uses gentle irony to poke fun at the Afrikaans farmers. Outwardly, the farmers project an image of conservative respectability which contrasts with their inner natures. The plots, language and content of the stories help the reader to look beneath the veneer and to understand the farmers as scheming, greedy, superstitious, provincial country bumpkins. Hypocritically, they routinely criticize Black people and English South Africans for foibles and failings which the farmers themselves display in ample measure. Bosman did not spare himself in the stories; Vermaak is depicted as occasionally naïve and his idiosyncrasies are discussed at length in the stories. == References == Category:South African short story collections Category:1971 short story collections

He also added, "not even [Meaney's] heavyweight gravitas can save A Belfast Story from its weak script, sluggish pacing and one-dimensional characters." Steve Rose of The Guardian gave the film 2 stars out of 5 and wrote, "the plot scatters too many pieces about, putting the film's star off screen for long stretches." ==Controversy== A month before its release, the film garnered controversy in Great Britain for the filmmakers' publicity stunt of sending a nail bomb kit to the media to promote the film.

6300991	A Believer Sings the Truth	A Believer Sings the Truth is a gospel double album and 63rd overall album by American country singer Johnny Cash. The tracks for the double-length album were all recorded in 1979. Cash was under contract to Columbia Records, but the label was doubtful that a double-album of gospel songs was commercially viable. With the label's blessing, Cash was allowed to release it on his own on the Cachet label and as a radio special with added narration. His efforts paid off, as the album made it into the Country Top 50, peaking at #43. In 1982, Columbia reissued the album itself, and in 1984 an edited-down version titled I Believe appeared on Arrival Records (see below). Prior to 2012 the only CD release of tracks from the album occurred with two tracks appearing in the God portion of the 2004 box set Love, God, Murder (a set compiled by Cash soon before his death in 2003), and two more tracks appeared on 2007's Ultimate Gospel. The complete contents of the album (plus a previously unreleased outtake) made their CD debut as Disk 1 of the 2012 release Bootleg Vol. IV: The Soul of Truth. It is one of only a handful of Columbia-related albums not to be included in the 2012 box set release Johnny Cash: The Complete Columbia Album Collection. ==Track listing== ==Charts== Album - Billboard (United States) Year Chart Position December 1979 Country Albums 43 ==I Believe== thumb|right|I Believe album cover In 1984, I Believe was released on the Arrival Records label, featuring ten songs from A Believer Sings the Truth and four outtakes from the same sessions.

1526243	A Bell Is a Cup	A Bell Is a Cup... Until It Is Struck is the fifth studio album by the British post-punk group Wire. ==Critical response== In 1989, the Trouser Press Record Guide described the album as "a stylized set of dreamscapes and consciousness streams… It's arguably Wire's most ruminative album, and while immersion in it won't, as 'Silk Skin Paws' suggests, 'wring your senses' – that's more a job for Chairs Missing – it will twirl your lobes a time or two." However, in a later edition, Trouser Press held a more critical view, writing "Wire stayed the dance-pop course with diminishing results on A Bell Is a Cup." At the time of the album's release, Wire faced accusations that they had abandoned their earlier rough-edged sound for a softer, more refined style. Graham Lewis dismissed such criticism: AllMusic gave the album a laudatory review, describing the record as "arguably Wire's best album and certainly its most accessible… a work of modern rock genius." ==Cover art== The sculpture shown is the Selene horse from the Parthenon Marbles. ==Track listing== All tracks published by Stainless Music.

1801543	A Bell for Adano	A Bell for Adano is a 1945 American war film directed by Henry King and starring John Hodiak and Gene Tierney. It was adapted from the 1944 novel of the same title by John Hersey, which won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1945. In his review of the film for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther wrote, "... this easily vulnerable picture, which came to the Music Hall yesterday, is almost a perfect picturization of Mr. Hersey's book." In addition to the Broadway play (Cort Theatre, (12/06/1944 - 10/27/1945), which starred Fredric March, there have been several other versions of the story. In a 1955 Lux Video Theatre adaptation, Edmond O'Brien had the lead, with a young Charles Bronson playing the part William Bendix took in the movie. Barry Sullivan and Anna Maria Alberghetti were in a 1956 CBS telecast, and John Forsythe played the major in a 1967 Hallmark Hall of Fame broadcast. ==Plot== The story concerns Italian-American U.S. Army Major Joppolo (John Hodiak), who is placed in charge of the town of Adano during the invasion of Sicily. Major Joppolo asks the town elders what the town needs most: some say food but most say "a bell" and his curiosity is raised. The priest explains that the whole heart of the town's activities centred upon the bell ringing. He then starts a long struggle to replace the 700-year-old bell that was taken from the town by the Fascists at the start of the war to be melted down for weapons. Through his actions, Joppolo also wins the trust and love of the people. Some of the changes Joppolo brings into the town include: * Democracy * Free fishing privilege * The freedom of mule carts * A bell from the American Navy to replace the town bell The short-tempered American commander, General Marvin, fires Major Joppolo from his position when Joppolo disobeys an order to prohibit mule cart traffic in Adano, which has been disrupting Allied supply trucks, because the mule carts are vital to the survival of the town. The character of Joppolo was based on the real life experiences of Frank Toscani, who was military governor of the town of Licata, Sicily after the Allied invasion.Martin, Douglass.

13455232	A Bell for Adano (novel)	A Bell for Adano is a 1944 novel by John Hersey, the winner of the 1945 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. It tells the story of an Italian-American officer in Sicily during World War II who wins the respect and admiration of the people of the town of Adano by helping them find a replacement for the town bell that the Fascists had melted down for rifle barrels. ==Plot summary== The novel is set during the 1943 Allied occupation of the fictional Italian coastal town of Adano (based on the real city of Licata). The main character, Major Victor Joppolo, is the temporary administrator of the town during the occupation and is often referred to by the people of Adano as Mister Major. Joppolo is an idealistic Italian-American who wants to bring justice and compassion to Adano, which has been hardened by the authoritarian Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. When Major Joppolo arrives at Adano, he immediately asks the people of the town what they need the most. The first spokesman of the town tells Joppolo that they are in great need of food for some people have not eaten in days. The second spokesman of the town argues that the town's immediate necessity is a new bell. Joppolo is touched by the story of a 700-year-old bell that was taken away from the town by the Fascists. Mussolini had ordered that the bell be removed from the town and be melted to make weapons for the war. The people were greatly attached to the bell. To them, the bell was a source of pride and unity. Joppolo immediately sees the importance of the bell and makes persistent attempts to locate the bell. In addition to finding the bell, Joppolo spends time trying to supply the town with food and other necessities. He soon discovers that the town has no fish because the fishermen have not gone out in months. When he speaks to Tomasino, the leader of the fishermen, Joppolo finds out that this is because the fisherman were forced to pay 'protection' money to the corrupt Fascist government simply to go out fishing. Joppolo tells Tomasino that he will not have to pay any bribes or extra taxes to the Americans for fishing. At first, Tomasino is convinced that Joppolo is lying to him and that it is some sort of cruel trick. Tomasino hates persons of authority because he believes that they are all power-hungry and corrupt. It takes extensive persuading to convince Tomasino that Joppolo's intentions are good and that his only want is for the people of Adano to have fish. Joppolo is faced with another problem in which he had to countermand the order of General Marvin in order to do what was best for the town. General Marvin is an army general who happens to pass through Adano. All day his armored car has been slowed by mule carts that are blocking the road. Finally, on the road to Adano, he loses his temper and orders that his men shoot a mule that refuses to move from the center of the road. When General Marvin arrived at Adano, he orders Major Joppolo to keep all mule carts out of the town. Joppolo is disheartened but complies with the order. Immediately, he calls for a meeting with all the officials of the town and tells them of the new order, but also that he is prepared to find a solution. The next day, Joppolo decides that countermanding General Marvin's order is more important than his own position as mayor of the town; therefore he tells the people of Adano that they may bring their carts into the town (among other things, the town has no source of water without the carts). Later in the novel, Joppolo gains the admiration of U.S. Navy Lieutenant Livingston, who invites Joppolo to come have a drink with some of his Navy buddies. While there, Joppolo tells them of the town's need for a bell. Commander Robertson realizes that they might have exactly the bell that Adano needs, aboard the USS Corelli. The arrival of the bell to the town coincides with a party that the town is hosting for Joppolo to express their gratitude for all of his great doings. Although the bell has arrived at the town, the engineers say that it will take them until the next morning to install it. At the same time Sergeant Borth, one of Major Joppolo's aides, finds a note from General Marvin that says that Joppolo has been relieved of duty as administrator of Adano because he countermanded General Marvin's order. Sergeant Borth tells Joppolo that he has been relieved from duty while they are at the party and hands Joppolo the order. The next morning, Joppolo leaves Adano, but does not say goodbye to anyone because he does not think he could. As the jeep is driving away, he tells the driver to stop for a moment. They hear the clear sound of a loud bell. ==Characters== Major Victor Joppolo: The protagonist of the story, is the interim mayor of the Italian coastal town of Adano. He is sincerely interested in restoring happiness and prosperity and goes to great lengths to satisfy the people's needs. Sergeant Borth: A sergeant in the Military Police platoon assigned to garrison Adano; admires the major's changes to the town. Captain Purvis: Under Major Joppolo and the officer in charge of the military police in Adano. General Marvin: General of the American 34th Infantry Division in Italy. He orders that all carts stay out of Adano and relieves Major Joppolo of his position when he discovers that the major countermanded his order. Tina: The daughter of Tomasino, Major Joppolo develops an affinity for her over the course of the novel, even though it may be because she wants the major to find out whether her sweetheart is still alive. Giuseppe: Major Joppolo's interpreter. Zito: Major Joppolo's usher. Tomasino: The leader of the fishermen. Tomasino, though skeptical at first, is thrilled when Major Joppolo allows him and his men to go out and fish. Cacopardo: A rich man, he owns the sulfur refinery of Adano. His chiasmus seen throughout the book: "Cacopardo is sulphur and sulphur is Cacopardo." Mercurio Salvatore: The crier of the town. Gargano: Chief of the police in Adano. Mayor Nasta: Former fascist mayor of Adano, he comes back to the town and is ridiculed by all. Lieutenant Livingston: A United States Navy lieutenant, he is in charge of the port of Adano. ==Reception== A Bell for Adano was published in 1944 and won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945. Time magazine in 1944 wrote, "The mood of A Bell for Adano is bitter. Its humor is raucous and wild. At its worst, it descends to college humorous magazine slapstick. At its best it is a superb piece of reporting. Read unimaginatively, it is a deadly account of U.S. official incompetence. Stripped of its humor, it is the story of a battle for democracy, no less real for being fought without arms, more important than the military engagement that preceded it."Knopf. A Bell for Adano. Time Magazine, February 21, 1944 Kenneth Dave Schadt of the Vancouver Public Library later noted, "The novel achieved huge popularity and was hailed as a classic war novel. The book is rich in characterization, and it is recognized as a classic study in leadership. Another possible reason it was so well received was that the novel portrays the American army in a positive light and shows how democracy is inherently superior to Fascism." ==Connections to World War II== thumb|Treno armato Licata thumb Adano is a fictional Sicilian port town modeled after the real town of Licata, Sicily, one of the disembarkation towns on the beaches of Mollarella and Poliscia during the Allied occupation of Italy. Just like Adano in the novel, Licata has a shipping and sulfur industry and a fishing port, and its largest church is the Church of Sant'Angelo. Additionally, Benito Mussolini did have Licata's 700-year-old bell melted to make ammunition.Rasmussen, R. Kent. Cyclopedia of Literary Places, 2003 Major Joppolo is based on the American military governor of Licata named Frank E. Toscani. John Hersey visited Toscani for four or five days during the war and created Victor Joppolo from him, noting that he held a job as a civilian clerk in the New York City Sanitation Department.Martin, Douglass (January 28, 2001). The New York Times: "F.E. Toscani 89, Dies; Model for Hero of 'Bell for Adano'". General Marvin is a depiction of the World War II General Patton, who was known for his bitterness and cruelty, but also his effectiveness. ==Adaptations== The novel was the basis of Paul Osborn's 1944 Broadway play A Bell for Adano, starring Fredric March. A film version of the novel, A Bell for Adano (1945), starred John Hodiak. A Bell for Adano was presented on Star Playhouse on October 11, 1953. March starred in the adaptation. On June 2, 1956, CBS Television broadcast a version of Hersey's story, starring Barry Sullivan and Anna Maria Alberghetti and directed by Paul Nickell. On November 15, 1967, Hallmark Hall of Fame broadcast a version starring John Forsythe and Murray Hamilton and directed by Mel Ferrer. ==References== ==Sources== * Huey, Peggy J. "A Bell for Adano."

46970826	A Bend in the Ganges	A Bend in the Ganges (1964) is a novel by the Indian author Manohar Malgonkar.Ashok Kumar Bachchan, "A Bend in the Ganges: A Historical Novel" in Basavaraj Naikar (ed.), Indian English Literature, Volume 6, Atlantic Publishers & Distributors, 2007, p. 140. The novel opens with the civil disobedience movement of the early 1930s and ends with the partition riots in Punjab. It encompasses the Swadeshi movement, the activities of the freedom fighters, the outbreak of the Second World War, the British retreat from Rangoon, the Bombay dock explosion and the division of India in 1947. The epigraph of this novel is from the Ramayana: "At a bend in the Ganges, they paused to take a look at the land they were leaving". This story revolves around three male protagonists: Gian Talwar- who is very much influenced by the Gandhian ideology of non-violence; Debi Dayal and Shafi Usman are other two who often uses "Jai-Ram: Jai Rahim" slogan to equate their feeling toward secularism. The fundamental difference between Talwar and Debi-Shafi duo lies in their ideology. As Talwar picks 'Gandhian nonviolence' as his way to fight against the British atrocities, Debi-Shafi finds violence as the only option left. Freedom fighters also establish 'The Hanuman Club', an institution for their physical and spiritual upliftment in a country which is immensely divided due to its variations in political ideology and religious fragility. ==References== Category:1964 novels Category:1964 Indian novels
853877	A Bend in the River	A Bend in the River is a 1979 novel by Nobel laureate V. S. Naipaul. The novel, telling the story of Salim, a merchant in post-colonial mid-20th century Africa, is one of Naipaul's best known works and was widely praised. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1979. In 1998, the Modern Library ranked A Bend in the River #83 on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. A Bend in the River has also been criticized for a perceived defence of European colonialism in Africa. ==Plot== Set in an unnamed African country after independence, the book is narrated by Salim, an ethnically Indian Muslim and a shopkeeper in a small but growing city in the country's remote interior. Salim observes the rapid changes in Africa with an outsider's distance. Salim grows up in the community of Indian traders on the east coast of Africa. Feeling insecure about his future in East Africa, he buys a business from Nazruddin in a town at "a bend in the river" in the heart of Africa. When he moves there he finds the town decrepit, a "ghost town", its former European suburb reclaimed by the bush, and many of its European vestiges ruined in a "rage" by the locals in response to their suppression and humiliation during colonial times. Old tribal distinctions have become important again. Salim trades in what people in the villages need: pencils and paper, pots and pans, other household utensils. Soon he is joined by an assistant, Metty, who comes from a family of house slaves his family had maintained in the east. One of his steady customers is Zabeth, a "marchande" from a village and a magician too. Zabeth has a son, Ferdinand, by a man of another tribe, and asks Salim to help him get educated. Ferdinand attends the local lycée run by Father Huismans, a Belgian priest who collects African masks and is considered a "lover of Africa". Life in the town is slowly improving. Salim's decision to move there seems to be vindicated when he learns that the Indian community on the east coast is being persecuted, but he still does not feel secure. Mahesh says of the local Africans that "they are malins", "because they lived with the knowledge of men as prey". A rebellion breaks out and the Indian merchants live in fear. Soon white mercenaries appear and restore order. After peace has returned Father Huismans goes on a trip. He is killed by unknown assailants and nobody cares. Afterwards his collection of African masks is denounced as affront to African religion. An American visitor pillages most of the masks and ships them home as "The richest products of the forest". The town now develops into a trading centre for the region. Government agencies spring up. European salesmen and visitors arrive. Salim's friends Mahesh and Shoba become successful with their new Bigburger franchise. The new army arrives, "poachers of ivory and thieves of gold". Portraits of the President, "the Big Man", are displayed everywhere. A new section of town is built, the "State Domain", to showcase the President's vision of a new Africa. Yet buildings are shoddy, the tractors at the agricultural centre never get put to work, and much of the Domain falls quickly into disrepair. Salim calls it a "hoax". The Domain is soon converted into a university and conference centre. Salim is visited by Indar, who grew up with him on the east coast, then went to England to study and now has become a lecturer at the new institution. He takes Salim to a party in the Domain to meet Yvette and Raymond. Raymond had been the advisor and mentor of the President. Although he is in charge of the Domain, he finds himself outside the centre of power. Loyal to the President, he continues to write for him, hoping to be recalled to the capital. Salim, whose experience with women has been limited to prostitutes, is intrigued by Yvette, Raymond's much younger wife. Later, after Indar departs with the steamer, Salim and Yvette start an adulterous affair right under Raymond's eyes. Eventually the liaison breaks down, Salim hitting her and spitting on her between the legs. Raymond's attempts to please the Big Man are not successful. Instead the President publishes "a very small, brief book of thoughts, Maximes, two or three thoughts to each page, each thought about four or five lines long". Like others, Salim is forced to buy copies of the book for distribution. The local youth group displeases the President and is denounced in one of his propaganda speeches. As a result, unrest grows, corruption and extortion become more prevalent, and a "Liberation Army" forms underground. They reject the President, his cult of the black Madonna, his vision of Africa, and want to return to the "truthful laws" of the ancestors. Salim looks for a way out. He travels to London, where he meets Nazruddin. Nazruddin sold his business to Salim, moved to Uganda, left it because of persecution, moved then to Canada, left it because of its capitalistic rapaciousness, and finally landed in London, where he became a landlord. He bemoans the lack of security for honest businessmen: there is no safe place. Salim becomes engaged to Nazruddin's daughter, but soon returns to his place in Africa. Upon arrival he learns that his business has been expropriated under the President's new programme of "radicalization" and transferred to a local. Théotime, a "state trustee", is ignorant and lazy, and retains Salim as manager and chauffeur. Salim recognises that all is lost. He has hidden some ivory on his property, but, betrayed by Metty, is found out and put in jail. He is presented to the commissioner, Ferdinand, who has moved up in the administration after receiving training in the capital. Ferdinand tells him that there is no safety, no hope, and that everybody is in fear of his life: "We’re all going to hell, and every man knows this in his bones. We’re being killed. Nothing has any meaning." He sets Salim free and tells him to leave the country. Salim takes the last steamer before the President arrives. During the night there is a battle on the ship, as rebels try to kidnap it. The attack is repelled, but the attached barge, full of Africans, is snapped loose and drifts down the river. ==Latin mottos== This Latin phrase is still visible to Salim on the granite base of a ruined European monument near the dock. Later Father Huismans explains him its meaning. "He approves of the mingling of the peoples and their bonds of union", derived from Virgil's Aeneid, Book IV, line 112. Aeneas lands on the shores of Africa, falls in love with Queen Dido and wants to settle, putting his mission, the migration to Italy, in danger. The gods intervene: they do not approve of a settlement in Africa nor of the mingling of the peoples. In the motto, however, three words were altered to reverse the original meaning. A second Latin phrase is encountered by Salim: , the motto of the lycée. The original phrase by Pliny the Elder meant that there is always something new out of Africa (ex Africa). Huismans applied it jokingly to the unique masks and carvings with religious quality he had collected. ==Comments== Naipaul is recognised as a "magnificent novelist", and A Bend in the River has been described as a "full-bodied masterpiece". Yet he has been accused of being a "neo-colonialist", and in this novel post-colonial Africa is depicted as spiralling into a kind of Hell. He has also been accused of being "infected by an ancestral communal resentment" against blacks. Whitaker indicates that Salim's plight as an outsider, a member of the Indian community in Africa, is credibly rendered, but takes Naipaul to task for ascribing to African people a "mysterious malevolence". Irving Howe admires Naipaul's "almost Conradian gift for tensing a story", the psychic and moral tension of the novel, and its "serious involvement with human issues". Howe rejects the notion that Naipaul is an apologist of colonialism. He contrasts the foreground space occupied by Salim with the background acts set in motion by the Big Man. The Big Man never appears but finds a voice in Raymond, the white intellectual who gets dumped later. Howe bemoans the fact that, as he sees it, Naipaul offers no hope, and that he allows "the wretchedness of his depicted scene" to become "the limit of his vision". Selwyn Cudjoe thinks that the novel depicts "the gradual darkening of African society as it returns to its age-old condition of bush and blood" and thinks this pessimistic view indicates Naipaul's "inability to examine postcolonial societies in any depth". The novel examines "the homeless condition of the East Indian in a world he cannot call home" and shows in Salim's case his passage to free himself from "the constricting ties to his society's past". Imraan Coovadia examines Naipaul's Latin quotations, accuses him of misquotation and manipulation, and suggests that he tries to evoke fear, disgust and condescension. Raja suggests that the novel is less about a conflict of modernity and Third World development, but more about a representation from a bourgeois perspective, Salim being interested, not in revolutionary goals, but in maintaining a profitable enterprise. He asserts that Naipaul is not a postcolonial author but a "cosmopolitan" one (as defined by Timothy Brennan), who offers an "inside view of formerly submerged peoples" for target audiences that have "metropolitan literary tastes". In 2001, without specifically referring to this novel, the Nobel Literature Prize Committee indicated that it viewed Naipaul as Conrad's heir as the annalist of the destinies of empires in the moral sense: what they do to human beings. In Heart of Darkness, Joseph Conrad presented a dark picture of the same region at the beginning of European colonization; this type of depiction of Africa is also found recast in Naipaul's novel. Like Conrad, who in Heart of Darkness does not name the big river, Naipaul does not name the river in this novel, nor the town at its bend, nor the country or its president. Yet there are possible identifiers. Thus the reader learns that the town is located in the heart of Africa, at the end of the navigable river, just below the cataracts, and the European colonisers had been French-speaking, perhaps Belgians. Naipaul's description has been interpreted to point to the town of Kisangani on the Congo river. A link between the "Big Man" and President Mobutu of Zaire was drawn by some reviewers. Naipaul credits his extramarital affair with Margaret Gooding for giving A Bend in the River and his later books greater fluidity, saying that these "in a way to some extent depend on her. They stopped being dry.” A Bend in the River was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, but did not win; it is discussed by two characters in The Inheritance of Loss by Kiran Desai, which did win the prize, in 2006. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Literary Encyclopedia entry Category:1979 British novels Category:Novels by V.

8079104	A Benihana Christmas	"A Benihana Christmas" is the tenth and eleventh episodes of the third season of the American comedy television series The Office, and the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth episodes overall. It was written by Jennifer Celotta and directed by Harold Ramis. The episode originally aired in the United States on December 14, 2006, on NBC. In the episode, Christmas time at the office leads to depression for Michael, when his girlfriend Carol (Nancy Walls) breaks up with him. Michael, Andy, Dwight, and Jim then go to a local Benihana restaurant, where Michael and Andy find dates with two of the restaurant's waitresses. Back at the office, after a conflict with a bossy Angela, Karen and Pam decide to create their own Christmas party. When the majority of the office decide to go to Karen and Pam's party, Angela becomes upset, and seeing this, Karen and Pam decide to combine the parties. Soon after, Michael and Andy's dates leave them, but Michael nevertheless finds someone to go to Jamaica with him. ==Plot== Carol Stills (Nancy Carell) confronts Michael Scott (Steve Carell) about the Christmas card he sent her, in which he superimposed his head on the body of Carol's former husband in a family photo. She breaks off the relationship, leaving Michael heartbroken and stuck with a pair of tickets to Jamaica. For the past several months, Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer) has led Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) to believe that he is being recruited by the CIA, and her gift to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) is that he can choose Dwight's first assignment. Jim declines the gift and claims that as the new office "Number Two" he should not be engaging in such activities, leaving Pam discouraged by a changed Jim. Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) takes Michael to Benihana to help him forget his recent troubles; Michael drags Dwight and Jim along. The group stumbles upon an unexpecting couple (Anne Sertich and Stephen Saux) at the table and Dwight fails when attempting to impress the chef with his knowledge of Japanese knives. Andy successfully isolates Dwight from the rest of the party and convinces Michael to ask out their waitress, Cindy (Brittany Ishibashi). Meanwhile, Jim plays pranks on Dwight and realizes that his excuse for declining Pam's gift does not hold water. Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey) kicks Karen Filippelli (Rashida Jones) off the Party Planning Committee. In response, Pam reaches out to Karen, and the two plan a rival party. Jim appears uncomfortable with Pam and Karen's new friendship. Roy comes into the break room and chats with Pam. After he leaves, Karen suggests that Pam should date Roy. Pam pauses to tell Karen her history with Roy before instead replying with "maybe". The rival Christmas parties begin, and the office staff members are forced to choose sides. Pam and Karen's party is a hit, while Angela's is a dreary affair. Michael and Andy each return with a waitress as their "new girlfriend" (though neither is the one who waited on them at the restaurant). Angela accepts Pam's offer to merge the parties. Oscar enters the office with his partner Gil just as Angela is singing "The Little Drummer Boy," pauses for a moment, says, "Too soon" and leaves. Meanwhile, Michael is unable to tell the two waitresses apart. To remedy this, he secretly marks his date's arm with a Sharpie. When he offers to take her to Jamaica, she declines and says that she has to attend school, and the two waitresses leave the party because it "blows". Jim consoles Michael by explaining that he just had a "rebound" relationship. Jim mentions that they are fun for a while, but then you keep on thinking about the girl that broke your heart, implying he still thinks about Pam (the girl who "broke his heart"). From his office, Michael makes a phone call and asks an unknown person to go to Jamaica with him. The offer is accepted. Pam is crushed when she sees Jim and Karen exchange gifts. Jim is crushed when he sees Roy give a gift to Pam. At the end of the day, Jim tells Pam that a helicopter will be arriving to take Dwight to a welcoming party at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia. As Dwight waits on the roof, he receives the text message: "You have been compromised. Abort mission. Destroy phone." Dwight throws his phone off the roof and walks away. == Production == "A Benihana Christmas" was written by Jennifer Celotta and directed by Harold Ramis. Ramis would return to direct the third-season episodes "Safety Training" and "Beach Games", as well as the sixth-season episode "The Delivery" (Pt. II). The episode was shot in a real Benihana restaurant in Encino, California. The production crew hired all of the restaurant's chefs and waitstaff, along with 78 background actors, to play in the episode. During filming, John Krasinski threw a shrimp across the table at Rainn Wilson. It bounced off Dwight's glasses and landed in the glass of water from which he was about to drink; according to actor Ed Helms, "It was a one-in-a-million shot that pretty much shut down the set for five or 10 minutes of applause." Ultimately, however, Ramis decided not to use the footage because it looked so improbable as to be unbelievable. The actresses who played the women that Andy and Michael bring back to the office were different from the actresses who played the waitresses in the Benihana restaurant. According to the show's prop master, this was because Andy and Michael failed to pick up the original waitresses, and settled for "less attractive ones". However, at Paley Fest 2007, Greg Daniels admitted that the women they cast were "too good-looking", which led to the joke failing since the original script specifically called for Andy and Michael's dates to be unattractive. == Reception == "A Benihana Christmas" was first broadcast on December 14, 2006, in the United States. According to estimates by Nielsen Media Research the episode was watched by an estimated 8.44 million viewers. The episode earned a 3.9/11 ratings share among adults aged 18 to 49, meaning that it was seen by 3.9 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds, and 11 percent of all 18- to 49-year-olds watching television at the time of broadcast. Among that demographic, The Office finished in twenty-first place for the week among all of the major networks. On the day that the episode first aired, it was the second most watched show of the night, behind only CBS's Survivor: Cook Islands. "A Benihana Christmas" was generally well received by critics. The episode was also given a 9.2 out of 10 rating by IGN. An IGN review stated: Years after the episode originally aired, the storyline involving the Benihana waitresses received renewed scrutiny in the wake of acknowledgement of racism against Asian Americans. Kat Ahn, the actress who played the waitress that Michael brought back to the office, said in an interview with The Washington Post that she was disenchanted upon realizing she had been cast on the show "just… to be the joke". Ahn also posted a video on TikTok, which she explained "The storyline with myself and the other Asian American actress is that we were the uglier versions of the actresses at the Benihana. Also that all Asian people look alike. We're one big monolith and just one big walking stereotype without any personality or any individuality, which is problematic. The whole joke was that all Asians look alike and that's why Michael Scott couldn't tell us apart." In a 2020 episode of the Office Ladies podcast, Jenna Fischer and Angela Kinsey noted that they cringed when re-watching the episode in 2020, and reflected that "the storyline would [not] have been written today." ==References== ==External links== *"A Benihana Christmas" at NBC.com * Category:American Christmas television episodes Category:The Office (American season 3) episodes Category:2006 American television episodes Category:The Office (American TV series) episodes in multiple parts

2983489	A Berlin Republic	A Berlin Republic () is a 1997 book composed of a collection of transcripts of interviews with the German philosopher and social critic Jürgen Habermas conducted by various European media in the mid-1990s. The common thread of the interviews is Habermas's disagreement with resurgent German nationalism after the reunification with the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Habermas's theoretical works are in the background of the interviews. At the time of the interviews, in the early 1990s, Habermas was publishing Between Facts and Norms, his philosophy of law and politics, and writing the political- philosophical essays which would later be collected in the volumes published in English as Justification and Application and The Inclusion of the Other. In A Berlin Republic, Habermas wages an intellectual campaign in Germany's political public sphere against what he sees as the backward-looking influence of German political theorist and proponent of Nazism, Carl Schmitt, and the philosopher Martin Heidegger. Schmitt advocated a "normalizing" view of German history, whereby Communism and Nazism would be equated, and the continuity of a reunified Germany with her pre-1945 past would be affirmed. Habermas encourages Germans to think differently about 1945 and 1989. In Habermas's view, Germany must reject any thought of basing her reunified future on a continuation of notions such as German ethnic identity as a foundation for the German state, Germany as a potential political and military power in central Europe, an "eastern-oriented" foreign policy, and the notion of a "special path" (Sonderweg) for Germany separate from that of other Western democracies. The rationale Habermas gives is initially historical—if Germans face squarely their past, they cannot wish for any continuity with it that does not own it as tragic and catastrophic. This harks back to his earliest writings of the 1950s, collected in Philosophical-Political Profiles, in which he sees the only way forward for a German philosophy is to remember the German-Jewish philosophy that was obliterated in the Holocaust. Beyond this, however, are two considerations that for Habermas loom larger. The first concerns the process of globalization, in all its forms: worldwide communications, transnational corporations, systemic impacts of human activity on the natural environment, unprecedented immigration, dramatic improvements in transportation and communication technologies, and international organizations. Habermas agrees with British theoretical sociologist Anthony Giddens that globalization transforms the nature of politics and community. Although the nation-state was, in the 18th and 19th centuries an appropriate location and scale for the development of an emancipated political public sphere, by the aftermath of World War II this was no longer the case. As problems are global their solutions be as well. Therefore, only a global scale of decision-making is appropriate, and the foreign affairs of nations must all be seen as the domestic affairs of the global community. Based on his theoretical notion of societal legitimacy coming only from the active, ongoing consent of the people, Habermas shows how his notion of a political public sphere provides, by means of the deliberative agreements developed in radical liberal democracy, a way for people who formerly considered themselves strangers can come to see themselves as having a common self-interest at a larger social scale than they had previously imagined. The second larger consideration for Habermas is the supplanting of what he calls "constitutional patriotism" for ethnic nationalism as the substantial glue holding a diverse, pluralistic society together. In a "postmetaphysical" age, worldview pluralism means that people cannot base agreements at a political level on particular religious values. Similarly, in an age of immigration and retreating racism, it is no longer appropriate to build political consensus in the state primarily upon one culture's values over another's. Consequently, the only way forward is to expand the emancipatory potential already present even in culturally- or religiously-grounded democratic institutions—namely, that people come by practice to see that their own interests are best safeguarded in procedural systems of law and politics that systematically protect the interests of all equally. A dedication to such a political-legal system is what Habermas means by "constitutional patriotism," as elaborated particularly in the essays later published as The Postnational Constellation. ==References== * Eriksen, Erik Oddvar.

31322688	A Berlin Romance	A Berlin Romance () is a 1956 East German neo-realist romantic drama film about youth urban life in the divided city of Berlin, directed by Gerhard Klein. It was produced by the DEFA film company. It stars Annekathrin Bürger, Ulrich Thein and Uwe-Jens Pape. The script was written by Wolfgang Kohlhaase with a score composed by Günter Klück. The film was the second collaboration between Klein and Kohlhaase; the first was Alarm in the Circus (Alarm im Zirkus), released in 1954 and third came in 1957 with Berlin - Ecke Schönhauser. These films were noted for their strong criticism of consumer culture in Berlin after World War II and the Americanization of the capital and are amongst DEFA's best known films. ==Plot== The film is a love story about a seventeen-year-old East German saleswoman named Uschi (Bürger) and an unemployed auto mechanic named Hans (Thein) from West Berlin. She leaves her familial home and moves into West Berlin, drawn by the brightness of the high streets and the economic progress in the West German side of the city. She initially dates Lord (Uwe-Jens Pape), a wealthy, leather-jacket-wearing ladies man, highly conscious of his own self-image and style. He is strongly influenced by American movie heartthrobs of the times. Meanwhile, she meets Hans, an auto mechanic who, also image-conscious and aspiring to be trendy, is living in relative poverty and is considered less physically attractive than Lord. Although initially mesmerized by the glamour of West Berlin and Lord, she falls in love with Hans, deciding that looks and image are not important. She eventually returns home to her parents along with Hans, who finds a job in the Eastern side of the city. ==Cast== *Annekathrin Bürger as Ushi *Ulrich Thein as Hans *Uwe-Jens Pape as Lord *Erika Dunkelmann as Ushi's mother *Marga Legal as Hans' mother *Erich Franz as Ushi's father *Horst Kube as Max *Hartmut Reck as Harald *Hermann Wagemann as shoe shiner *Eckard Friedrichson as Moses *Helga Wachaletz as Karin *Paul Pfingst as teacher *Karl Weber as construction entrepreneur *Günter Großsteinbeck as Heini *Karl Kendzia as worker of the Commerce Organization ==Production== Cinematographer Wolf Göthe was conscious of making the film as convincing as possible, and in shooting the film he used techniques such as wide-angle lenses, extensive location work and high-speed film to create a sense of realism. ===Themes=== The film, inspired by Italian neo-realism, is a poignant insight into the difference in socio-economic customs and general domestic life which divided the city of Berlin during this period. Through the protagonist, Uschi, the audience is able to understand the feelings and emotions felt by many at the time. thumb|right|300px|The film is a strong critique of the consumerist and image obsessions of the Berlin youth, influenced by American culture in the aftermath of World War II. Pictured are Uschi and Lord, with hairstyles and clothing evoking the Golden Age of Hollywood The film is one of the strongest critiques of consumer culture in Germany in the 1950s in the aftermath of World War II.Alexander Stephan, in his book, Americanization and Anti- Americanism. The German Encounter with American Culture After 1945, argues that connection between bourgeois and individualism and the ethos of socialism became increasingly politicized after the Second World War. He claims consumerist fantasies between the west and the eastern sectors of Berlin increased as the city being masculinized as a direct result of the American influence in the capital and the legacy of Hollywood film rebels, such as James Dean. He argues that the film, rather that being an advert for West Berlin, is in fact a critique of Americanization in the western side of the capital, and that American masculine influences weakened traditional senses of authority in both public and domestic life, and says, "In typical neo-realist fashion, Klein and Kohlhaase evoke the Americanization of East Berlin through their relationship to modern mass culture." The film, in this context, can therefore be seen as the struggle of young, working-class West German men in the city in a changing society with new pressures and influences brought about by the Americanization of the capital. Uschi's stern parents represent the traditional values which conflicted with the emerging youth culture in the city. One of the most important pieces of consumer iconography in the film is the Kofferradio, a transistor radio, which Lord wears around his neck and which Uschi professes to love. It is a metaphor for the economic discrepancy which existed at the time between East and West Berlin and how the East lagged behind the West. ==Reception== The film received a mixed reception upon release in May 1956. Due to the tendencies of the film to seemingly view West Germany from an ideological viewpoint, the film was criticized by the Ministry of Film in East Germany and was said to directly provide a negative instruction to young people in the east to move to the west where life is depicted as superior. Despite this, Klein and Kohlhaase collaborated again the following year with another realist film Schönhauser Corner (1957), which was a greater success at the box-office than A Berlin Romance. These two films are regarded as the most accurate insights into the East Berlin youth scene in the aftermath of World War II and were a considerable success amongst the public. The films have been described as "offering a more open engagement with American youth culture" and playing a "pivotal role in the rituals of protest shared by urban youth in East and West Berlin". The film was praised by newspapers such as BZ am Abend, Junge Welt and Berliner Zeitung for its accurate representation of urban culture in contemporary life in Berlin in the mid-fifties, that it showed people as they really were. However, some East German papers criticized the film for not providing an effective counter response to Uschi's notions that the East is bland and boring in comparison to the glamour of the west. Horst Knietzsch of Neus Deustchland believed that the "vital matters of the divided city" could have been dealt with much more effectively by Klein and Kohlhaase and by being more assertive in their depictions of the positive and negative aspects of the city at the time. He did offer some praise of Bürger's portrayal of Uschi, remarking that "She has a sweet, attractive face and a sexy figure (accentuated by tight dresses), but as an amateur she is only convincing as long as she plays herself." ==References== ==External links== * Category:1956 films Category:1956 romantic drama films Category:East German films Category:1950s German-language films Category:Films set in Berlin Category:German romantic drama films Category:1950s German films Category:German black-and-white films

58595904	A Better Chance	A Better Chance (ABC) is a non-profit organization with the goal of helping more talented young people of color to become well-educated by attending high- achieving boarding, day, and public schools in the United States. ABC was founded in 1963 and is headquartered in New York, New York, with regional offices around the United States. The organization works towards having a great number of young people of color assume roles of leadership in the United States. == History == A Better Chance was a development of the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students (NSSFNS). NSSFNS was an organization that referred black students to college and private boarding schools. In 1962, NSSFNS phased out referring students to private boarding school. However, the director of NSSFNS set up a meeting with 23 headmasters from the New England area to reestablish the program. They discussed the link between poverty and lack of education. Richard Plaut, Director of the National Scholarship and Service Fund for Negro Students, and John Kemper, Headmaster of Phillips Academy, came to the conclusion that broadening educational opportunities for minorities would lead to them living better lives. In 1964, fifty-five boys were given the chance to attend a prep school contingent on the plan they complete an intensive eight-week summer school program at Dartmouth College. This program was to be called A Better Chance (ABC) and from this its two basic components were derived. The first component is to identify students and refer them to member schools. The second component is a summer program to serve as a transition to boarding school. The program was run by the Independent Schools Talent Search Program (ISTSP) which separated from NSSFNS to become its own non-profit charitable trust in 1964. The first sources of administrative funding were dues from member schools and a grant awarded by the Merrill Trust. In 1972, ISTSP merged with Public School Programs to form A Better Chance, Inc. == Goal == Originally, A Better Chance wanted to integrate students of color into higher education in order for them to achieve better lives. At the time of its founding colleges had minority enrollments of less than one percent. Currently, A Better Chance states its goal is working towards having a greater number of young people of color assume roles of leadership in the United States. 43 of the 503 most powerful people in US in culture, government, business and more are people of color. In order to change that the organization wants to create a self-sustaining pipeline of diverse leaders. Additionally, the organization would like to close the gap in academic achievement based on race and allow students of color to realize their full potential. The organization carries out its goal by annually recruiting, referring and supporting 500 scholars at more than 300 member schools in 29 states. It has reported more than 16,000 alumni who have gone into careers as physicians, artists, educators, lawyers, politicians, and corporate executives. The number of A Better Chance alumni attending college after high school is more than 96% compared to 24% of students of color nationwide. == Admission == In order to apply to ABC, the student must be a citizen or permanent resident of United States, identify as a person of color, and be in grades 4-9.

15428392	A Better Class of Person	A Better Class of Person (1981) is an autobiography written by dramatist John Osborne and published in 1981. Based on Osborne's childhood and early life, it ends with the first performance of Look Back in Anger at the Royal Court Theatre in 1956. The book emphasises his warm relationship with his father Thomas, and his antagonistic relationship with his mother Nellie Beatrice, which deepened to hatred after his father died when John was young. A sequel, Almost a Gentleman, was published in 1991. ==Composition== After Watch It Come Down (1976), the latest of several plays of his to have a hostile reception, Osborne had no new work performed in the theatre for sixteen years.. In the late 1970s, he had also been through an acrimonious divorce from his fourth wife, actress Jill Bennett. During this period his fifth wife, Helen Dawson, encouraged him to write an autobiography. A restraining order required Osborne to submit any autobiography to Bennett for her approval; the only explicit mention of her is Osborne's brief description of seeing her photograph displayed outside a London theatre as an adolescent.. ==Synopsis== Osborne spends his early childhood in the then working-class Fulham area of London, among his barmaid mother’s family. Like his tubercular father, a copywriter, Osborne has to spend a lot of time in hospitals and sanatoria. He represents his mother as heartless, judgmental and passive-aggressive. In 1936, his parents move to Stoneleigh, a suburb in Surrey. Osborne falls in love with a Stoneleigh girl from a privileged background who "could be spitefully snobbish, correcting my pronunciation of words".. He is lonely at the private school his father's benevolent society has paid for him to attend, but ultimately makes friends with an eccentric boy called Mickey Wall, a civil servant's son whose contempt for authority and subversive sense of humour Osborne enjoys. Osborne and Wall take to calling themselves "the Viper Gang". As they get older, the pair enjoy arguing about politics, literature and religion. Meanwhile, Thomas’s health deteriorates. At the outbreak of WW2, the Osbornes move to the Isle of Wight, for safety and in the hope that he can convalesce. Thomas dies, and Osborne begins to hate his mother because of what he sees as her uncaring response. The death leaves Osborne and his mother destitute, but Thomas's society decides Osborne should go to a boarding school in Dorset. He gets in trouble at this school for falling in love with the headmaster's niece and is ultimately expelled. Now a young adult and living with his mother, Osborne finds employment in trade journalism and gets to know an ebullient Canadian editor called Arnold Running who has literary aspirations and encourages Osborne's. Through getting involved in amateur dramatics, he meets a girl called Renee whose parents are eager for them to be engaged, though Osborne begins to get cold feet about marriage. Keen to get away from both the women in his life, Osborne enlists Arnold to persuade Nellie Beatrice that he should move into acting professionally; he secures a job with a touring repertory company and breaks off his engagement with Renee by post. An older actress called Stella Linden joins the cast and Osborne is smitten by her. She offers him help with his writing, and eventually they become lovers. After the tour ends, he spends a period in Brighton as a kept man, working on a play with Stella, but Osborne finds her insistence on conventional subject-matter and playwriting technique constricting, and the pair drift apart. She gets a job in Kendal and Osborne has to leave the flat they have lived in rent-free. Unwilling to live with Nellie Beatrice, he joins an acting troupe in Ilfracombe and gets to know an actor called Anthony Creighton whose unrequited crush on him Osborne tolerates. The company does several provincial tours before disbanding. While acting in Somerset, Osborne falls in love with a local actress, and they marry despite her prosperous parents' disapproval of him. At first the young couple are happy, but work drives them apart as her career thrives while his does not. He moves in with Creighton and they collaborate on several unsuccessful plays. Creighton's mother dies, leaving a small inheritance, and Osborne persuades him to buy a river barge where they can live cheaply. He writes Look Back in Anger, based on his troubled marriage, and submits it to various agents. He is living on the Thames with Creighton when George Devine, artistic director of the English Stage Company, accepts the play and rows out to the houseboat to meet him. At both the book's opening and its close, Osborne mentions that the premiere of Look Back in Anger in 1956 took place on his beloved father’s birthday, the 8th of May.. Throughout the autobiography, he presents passages from his works in parallel with real-life events that inspired them: as playwright Alan Bennett says in an early review, through this technique Osborne is open about having used his life as literary material. ==Reception== Alan Bennett, assessing the work for the London Review of Books in 1981, suggested that the depiction of Osborne's mother was not entirely fair, but was positive in his appraisal overall and noted how many other critics had been as well: "It is immensely enjoyable, is written with great gusto and Osborne has had better notices for it than for any of his plays since Inadmissible Evidence." Bennett's words echo those of John Lahr in The New York Times: "the best piece of writing Osborne has done since Inadmissible Evidence... A Better Class of Person takes its energy from looking backward to the source of his pain before fame softened him. In this first installment of his autobiography, Osborne rediscovers the daring and cheek which distinguished his early, good work." Reviewing its sequel, Hilary Mantel wrote, "A Better Class of Person is written with the tautness and power of a well-organised novel. It is... remarkable for its account of the lower-middle-class childhood on the fringes of London, and for its vengeful portrait of a mother who had 'eyes that missed nothing and understood nothing'." Several commentators have stated that Osborne's reputation is likely to rest on his two autobiographies no less than his plays. Both Bennett and Osborne's biographer Michael Ratcliffe make a comparison with Charles Dickens: "Osborne... seems to have had a childhood of Dickensian richness and oddity"; "Attempting matricide [in his portrayal of Nellie Beatrice], Osborne instead made a creature of whom Dickens would have been proud." The theatre historian Phyllis Hartnoll was cool in her appraisal of Osborne's plays and their influence, but in the 1993 edition of her reference work The Oxford Companion to the Theatre she added A Better Class of Person to a list of recommended reading; its later chapters provide a vivid picture of 1940s and 1950s provincial repertory theatre.. As Osborne announces in the book, Nellie Beatrice was still alive when it was published ("My grandmother lived to be 103 and my own mother seems appropriately hell bent on a similar score"), but it is unknown whether she read it: by this time the two had long since stopped speaking... ==Accuracy== As well as raising the issue of how fair the book is to Nellie Beatrice (and later commentators such as Blake Morrison would conclude that it is unfair), Bennett notes how vague the author often is with dates (including his own birthdate) and comments, "Osborne... had a bleak childhood (or would like us to think so)." One of Osborne's statements, that he was expelled from school for hitting the headmaster, was later contradicted by a fellow pupil.. In places the book contradicts itself: for example, Osborne claims that the reason for his Great Uncle Frank's shameful and sudden emigration to Canada was never spoken of within the family, then in the next chapter says that this was known to be embezzlement.. Osborne refers somewhat dismissively to the gay Creighton's attraction to him: "he was one of those luckless homosexuals, like J.R. Ackerley, who only fall in love with heterosexuals. I was quite fond of him, but his frequent references to 'the rough kiss of male Hamlets' made me eager for him to find some young actor who would command his whole attention".. After Osborne's death, Creighton produced letters from him that suggested their relationship had been more intimate, though Osborne's family contested this. ==Dramatic version== The autobiography was preceded by a screenplay entitled Too Young to Fight, Too Old to Forget, which was broadcast by Thames TV on 13 July 1985 under the title A Better Class of Person. It was directed by Frank Cvitanovich, with Eileen Atkins and Alan Howard as Osborne's parents and Gary Capelin and Neil McPherson as Osborne.. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:1985 films Category:1985 drama films Category:British drama films Category:Literary autobiographies Category:1980s English-language films Category:1980s British films

34556627	A Better Human Being	"A Better Human Being" is the thirteenth episode of the fourth season of the Fox science-fiction drama television series Fringe, and the series' 78th episode overall. The episode was co-written by Robert Chiappetta, Alison Schapker, Monica Owusu-Breen, and Glen Whitman. Joe Chappelle directed the episode. ==Plot== When Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson) realizes that Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) is experiencing memories from the Olivia of his original timeline, he convinces her to allow his father Walter (John Noble) to examine her. They find nothing immediately wrong with her brain, but Walter takes some hair samples for testing. With Olivia out of earshot, Walter scolds Peter in the belief that Peter is—perhaps unintentionally—empathizing his memories onto Olivia, who as a child was highly emotionally attuned to others. The Fringe division learns of a case of a teenager, Sean Martin (Harrison Thomas), in a mental institution who, while in a nighttime trance, reportedly related in perfect detail the distant murder of a reporter by three teenagers. Sean explains that he hears voices from "outside" his head, leading Walter to believe that some type of telepathy is involved. Sean's transcription of the voices he heard during the murder leads the team to a subway bathroom, where they discover blood from an assailant injured in the attack. Astrid (Jasika Nicole) stays with the boy as he is purposely taken off his medications, hoping to identify the voices that he hears. Analysis of the assailant's blood does not produce an identity, but Walter realizes that the sample shares a similar genetic anomaly with Sean's DNA, a trait that can only be shared by common ancestry. Olivia and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) learn from Sean's mother that Sean was conceived by in vitro fertilisation, and that the deceased reporter had called her a few days before, looking into the process. Walter concludes that Sean is reading the thoughts of other in vitro children that share the same genetic trait and are protecting themselves like animals in a hive. The team locates the doctor that performed the process, Dr. Owen Frank (John Aylward). Dr. Frank admits that he modified and donated samples of his own DNA to re-introduce instinctive traits into humans, attempting to build "a better human being". Walter recognizes that the children who share this trait are likely killing to prevent their genetically modified nature from becoming public. Dr. Frank provides Olivia and Peter with the location of his files, unaware that several of his progeny have already arrived there and are lying in wait. As Olivia and Peter discover the destroyed files, Olivia mentions information from the original timeline that Peter was not privy to, which means he can't be projecting his own memories on to her. Meanwhile, Sean hears voices plotting to ambush the duo, and Astrid is able to alert Olivia in time for her and Peter to defend themselves and capture their attackers. However, a second pair of teenagers suffocates Dr. Frank. With the doctor dead, Sean is no longer able to hear any voices, a situation he both welcomes and fears. Walter discovers from Olivia's hair samples that she has recently been given doses of Cortexiphan. He and Lincoln confront Nina Sharp (Blair Brown) and demand an inspection of Walter and William Bell's Cortexiphan samples, which were stored in Massive Dynamic's headquarters under biometric security measures. Nina shows them the vials, but Walter recognizes that the Cortexiphan inside has been replaced with food coloring, implicating Nina. After completing the case, Olivia and Peter stop at a gas station on their way home. Olivia discusses the lifestyle they had in Peter's timeline and he confesses that he can tell from her eyes that Olivia is the same as from his original timeline. After a brief kiss, Olivia leaves the car to use the restroom, but Peter discovers that she has disappeared. Elsewhere, Olivia regains consciousness tied up in a tiled room, along with a fatigued Nina tied to a chair opposite her, telling her that everything is all right. ==Production== The teleplay for this episode was co-written by co-executive producers Monica Owusu-Breen and Alison Schapker, based on a story by executive story editors Glen Whitman and Robert Chiappetta. It was directed by executive producer Joe Chappelle. Actress Blair Brown was unaware of the surprise surrounding her character Nina Sharp, whom she had played for a number of fourth season episodes, until she received the episode's script. She noted that it was a "great thrill" to read the script, and added "The way we work is the writers always have something in mind, and it’s always more fun to just wait and see what shows up." ==Cultural references== In the lab, when Dr. Walter Bishop is testing Olivia Dunham's DNA, the song being played in the background is Karen Elson's "The Ghost Who Walks" from the album of the same name. The instance of a fertility doctor using his own sperm to impregnate several of his patients is highly reminiscent of the case of Dr. Cecil Jacobson, who was accused of such practices and later convicted of perjury and had his medical license revoked. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== "A Better Human Being" was first broadcast on February 17, 2012, in the United States on Fox. An estimated 3 million viewers watched the episode, marking a slight decrease in viewers from the previous episode. ===Reviews=== Entertainment Weekly columnist Jeff Jensen called the episode "a significant, clever, and on the whole compelling hour of season 4 Fringe." He did complain however that "as the episode progressed, I felt the case-of-the-week was no longer complementing the Olivia storyline but distracting from it. More, it just didn’t seem plausible that Olivia would continue/would be permitted to continue working after being diagnosed with what a psychologist would call 'a psychotic episode.'... Yet again: I was entertained and engaged. I thought Allegedly Crazy Sean was a clever twist on the magical nutjob archetype, and I was intellectually and emotionally activated by Olivia’s life changing internal event, which begged various meaningful questions about the nature of identity and whatnot. And I thought the performances by Anna Torv and Joshua Jackson were just great. After a slow, slightly frustrating install, Fringe 4.0's reboot-oriented operating system is beginning to yield stories that are stimulating for being unique products of that premise." ==References== ==External links== * "A Better Human Being" at Fox.com * Category:2012 American television episodes Category:Fringe (season 4) episodes

The first time she saw him, two years after she left him, Khan was weak and speechless. But as they continued to meet by chance over a six-year period, and her life continued to improve, they'd exchange a few minutes of small talk. It was during such chance encounter in 2011 that Steve asked if they could sit down. Once seated, Steve repeatedly apologized before bursting into tears. In the ensuing years, Khan wondered if talking to Steve more might help her deal with her trauma, and help Steve to better understand the roots and consequences of his violence and make him less likely to reoffend. She also decided to try to record such a dialogue as a resource for both domestic abuse survivors and offenders. She proposed such an idea to Steve in 2013. Six months later, he texted her that he was ready to meet. Two days later, they did so at a coffee shop for their first recorded exchange. Khan and her ex-abuser would go on film eight days together over the course of a year, sharing their memories and experiences and with Steve facing the consequences of what he did. == Production == A Better Man was co-produced by Intervention Productions (prod. Christine Kleckner) and the National Film Board of Canada (prod. Justine Pimlott), and executive produced by Sarah Polley, Anita Lee, Jane Jankovic, Janice Dawe, and Kathy Aurich-Johnson. The music was composed by Lesley Barber. Iris Ng was the film's cinematographer, having previously worked with Polley on Stories We Tell. A Better Man was co-written and co-directed by Attiya Khan. Attiya Khan is a Canadian filmmaker, anti-violence activist, and intimate partner violence survivor. She graduated with a degree in women's studies and psychology from the University of Toronto. Her interest in helping others who have experienced domestic violence led her to take the Assaulted Women's and Children's Counsellor/Advocate program at George Brown College. Her career highlights include overseeing the Children and Youth Services Program at Transition House in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and wide-ranging roles including frontline work, management and training with YWCA Toronto. She is based in Toronto. === Crowdfunding === The film was crowd-sourced through an Indiegogo campaign, with Feist among the donors, contributing $10,000. The campaign would go on to raise over $110,000—one of the most successful crowdfunding campaigns in Canadian history. == Release == The film screened at numerous film festivals and had its world premiere at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival, where it was considered "one of Hot Docs most stirring films."Digital Journal Today A Better Man continues to play at international film festivals and violence against women events. The film also plays on occasion at Hot Docs in Toronto, Ontario. == Distribution == A Better Man is distributed in the United States by Women Make Movies. === Reception === Since its release, the film has received mostly positive reviews from critics; Kate Taylor of The Globe and Mail listed the film in her top 10 list of films for 2017. The New Yorker film reviewer Doreen St. Félix commended the film's "cleverness" and wrote that "it resists the roundness of resolution or catharsis". Arwa Mahdawi of The Guardian described the film as "a call to action for abusive men to stand up and take responsibility for their anger and their actions."The Guardian CBC host of The Current Anna Maria Tremonti stated that "there is a lot of raw emotion in this film and there is a lot hope."The Current Maclean's reported that "the film manages to be simultaneously agonizing and hopeful… it is revelatory to know these kinds of [restorative] conversations are possible."MacLean's Miriam Bale of Vulture.com called the film a "revolutionary documentary." The Hollywood Reporter published a less enthusiastic review, concluding that "the vagueness and ambiguity of the situations eventually proves frustrating and detract from the film's power." National Film Board of Canada made a review saying "A Better Man offers a fresh and nuanced look at the healing and revelation that can happen for everyone involved when men take responsibility for their abuse", commenting on the films use of healing process in domestic violence situations. == See also == *Restorative justice *Domestic violence *Domestic Violence Documentaries *Sexual Violence *Thordis Elva - book of rape and responsibility. ==References== ==External links== * *http://www.wmm.com/filmcatalog/pages/c959.shtml * * *A Better Man at The Hollywood Reporter Category:Canadian independent films Category:Canadian documentary films Category:Films about domestic violence Category:2017 films Category:Documentary films about violence against women Category:Films shot in Ottawa Category:National Film Board of Canada documentaries Category:Films scored by Lesley Barber Category:Documentary films about reconciliation Category:Indiegogo projects Category:Crowdfunded films Category:2017 documentary films Category:Violence against women in Canada Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s Canadian films

3689613	A Better Place	A Better Place is a 1997 drama film written and directed by Vincent Pereira. It stars Robert DiPatri and Eion Bailey. It was produced in association with View Askew, Kevin Smith's production company, and released to DVD by Synapse Films. It was nominated for the Golden Starfish Award for Best American Independent Film at the 1997 Hamptons International Film Festival. In 2016, the film screened out of jury competition, in the director-curated block, but was chosen as the Audience Favorite Feature Film of the first annual Oil Valley Film Festival. ==Plot== Barret Michaelson is an unwelcome newcomer in a public high school, often bullied by his new classmates. He has no friends until another misfit with a bad reputation, Ryan, saves him from a beating in the men's locker room. Ryan is a misanthropic existentialist with violent tendencies and a dark past. It is revealed that Ryan's father murdered his mother and then committed suicide in front of Ryan when he was only ten years old. The two become fast friends who spend much of their time together engaged in philosophical conversation, but their friendship comes to an abrupt halt when the two are involved in an incident with a local landowner who claims they are trespassing on his land. Ryan throws a rock at the man, causing him to fall and break his neck on a rock. The two manage to successfully make it look like an accident, but the incident forces Barret to pull away from his friendship with Ryan. This causes Ryan to become very emotional, and to purchase a black market gun. Barret soon agrees that they should put the incident behind them and continue to be friends, but Ryan becomes increasingly morose and attached to Barret. When Ryan suffers a brutal beating at the hands of the bully against whom Ryan had originally defended Barret, he is consumed by a will for revenge, and makes it clear to Barret that he intends to shoot the bully to death. Barret tries as hard as he can to dissuade Ryan, but Ryan says it's his "destiny" and insists that there is nothing Barret can do to stop him. As the moment of truth approaches, Ryan forces Barret at gun point to accompany him to the would-be crime scene. Ryan finds his enemy in a secluded area, smoking what is probably a joint (marijuana cigarette). Barret tries to warn him, but it is to no avail, and Ryan kills him. After the killing, Barret tries to incapacitate Ryan by hitting on the head with a rock, but it doesn't work. In a struggle, the gun goes off, claiming Ryan's life. Barret then shoots him once again, and tries to turn the gun on himself, but by that time the gun is out of bullets. ==Cast== * Eion Bailey as Ryan * Robert DiPatri as Barret Michaelson * Joseph Cassese as Todd * Carmen Llywelyn as Augustine * Brian Lynch as Eddie * Bryan Sproat as Justin * Molly Castelloe as Meg * Jason Lee as Dennis Pepper * Vincent Pereira as Jake * Richard Lynch as Mr. Raimi * Scott Mosier as Larry * Stan Dunbar as Large rude student ==Themes== Themes include misanthropy, introversion, teen violence, suicide, fatalism, and existentialism. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1997 films Category:1990s coming-of-age drama films Category:American coming-of-age drama films Category:1997 independent films Category:Films set in New Jersey Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:American independent films Category:View Askew Productions films Category:1997 drama films Category:1990s English-language films Category:1990s American films
13558949	A Better Place to Be	"A Better Place to Be" is a song by Harry Chapin from his 1972 album, Sniper and Other Love Songs. The song is about a midnight watchman confiding in a waitress, while drinking gin, about a woman that he met a week before and had a one-night stand with. Released as a single, the song reached No. 18 on the Billboard Bubbling Under chart. A live version, from the 1976 album Greatest Stories Live, reached No. 86 on the Hot 100 chart. Record World called it a "distinctive Chapin narrative, this time a downbeat tale about two lonely people." According to Chapin, it was his favorite song that he wrote. ==Story== The song begins with "a little man" sitting at a bar, looking glum. The waitress, who is described as a "big ol' friendly girl", notices this in him and asks him what his problem is. The little man ignores the waitress at first, but after "a couple of sips" of gin, he begins to tell her his story. The song then takes the little man's point of view as he states that he is a midnight watchman at a place called Miller's Tool & Die. One week earlier, he goes to a diner and sees a beautiful girl. Though worried that she's too good for him, the little man still attempts to "give her one good try." Stammering, he makes a fool of himself, but the girl takes his offer, saying in the song's refrain: : If you want me to come with you : then that's all right with me : Because I've been goin' nowhere : And anywhere's a better place to be The little man takes her home and attempts to turn on the lights as he enters his room, but the girl tells him to leave the lights off because she "doesn't mind the dark". The little man cannot believe his good luck, and tries again to speak to the girl, who says only: : If you want to come here with me : then that's all right with me : because I've been oh so lonely : Loving someone is a better way to be. The next day, the little man watches her sleep and leaves early so he can return and surprise her with breakfast. When he returns, he finds she has gone, leaving behind a "six word letter, saying 'It's time that I moved on.'" After the little man's story, the tearful waitress tells him she wishes that she too were beautiful so she could go home with the little man. He responds to the waitress a "crooked grin", finishes his drink, and acknowledges their shared loneliness by repeating the song's first refrain. He says if she wants him to go home with her "that's alright with [him]" implying he will go home with her. Although Harry often wrote songs about his own life experiences, it is not known if the "early morning bar room" or factory in Watertown actually existed or does today. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1972–73) Peak position U.S. Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles 118 Canadian Adult Contemporary 51 ==Live Version== The song was released as a single on the live album, Greatest Stories Live. While introducing the song, Chapin states he came up with the song while visiting Watertown, New York, claiming he "spent a week there one afternoon". The live version was, until 2015 (when David Bowie's Blackstar took the title), the longest song to chart on the Billboard Hot 100. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1976) Peak position U.S. Billboard Hot 100 86 CanadaRPM Top Singles 80 ===Year-end Charts=== Chart (1976) Peak position U.S. Billboard Hot 100 456 == External links== * A Better Place to Be Lyrics ==References== Category:1972 songs Category:Harry Chapin songs Category:Songs written by Harry Chapin

65242707	A Better Time	A Better Time is the third studio album by Nigerian singer Davido. It was released on November 13, 2020, through Davido Music Worldwide (DMW), RCA Records and Sony Music. The album features guest appearances from Nicki Minaj, Nas, Young Thug, Mayorkun, Chris Brown, Tiwa Savage, Mugeez, CKay, Lil Baby, Hit-Boy, Sho Madjozi, Bella Shmurda and Sauti Sol. Its production was handled by Hit-Boy, Napji, Fresh VDM, Peruzzi and Speroach Beatz, among others. Davido had not planned to release an album in 2020, since he had announced a North American tour in support of his 2019 album, A Good Time and did not think he would have time to record, with the tour scheduled to begin in the winter and end in spring 2020. However, in March 2020 he had to cancel the sold-out 26-show tour due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result returned to the studio to record the tracks that became A Better Time. ==Background== Davido recorded A Better Time in Lagos, Nigeria, except for two songs ("Heaven" and Shopping Spree") which were recorded in Los Angeles. He told NME that "With the lockdown and me just being at home it gave me time to really work on the music rather than having to juggle it with being on the road. There was nothing to do. There were no shows. I was at home with my producers, just creating and creating all day." NME described the album as making "a convincing case that the problems of the world really might just melt away – even if only momentarily – though a sense of escapism and the enduring powers of art and pop music." He told Complex, "We (African people) always like to celebrate and A Better Time is that outlet to be free, be happy and hopeful for a better future." The album's cover art features Davido with his then-one- year-old son Ifeanyi Adeleke. ==Singles== The album's lead single "FEM" was released on September 11, 2020. It was produced by Napji. With lyrics in both English and Yoruba, the title translates from Yoruba roughly as "Shut up." It has been sung by #EndSARS protesters in Nigeria, protests which Davido himself traveled to Abuja to join. The video attracted a million views within nine hours of its release and three million in its first 24 hours, while the single reached No. 1 on Apple Music in at least eight countries, including Nigeria, where it held the top spot for four weeks. It also hit No. 8 on Billboard's World digital Song Sales chart. The album's second single "So Crazy" was released on November 9, 2020. It featured Lil Baby and was produced by Nick Papz and Xander. The music video was directed by David Wept and filmed in Los Angeles. The third single, "Jowo," was released on December 4, 2020, produced by Napji and Magicboi. The video, directed by Dammy Twitch and shot in Lagos, received more than 24 million views on YouTube in its first four months. The fourth single, "The Best," was produced by Mayorkun and Senzi and released on January 28, 2021. In the music video, filmed in Lagos and directed by Dammy Twitch, the two artists paid homage to Japanese culture. ==Critical reception== In one of the first reviews to appear, Kevin EG Perry of NME awarded A Better Time 4 stars out of 5, comparing the album to its predecessor A Good Time as follows: "While it remains to be seen whether it can capture the zeitgeist in the way that its predecessor did, this 17-track collection certainly matches up in terms of tunes." Perry added: "clearly his good vibes are contagious. That’s true of the whole record, which is heavy on steel drums, synths and horns and light on trouble." Tochi Imo of Clash Music wrote, "The feature-heavy project sees Davido match up with the likes of Nicki Minaj and Lil Baby on a tape filled with a mixture of both high and gentle energies throughout. Themes such as romance frequent the project and whilst Davido doesn’t stray too far from his lyrical comfort zone, we can enjoy an artist we know and love in his newest record." A mixed review by Wale Oloworekende at The Native stated: "Too many times on A Better Time, Davido’s hits-focused approach impedes the continuity of exciting concepts and sacrifices cohesion for dynamism, but the tradeoff is a body of work that doubles down on Davido’s worldview and presents a clear vision of how Nigerian pop can dovetail with American hip-hop at full blast." Tomiwa at Too Xclusive wrote that the album was "a show of growth and development, although there are quite some misses on this one, the fact that he didn’t change the status quo and still kept it fresh with a slew of incredible features that makes it spectacular." == Accolades == At the 6th ceremony of All Africa Music Awards, A Better Time received a nomination for Album of the Year. |- |2021 |A Better Time |Album of the Year | ==Track listing== Credits adapted from OkayAfrica and Spotify. ==Charts== Chart (2020) Peak position ==Release history== Region Date Format Label Various November 12, 2020 ==References== Category:2020 albums Category:Davido albums Category:Yoruba-language albums Category:Albums produced by Hit-Boy Category:Albums produced by Kiddominant Category:Albums produced by Blaisebeatz
89541	A Better Tomorrow	A Better Tomorrow () is a 1986 Hong Kong action film directed and co-written by John Woo, and starring Ti Lung, Leslie Cheung and Chow Yun-fat. The film had a profound influence on Hong Kong action cinema, and has been recognised as a landmark film credited with setting the template for the heroic bloodshed genre, with considerable influence on both the Hong Kong film industry and Hollywood. Produced with a tight budget and released with virtually no advertising, A Better Tomorrow broke Hong Kong's box office record and went on to become a blockbuster in Asia. The film is highly regarded, ranking #2 in the Best 100 Chinese Motion Pictures. Its success led to a sequel, A Better Tomorrow II, also directed by Woo, and A Better Tomorrow 3: Love & Death in Saigon, a prequel directed by Tsui Hark. It has been remade several times. The film was Chow Yun-fat's breakout role and launched him as one of the top superstars in the Hong Kong film industry. Chow's character "Mark Lee" has been imitated by many fans even decades after the film's release. Following this film, Chow went on to make several more notable films with Woo. ==Plot== Sung Tse-Ho is a senior member of a powerful Hong Kong triad, managing a lucrative printing and distributing operation that produces counterfeit American bank notes. Ho is a respected member of the organization, entrusted with the most important transactions. Mark Lee is his best friend, bodyguard, and business partner. The prologue follows a day in the life of Ho and Mark as they watch a fresh batch of counterfeit notes being printed and meet with foreign clients to trade their product for counterfeit Hong Kong dollar notes. Meanwhile, Ho's younger brother, Kit, has just graduated high school and is currently training to join the police. Ho hides his criminal life from his brother and encourages Kit's career choice, while their ailing father pleads for Ho to leave his life of crime. Ho agrees, deciding that he will retire from the triad after his next deal in Taiwan. Shing, a low-ranking triad member, joins Ho after he agrees to mentor him. However, they are ambushed by the Taiwanese triads, leading to a shootout in which Ho and Shing flee into a sewage tunnel entrance, pursued by local law enforcement. Ho tells Shing to run and surrenders to the police in order to buy time for him to escape, leading to a three-year prison sentence. After learning of the deal, the triads attempt to kidnap Ho's father as leverage to ensure Ho's silence in prison; Ho's father is fatally stabbed before Kit and his girlfriend Jackie manage to subdue the attacker. With his dying breath, he pleads Kit to forgive his brother for his criminal actions, and an enraged Kit blames Ho for their father's death. Later, Mark travels to Taiwan to get answers from the Taiwanese triad. He visits a restaurant where the gangster who planned the ambush is dining and kills him following a shootout with his bodyguards. However, Mark's leg is injured in the process, leaving him crippled and requiring a leg brace. After Ho is released from prison, he is approached by a corrupt policeman, who offers to take him back to triad headquarters so he can rejoin his old organization. Ho, determined to start a new life, declines the offer and instead begins working for a taxi company run by another ex-con named Ken. During one of his shifts, Ho encounters Mark, and he discovers that his old friend is now a bitter, broken shell of his former self after Shing stripped him of his position in the triad and cast him aside in his rise to power. When they reunite, Mark urges Ho to confront Shing, but Ho refuses. Ho then seeks out Kit, now a police officer, in hopes of reconciling. However, Ho is harshly rebuffed by Kit, who still blames Ho for their father's death and because his relation to Ho is preventing him from advancing his career. In an effort to prove himself and further distance himself from his brother, Kit becomes obsessed with bringing down Shing, despite Ho's warnings. Shing, hearing of Ho's return to Hong Kong, tries to persuade him to return and help expand their triad into drug trafficking, but Ho refuses. Shing then has his men attack the taxi company, severely beat Mark, and lure Kit into a trap that leaves him critically wounded. Though Ho is still hesitant to take action, Mark is eventually able to persuade Ho to retaliate. Mark steals a computer tape containing printing plate data from the counterfeiting business and they then discover that it was Shing who set up the ambush three years prior. Meanwhile, Shing sets up triad leader Yie and shoots him dead; the witnesses are told to lie to the police that Ho was the killer. Ho and Mark then use the tape to blackmail Shing in exchange for money and an escape boat. Ho ensures that the tape is passed to Kit as proof of Shing's crimes. Using Shing as a hostage, Ho and Mark take the money to a pier, where Shing's men await. There, Ho implores Mark to escape by himself in the boat, and Mark hesitantly agrees. After Mark's departure, Kit arrives on the scene intending to arrest Shing, but ends up being taken hostage. A deal is made to exchange Shing for Kit, but the negotiation spirals into first a standoff and eventually a shootout. Ho and Kit work together against Shing's men, and are overwhelmed. Mark, hearing the sounds of gunfire, quickly returns to the scene. Ho, Kit and Mark kill several of Shing's henchmen, but also suffer injuries in the process. During a lull in the gunfight, Ho attempts to make peace with Kit but is rebuffed again. Mark then reprimands Kit, telling him that Ho's present actions have atoned for the past. As the three are distracted however, Mark is fatally shot in the back by Shing. As the police approach, Shing mocks Ho and Kit, proclaiming that once he enters police custody, his money and power will ensure his swift release. Kit then hands Ho his gun, allowing him to fatally shoot Shing. As Kit watches Shing's body fall to the ground, Ho suddenly handcuffs himself to Kit. The two brothers then begin walking together towards the gathered crowd of police. ==Cast== == Production == The film is an uncredited remake of the 1967 Lung Kong film 英雄本色 (pinyin Yīngxióng běnsè) which has the same Chinese name but a different English name: Story of a Discharged Prisoner, which is No. 39 on the Hong Kong Film Awards list of the Top 100 Chinese Films. It was also partially inspired by The Brothers, a 1979 Hong Kong crime film, plot elements of which were reimagined for A Better Tomorrow. The Brothers had a similar plot about two brothers on opposing sides of the law, the elder brother a mobster and the younger brother a cop. In turn, The Brothers was a remake of Deewaar (1975), a hit Indian crime drama written by Salim–Javed. The scene in which Mark Lee tells the story of being forced to drink urine is apparently based on a real incident involving Chow Yun-fat and director Ringo Lam. This scene was recreated in Woo's Bullet in the Head, which was originally scripted as a prequel to A Better Tomorrow, before being changed to a standalone film. The English title is from the Lo Ta-yu song Tomorrow will be Better (明天会更好/明天會更好), which is traditionally sung during New Year's Eve, and is featured in the film. === Filming locations === thumb|right|The Tin Hau Temple Complex. thumb|right|The former Central Police station building. ==== Hong Kong ==== * Jackson Road, Central * Central Police Station, Central * Kennedy Town, Central and Western * Wan Chai, Wan Chai District * Saint Paul Seminary, Causeway Bay * Sunning Plaza, Causeway Bay * Kowloon Peak * To Kwa Wan, Kowloon City * Stonecutters Island * Tin Hau Temple Complex, Kowloon Peninsula * Wo Hop Shek Public Cemetery ==== Taiwan ==== * Ximending, Taipei * Renai Road, Taipei * Taichung Correctional Center, Taichung == Music == * During the nightclub scene, the song being played in the background (幾許風雨, "How Much Wind and Rain") is the Cantonese version of a classic South Korean song called 'Hee Na Ree' (희나리) sung originally by Goo Chang-mo in 1985.

A direct sequel, A Better Tomorrow 2, was released the following year. John Woo returned to direct, as did most of the main cast, with Chow Yun-fat playing Mark's hitherto-unmentioned twin brother Ken. A prequel, A Better Tomorrow III: Love & Death in Saigon, was released in 1989, with Chow returning to play Mark. Woo was not involved in the prequel, due to a falling-out with Tsui Hark, so Hark directed the film himself. Woo's unproduced screenplay draft was later made as Bullet in the Head (1990). The film has two official remakes. A Better Tomorrow (2010) was produced in South Korea, directed by Song Hae-sung, with John Woo serving as executive producer. A Better Tomorrow 2018 (2018) was produced in Mainland China, directed by Ding Sheng. ==Cultural impact== * After the film, teenage boys in Hong Kong wore long dusters in emulation of Chow's character even though the climate was sub- tropical. In fact, in colloquial Cantonese, trench coats are called "Mark Gor Lau" (literally, Brother Mark's coat). * The storyline (including dialogs and costumes) was made into a Thai film Diamond Kingdom (Phet Payak Kharat; ) in 1988 with many Thai performers involved. Sombat Metanee as Tanong (Sung Tse Ho in original version), Sorapong Chatree as Chat (Mark Lee in original version), Chairat Chittham as Ruj (Sung Tse Kit in original version), with Pumpuang Duangjan as Pen (Tanong's lover not in original version). It was created without copyright. * The Wu-Tang Clan has a song named after the film on their 1997 album Wu-Tang Forever. * The Wu-Tang Clan 20th anniversary album also shares the name A Better Tomorrow. *The anime series Cowboy Bebop has many references to the film series, including the last fight between Spike and Vicious in the episode "The Real Folk Blues (Part 2)" which parallels the final shoot out in "A Better Tomorrow 2". *The character Mr. Chang from the Black Lagoon is closely patterned after Chow's character Mark in both visual design and characterisation. *Chow wore Alain Delon sunglasses in the movie.

It is an official remake of the 1986 Hong Kong film A Better Tomorrow. It was directed by Song Hae-sung and produced by Fingerprint Pictures. John Woo, who directed the original 1986 version, acted as executive producer. The film premiered as part of Special Events at the 67th Venice International Film Festival on September 2, 2010, where it was introduced by John Woo, as having "its own character and own soul, and many new elements." It was released in theaters on September 16, 2010."A Better Tomorrow (2010) Mu-jeok-ja". Korean Film Biz Zone. Retrieved 2012-04-20. ==Plot== Kim Hyuk (Joo Jin-mo) is a detective in the South Korean National Police Agency, having escaped from North Korea as a teenager. Unbeknownst to his superiors, he also moonlights as an illegal arms smuggler with his best friend and partner in crime, Lee Young- choon (Song Seung-heon), who also defected from the North. Hyuk has a younger brother, Chul (Kim Kang-woo), whom he was forced to leave behind (along with their mother) during his escape. Guilt-ridden over leaving his brother behind, Hyuk has spent the past few years searching for his brother. Eventually, he finds Chul in an internment camp for Northern defectors, but Chul resents Hyuk for leaving them behind. It is then revealed that their mother was killed by North Korean authorities as retribution for Hyuk's escape. Hyuk goes to Thailand to complete an arms deal, accompanied by an ambitious gangster named Jung Tae-min (Jo Han-sun). However, the deal turns out to be a set-up by Jung, who leaves Hyuk to be killed by the Thai gangsters. He survives but gets arrested and sentenced to three years in prison. After reading about Hyuk's capture in the newspaper, Lee finds the Thai gangster in a massage parlor and kills him and his henchmen. However, in the ensuing gunfight, he is shot in the knee and crippled. Hyuk is released from prison. Remorseful and determined to start a new life, he finds work as a taxi driver. Meanwhile, Chul has become an officer in the National Police and Jung has become the leader of the arms smuggling operation, while Lee, cut out of the arms operation by Jung, does odd jobs to survive. During an emotional reunion, Lee asks Hyuk to return to the underworld and take revenge on Jung, but Hyuk refuses. He seeks Chul out, hoping for a reconciliation, but Chul rebuffs him, seeing Hyuk as nothing but a criminal and still resentful that Hyuk left the family in North Korea. Jung finds Hyuk and presses him to rejoin the organization, even offering to give Lee his old job back, but Hyuk refuses. Meanwhile, Chul becomes obsessed with arresting Jung. After Jung has Lee beaten and threatens to harm Chul, Hyuk decides to join his old friend in taking revenge on Jung. Hyuk and Lee steal incriminating evidence from the smuggling business, and Hyuk secretly sends it to the police while tricking Lee into paying him a large ransom. Using Jung as a hostage, Hyuk and Young-choon take the money to a pier, intending to escape by boat. Meanwhile, having followed his brother, Chul arrives on the scene but is captured by Jung's men. Even though he is free to escape, Hyuk decides to return to save Chul and asks Lee to leave with the money. Hyuk returns and offers to exchange Jung for Chul, but the trade explodes into a wild shootout. Hyuk and Chul are wounded and pinned down, but Lee suddenly appears and saves them. After killing many of Jung's men, Lee berates Chul, telling him that he should be grateful to have a brother like Hyuk. He is then shot in the back and killed by Jung's men. The police arrive, but Jung flees into a nearby steelyard. Hyuk and Chul chase after him, but Hyuk is shot and killed when he shields Chul from Jung's gunfire. Jung mocks Chul and prepares to surrender to the surrounding police. Despite warnings from the police to drop his weapon, Chul shoots and kills Jung. As the police advance, Chul cradles his brother's body in his arms and tearfully laments that he missed him. He aims his gun to his head and the scene cuts to black as a single gunshot is heard. ==Cast== * Joo Jin-mo – Kim Hyuk * Song Seung-heon – Lee Young-choon * Kim Kang-woo – Kim Chul * Jo Han-sun – Jung Tae-min * Lee Geung-young – Park Kyung-wi * Kim Ji-young – aunt * Kim Hae-gon – Boss Jung * Im Hyung-joon – Detective Lee * Lee Ki-hyuk as Combat police * Seo Tae-hwa – Public Prosecutor Jo * Jeong Gi-seop – Detective Park * Moon Kyung-min * Lee Sin-seong ==Differences between remake and original== * The protagonists are arms traffickers as opposed to counterfeiters. * Kim Hyuk is a police officer who moonlights as an illegal arms trafficker, whereas his counterpart in the original, Sung Chi-ho was not involved in law enforcement. * Chul is hostile and resentful towards Hyuk for his perceived abandonment as a teenager whereas Ho and Kit have a close fraternal relationship until Ho's arrest. * Young- choon is shown to be suspicious of Jung's motives, and Hyuk witnesses Jung's betrayal during the deal. In the original, Shing's duplicity is not revealed until much later in the film. * Unlike Kit, Chul does not have a girlfriend, hence no female roles. * It is implied that Young-choon works for himself (doing odd jobs) after being crippled whereas Mark is shown to work for Shing in the original. * Young-choon is shot and killed by a multitude of Jung's men whereas Mark was killed by Shing (and his right-hand man) directly. * Hyuk and Chul die in the remake whereas Ho and Kit both survive the final showdown and successfully reconcile in the original. ==Reception== In Korea, the film ranked second and grossed over in its first week of release,"South Korea Box Office: September 17–19, 2010".

In April 2012, GZA hinted that a new album was unlikely, saying: "I'm grateful for everything we have done throughout our careers and if there's nothing else to put out, then there's nothing to put out." In October 2012, RZA said a new Wu-Tang Clan album might happen after all, on the occasion of the group's 20th anniversary. In November 2012, Raekwon doubted a new album would happen, saying: "I want to see it happen, but more importantly, I want to see it done the right way."

Being that I feel the team is being compromised by his so-called "logic" of making music, I have a problem with that because I love my fans."

It made during its opening weekend in China. ===Critical response=== A Better Tomorrow 2018 received mixed reviews. Idarklight of Cfensi, in her positive review of the film, wrote "From some of the boldest music choices to drastic switches in tone of cinematography to one of the most interesting shootout scenes in a while, A Better Tomorrow 2018 felt like a firework so bursting with life that it left me too busy savoring every minute details of brilliance to think about its flaws. You can just feel how much love and thought director Ding Sheng and the cast put into every scene. Even all the jokes avoid lazy one-liners but instead are all carefully set-up earlier to land perfectly." Pablo A. Tariman of Star Cinema praised the film and wrote, "The film delivers as a crime- action flick. The actors give their characters an earthy feel and they remain unscathed all throughout the bloodshed saga." Conversely, LP Hugo of Asia Film Strike gave the film a negative review, wrote "A solid crime drama on its own terms, A Better Tomorrow 2018 can however not sustain comparison with the original. But despite a wavering tone, some heavy-handed references, it still manages to introduce interesting variations, and benefits from Wang Kai’s charisma." Sean Gilman of MUBI Notebook Column, wrote "There’s nothing especially unusual about a bland, over-edited and undercooked crime movie. And without the A Better Tomorrow connection Ding Sheng’s film would barely be noticed among the sea of mediocrity that is mainstream Mainland cinema." ===Accolades=== A Better Tomorrow 2018 received two nominations at the 4th Annual International Jackie Chan Action Movie Week, one for Best Movie Stunt and one for Best New Actor In Action for Wang Talu. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2018 films Category:Chinese action films Category:Chinese crime drama films Category:2010s crime drama films Category:Sparkle Roll Media films Category:Films directed by Ding Sheng Category:Yakuza films Category:2018 drama films Category:2010s Mandarin-language films Category:2010s Japanese films
3365741	A Better Tomorrow II	A Better Tomorrow 2 is a 1987 Hong Kong action film written and directed by John Woo. A follow-up to its popular predecessor, A Better Tomorrow, the film stars returning cast members Chow Yun-fat, Ti Lung and Leslie Cheung alongside new cast member Dean Shek. The film was released in Hong Kong on 17 December 1987. Due to the popularity of Chow's break-out performance in the previous instalment, he was cast in a new character as the twin brother of "Mark", who was killed in the previous film. A Better Tomorrow 2 is known for its over the top violence, exaggerated blood and gore, and body counts nearing the hundreds. Film director John Woo and producer Tsui Hark had disagreements over the focus of this film. Tsui felt that the film should focus more on Dean Shek's character. This led to the film being edited by both Tsui and Woo. Their disagreements would lead to a split after this film, with Hark directing A Better Tomorrow 3 and Woo moving on to create The Killer. ==Plot== Several years after his arrest, Sung Tse-ho is offered early parole by the police in exchange for spying on his former boss and mentor, Lung Sei, who is suspected of heading a counterfeiting operation. Inspector Wu, the leader of the task force, wants to mark his retirement with the capture of a high profile criminal like Lung. Though Ho initially declines because of his loyalty to Lung, he eventually changes his mind when he discovers that his younger brother, Kit, who is expecting a child along with his pregnant wife Jackie, is working undercover on the same case. While working the case, the two brothers meet and agree to work together. After being framed for murder, Lung seeks Ho's help, who is able to help him escape to New York. However, Lung suffers a psychotic break and is institutionalized after receiving news of his daughter's murder and witnessing the death of a friend. Meanwhile, Ho learns that his deceased friend Mark Lee has a long-lost twin brother, Ken, a former gang member who left Hong Kong as a teenager to travel across America, eventually opening a restaurant in New York City. Ho then locates Ken and enlists his assistance in freeing Lung. Targeted by both assassins attempting to kill Lung as well as American mobsters looking to extort Ken, Ken and a catatonic Lung take refuge in an apartment building where Ken arms himself. During a shoot-out with their attackers, Ken and Lung find themselves cornered; seeing Ken in trouble snaps Lung out of his stupor, and he kills the last of their pursuers. The two return to Hong Kong and regroup with Ho and Kit. The group discovers that one of Lung's employees, Ko Ying-pui, is responsible for attempt on Lung's life and has since taken over the organization in Lung's absence. Lung decides that he would rather destroy his organization with his own hands than let it fall into dishonor and ruin, and the group starts planning to act against Ko. After scouting out Ko's mansion alone, Kit is fatally wounded, but is rescued by Ken, who attempts to rush him to the hospital. Knowing that he will not make it however, Kit persuades Ken to stop at a phone booth to call Jackie, where he manages to name his newborn child Sung Ho-yin ("the Spirit of Righteousness") before succumbing to his wounds. After attending Kit's funeral, Ho, Ken, and Lung take revenge on Ko by attacking his mansion during a meeting with a counterfeiting client. The three manage to kill Ko and several of his men following an intense shootout, but are all critically wounded in the process. Following the shootout, the three men sit down in the mansion and are surrounded by the police forces led by Inspector Wu. Upon seeing the condition of the men, Wu orders his men to stand down, while Ho remarks against Inspector Wu's retirement, as there is "much work left for [him] to do." ==Cast== *Dean Shek as Lung Sei *Chow Yun-fat as Ken "Gor" Lee *Ti Lung as Sung Tse-ho *Leslie Cheung as Sung Tse-kit *Emily Chu as Jackie Sung (Tse-kit's wife) *Kwan Shan as Ko Ying-pui (The main antagonist) *Kenneth Tsang as Ken (The taxi manager from the first film) *Shing Fui-On as Ko's partner *Lam Chung as Ko's partner *Ng Man-tat as Mr Wong (during the early stage of his film career) *Peter Wang as Sam (Lung's priest friend in New York) *Lung Ming-yan as Chong (Ko's cold blooded hitman) *Louis Roth as Protection Money Collector *Regina Kent as Peggy Lung (Lung's daughter) *Ken Boyle as New York Counterfeit Buyer *Lau Siu-ming as Chief Inspector Wu *Mike Abbott as Assassin *Cindy Lau as Ken's restaurant staff *Steve Mak as Ko's thug A Better Tomorrow 2 at HKMDB A Better Tomorrow 2 at chinesemov.com ==Music== ===Theme song=== ;"Will Rush Toward Future Day" (奔向未來日子) :*Lyrics: Wong Jim :*Composition and Arrangement: Joseph Koo :*Performance: Leslie Cheung ===Music cues=== This film contains music cues from other films: *"Birdy's Flight (From 'Not One of Us')" **Composer: Peter Gabriel **From: Birdy (1984) *"Leo Gets It" **Composer: Gary Chang **From: 52 Pick-Up (1987) *"The Set-Up" **Composer: Jerry Goldsmith **From: Extreme Prejudice (1987) ==Release== The film was theatrically released in Hong Kong on 17 December 1987.

Although generally playing alto, Fortune is also heard on soprano and flute ... While not one of Fortune's most essential releases (one wishes that he had played some tenor too), A Better Understanding has enough variety and surprises to make it recommended".

52245959	A Better Way	A Better Way was a conservative agenda for U.S. governance, crafted by former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan as well as Kevin Brady, former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. Ryan called the six-point plan "a complete alternative to the Left's agenda". Shortly after the 2016 United States elections, Speaker Ryan said that the plan, described by Reuters as an "aggressive Republican legislative agenda", provides a blueprint for laws he expected to spearhead in the Republican congress in cooperation with the Republican Trump administration. For someone other than the party's nominee to direct the party's agenda in a presidential election year was termed "a rare move". ==Six-point plan== The plan covers six points: Poverty, National Security, Economy, Constitution, Health Care, and Tax Reform. The points in the plan, which Speaker Ryan intended to press forward in the 2017-2018 115th Congress, had been described as "mostly ignor[ing] the areas where Trump's agenda clash with tenets of conservative doctrine" such as trade policy, immigration reform and entitlement cuts. It did not cover some points that were major issues in the presidential campaign, such as a border wall with Mexico and banning immigrants who are Muslims. #Poverty #:Proponents of the plan believe that welfare reform can address systemic problems of poverty in America. Critics say the plan will "cut the social safety net". #National Security #:The national security plan contains four sub-points: "defeat the terrorists," "protect the homeland," "tackle new threats" and "defend freedom". It further addresses border security with a plan to "accelerate the deployment of fencing, technology, air assets, and personnel at the border". The plan was said to "push back" on Trump's "America First" agenda enunciated during the presidential campaign. #U.S. economy #Constitutional rule #:The constitution plan contains four sub-points: stopping executive overreach, reining in regulators, imposing new limits on spending, and increasing transparency #Healthcare #:House Republicans plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act ("Obamacare") #Tax reform #:A number of proposed changes to the United States tax code have been announced by the United States House Committee on Ways and Means. The proposal would reduce the federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent as well as repealing the corporate alternative minimum tax (“AMT”). Depreciation rules would be replaced with expensing new investment in equipment, structures, and intellectual property. Depreciation or expensing deduction would not be allowed for land, and inventories would be subject to last-in-first-out (LIFO) accounting. In addition, the deductibility of net interest expense would be eliminated. Additionally, corporate tax would be "border adjusted", which would mean that exports would be exempt from the tax and imports subject to it. == Border adjustment == One of the largest revenue increasing proposals of the plan is reform of corporate tax which is "border adjusted." This would mean that exports would be exempt from tax and imports would be subject to it. The Economist and others note that this may fall foul of World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. Bloomberg View noted that the proposed tax would favour domestically produced goods as they would be taxed less than imports, to a degree varying across sectors. For example, the wage component of the cost of domestically produced goods would not be taxed. Because the United States imports more than it exports, border adjustability would raise $1.2trn over a decade, covering almost two-thirds of the cost of cutting the tax rate to 20%, according to the Tax Policy Centre. On January 16, Donald Trump commented that a border adjustment tax would be "too complicated" in a Wall Street Journal article. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated on January 26 said that the proposal was "one idea" of the administration in regards to tax policy. ==Proposed== * 1.

37384484	A Better World (organization)	A Better World (ABW) is an organization that is based in Lacombe, Alberta, Canada. It is a charitable organization, formed in 1990. Eric Rajah is one of the co-founders of ABW. More than 1800 people had volunteered on ABW projects by 2010. ==Projects== ABW has several projects in Kenya, including the support of a hospital in Maasai Mara. ABW has also provided humanitarian aid to Burmese refugees in India. In 2009, Cross Roads Church in Red Deer considered partnering with ABW on a project to give two internally displaced persons camps in Kosti, Sudan, access to a water source. In 2011, Azalea Lehndorff started the 100 Classroom Project, an ABW initiative that educates girls in Afghanistan. The goal of the project is to build 100 classrooms in Jowzjan Province in the space of three years. ABW has also helped with building development of St Luke's Leprosarium, Peikulum in Tamil Nadu. ==Partnership with Raise Their Voice== ABW partnered with Raise Their Voice throughout the 2012 tour of Andrew Kooman's She Has a Name; while the play toured across Canada to raise awareness about human trafficking, ABW raised money to help women and children who had been trafficked in Thailand as part of the country's prostitution industry. Specifically, the money raised went to Home of New Beginnings, a safe house established in Bangkok in 2006, where former human trafficking victims can receive life skills-based education and spiritual healing, thereby allowing them to attain a healthy and financially stable lifestyle. At the time of the 2012 tour of the play, Home of New Beginnings had 17 residents, the oldest being 33 and the youngest being 11. From their fundraising initiative with Raise Their Voice, ABW hoped to raise $12000 to pay an outstanding property bill, $18000 to buy two auto rickshaws, $9000 to finance a training building, $9000 to buy vocational education equipment, and $5000 to finance a gift shop in which the residents sell products they have made, such as baked goods. All five members of Raise Their Voice had previous connections with ABW, and the plan to have the two organizations working in conjunction had been developing since 2011. The program passed out at each performance recommended ABW to audiences as a good organization to support, as well as listing the websites of several other nonprofit organizations. ==References== Category:Adventist organizations established in the 20th century Category:Children's charities based in Canada Category:Christian educational organizations Category:Development charities based in Canada Category:Independent ministries of the Seventh-day Adventist Church Category:International volunteer organizations Category:Lacombe, Alberta Category:Organizations based in Alberta Category:Foreign charities operating in Kenya Category:Foreign charities operating in Thailand Category:Social welfare parachurch organizations Category:Human trafficking in Thailand

30230015	A Bewildered Lovebird	A Bewildered Lovebird () is a 2010 Egyptian film. == Plot == Bolbol wakes up in a full-body cast after a mysterious accident shattered every last bone in his body. He's lying in a hospital bed, where he'll probably spend the next few weeks, and with him is Dr. Amal, a dedicated physician taking care of his needs. Bolbol warms up to the perky doctor and shares with her his story with her in painstaking detail. As the owner of a small ad agency, he first meets Yasmin, a harmonica playing member of a rock band. At first Bolbol is smitten by her carefree attitude and lack of jealousy until the novelty wears off. Just as his fondness turns into frustration towards Yasmin, in walks Hala, a helpless girl who is in many ways the polar opposite of Yasmin. Bolbol spends more and more time with Hala, ultimately falling for her, but at the same time he can't shake off his love for Yasmin. Both women seem to have something that Bolbol desires, and our poor hero is torn between the two. And therein lies his predicament: should Bolbol go for the independent, self-empowered though occasionally cold Yasmin? Or is the submissive and helpless Hala a better fit for his traditionalist values, even though she can be very overbearing? == Cast == * Ahmed Helmy as Bolbol * Zeina as Yasmin * Shery Adel as Hala * Emy Samir Ghanem as Dr. Amal == See also == *Cinema of Egypt == External links == * Category:2010 films Category:2010s Arabic-language films Category:Films set in Egypt Category:2010 romantic comedy-drama films Category:Egyptian romantic comedy-drama films Category:2010 comedy films Category:2010 drama films
6164295	A Bewitched Place	"A Bewitched Place" is the last story in the second volume of Nikolai Gogol's first collection of short stories, Evenings on a Farm Near Dikanka (1832). thumb|A Bewitched Place Like the concluding tale of the first volume, "The Lost Letter: A Tale Told by the Sexton of the N...Church", it is told by an exuberant Cossack narrator, the old sexton Foma, who says that the tale is about his grandfather. ==Plot== Foma's grandfather takes care of melons and spends most of his time at a shanty nearby, taking pleasure in groups of wagons that come by with various items. One day, while discussing matters with some passing wagoneers, his grandfather decides to outdo Foma and his friend at dancing. He does quite well until he reaches a spot in the garden where he cannot seem to move and his legs stiffen up. He curses the devil, and tries his luck again. Suddenly he is transported to a different area that seems to be the local priest's garden. He comes up to a gravestone that is shimmering, and marks it with a stick believing there to be treasure below somewhere. When he comes home he won't discuss what happened and ventures out the next day to find the spot. When he gets to the priest's garden, he cannot spot the gravestone above the buried treasure and he curses the devil again for tricking him. The next day, Foma's grandfather explores the place where he could not dance the day before and finds that this spot is capable of magically transporting him to the cemetery where the grave is marked. He digs and finds a cauldron, while being mocked by a bird, a sheep and a bear, that, in a horrifying manner, repeat what he says. After he finds the treasure, the devil tries to terrify him again by making it appear as though he was below a precipice ready to come down on him with a monstrous head peeping from behind it. He is not frightened though and takes the cauldron back home. His wife, thinking the boys are behind it as it comes towards her, throws dirty dishwater behind it, covering him with melon waste. He tells them what he found but when he opens the cauldron finds filth and from that day forward never trusts the devil again and crosses himself whenever he comes to a spot said to have something wrong with it. He fences off the area where he couldn't dance and has everyone throw all the garbage and weeds they collect on the spot. ==External links== * Category:Short stories by Nikolai Gogol Category:1832 short stories Category:Short stories about Cossacks Category:Short stories set in the Russian Empire

3461364	A Bicyclops Built for Two	"A Bicyclops Built for Two" is the ninth episode in the second season of the American animated television series Futurama, and the 22nd episode of the series overall. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on March 19, 2000. ==Plot== The Professor announces to the Planet Express crew that he has finally logged onto AOL after years of trying and sends them into the Internet for fun. While playing the video game Death Factory III, Leela meets another cyclops, but Fry blasts his virtual form before she can find out who he is and where he comes from. The crew is sent on a mission to deliver popcorn to Cineplex 14. However, the other cyclops recorded her screen name beforehand and sends her a video message. Leela abandons the delivery and heads off to the coordinates provided. The cyclops introduces himself as Alcazar, sole survivor of the destruction of the planet Cyclopia. He shows Leela some of the capital city's landmarks, including the sacred Forbidden Valley, before bringing her to the castle where he lives. He says Cyclopia was destroyed by a missile launched by the blind mole people of Subterra 3. Before the destruction, Cyclopia's smartest scientist sent away a baby who Leela concludes must have been her. Alcazar was employed as a pool cleaner and was spared from the chaos while fishing out a dead possum. Leela decides it is her duty to help rebuild the Cyclopian civilization, primarily by procreating with Alcazar. Now that Leela is committed to Alcazar for the good of their race, he becomes abusive towards her, demanding she carry out menial work and humiliating her in front of his friends. While Bender loots everything of value, Fry, feeling suspicious of Alcazar, tries to investigate the Forbidden Valley, only to stumble into a trap door leading to a dungeon. When Leela visits Fry in the dungeon, she reveals she hates Alcazar for the way he treats her, so Fry convinces her to dump him; she almost dumps him until he proposes marriage. Wanting to extend their race, Leela reluctantly accepts. When Leela refuses Fry's entreaties to let him out of the dungeon, he escapes and breaks into the Forbidden Valley with Bender. They discover four other castles, identical except that the decorations depict different species. They return and interrupt Leela's wedding, bringing with them four women, each of a different species, and each scheduled to be married to Alcazar on the same day as Leela. Alcazar, flustered, involuntarily reveals his true form as a shapeshifting, cricket-like alien. After the women beat him into submission, he explains that he played with their emotions in order to get free labor for his castles, and that he had to stage all the weddings on one day because tuxedos that change shape are expensive to rent. As Leela leaves with the rest of the Planet Express crew, the Professor tries to reassure her she will find her true home, but she disconsolately wonders "How many planets could there be?" as she looks out at a vast, starry space. ==Cultural references== The new look that Leela takes on to please "Al" parodies voice actor Katey Sagal's role as Peggy Bundy (with husband Al) on Married... with Children. The scene also lampoons the show's dysfunctional family sitcom style and marriage/sex related jokes. In the beginning of the episode, when Bender opens the portal to the Internet, Fry's exclamation of "My God...it's full of ads!" is a reference to Dave Bowman's line "My God...it's full of stars!" in the novel 2001: A Space Odyssey and the film 2010. As the portal opens, the characteristic theme "Also Sprach Zarathustra" from 2001: A Space Odyssey plays. Alcazar's story of Cyclopia's demise also parodies Superman's origin story, in which his father sends him in an experimental vessel to travel through hyperspace before their home planet Krypton is destroyed. One of the alien women that Alcazar is pledged to is a member of the Great Race of Yith from H. P. Lovecraft's The Shadow out of Time. The name Cineplex 14 is a spoof of the Canadian company Cineplex Entertainment. When the popcorn is thrown into the sun, it makes a shape of a galaxy, the logo of Galaxy Cinemas, one of the companies that merged to make Cineplex Entertainment. ==Reception== Color stylist Bari Kumar won an Emmy award for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Animation for this episode in 2000. Susie Dietter was nominated for an Annie Award in 2000 for "Outstanding Individual Achievement for Directing in an Animated Television Production" for this episode; she lost to Brian Sheesley for the Futurama episode "Why Must I Be a Crustacean in Love?". In Doug Pratt's DVD, Pratt noted that this episode was his favorite of the second season. In particular, he notes that the virtual reality sequence at the beginning was very witty and the overall plot was entertaining. The episode was given an A rating by The A.V. Club. In its initial airing, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 4.0/7, placing it 86th among primetime shows for the week of March 13–19, 2000. ==References== ==External links== *"A Bicyclops Built for Two" at The Infosphere * Category:Futurama (season 2) episodes Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Fiction about shapeshifting

74044699	A Bid for Fortune; Or, Doctor Nikola's Vendetta	A Bid for Fortune; Or, Doctor Nikola's Vendetta (1895) is a novel by Australian writer Guy Boothby. It was his first novel to feature his recurring character Dr. Nikola. It was originally serialised in The Windsor Magazine : An Illustrated Monthly for Men and Women over 22 issues in 1895, and was then published in the United Kingdom by Ward, Lock and Bowden in the same year. ==Abstract== "In this first novel, the protagonist is a young Australian, Richard Hatteras, who has made a small fortune in pearl-diving operations in the Thursday Islands. With money in his pocket, he decides to travel. Visiting Sydney before taking ship for England, he meets and falls in love with the daughter of the Colonial Secretary, Sylvester Wetherell. As the story moves on, it is revealed that Wetherell has fallen foul of the evil Dr. Nikola, who has developed a devious scheme to force Wetherell to submit in to his demands to give him a mysterious oriental object he has acquired. The life and liberty of Hatteras’ lady-love are imperilled as Nikola's plot moves on, and Hatteras has to make strenuous efforts to locate and free her." ==Publishing history== Following the book's initial magazine serialisation, and then publication by Ward, Lock and Bowden in 1895 it was subsequently published as follows: * Appleton, 1895, USA; reprinted 1897 * Ward, Lock & Co., 1902, UK; reprinted 1906, 1918, 1919, and 1929 And subsequent paperback and ebook editions. The novel was translated into Finnish (1904), Swedish (1907) and Danish (1916). ==Critical reception== Everett F. Bleiler in Science-Fiction: The Early Years notes that the book is included in his volume even though it "is not science- fiction, but is included since it gives background." He goes on to describe the novel: "Vulgar, carelessly plotted, unconvincing, it is at times almost a parody of the late Victorian adventure story." ==Film adaptation== In 1917 a silent film adaptation, titled A Bid for Fortune, was released. It was directed by Sidney Morgan from a script by Guy Boothby. ==See also== * 1895 in Australian literature ==References== Category:1895 Australian novels Category:1895 books
9848866	A Big 10-8 Place	A Big 10-8 Place is the third album by Negativland, released in 1983. It was the first album with the involvement of band member Don Joyce. The album's title is a reference to the radio ten-code "10-8," which means "back in service" or "available for next call" in the context of common CB radio usage. The lyrics and collage sound clips on the album make frequent reference to the CB radio hobby, as well as mischief like jamming. The original release had unusual packaging, and included a small plastic bag of lawn clippings (or mulch), a "No Other Possibility" bumper sticker, and a map of Contra Costa county, where the band originated. Contra Costa county is frequently mentioned on the track "180-G, a Big 10-8 Place, Pt. Two." The album was re-released by Seeland Records, then with distribution from Mordam Records, in 1994. It was re-released again in 2007 by Seeland, packaged with a DVD release of No Other Possibility, Negativland's video release. ==Critical reception== AllMusic wrote that the album "fired the opening volley in Negativland's ongoing challenge against copyrights and what is considered public domain." Trouser Press called the album "as much a loving tribute as a scathing indictment of suburbia’s soulless facade, the record is a richly detailed, remarkably complex combination of the inorganic (electronics and industrial atmospherics) and the human (voices discuss whatever)." The Chicago Tribune called it a "trippy travelogue." == Track listing == ==References== Category:1983 albums Category:Negativland albums Category:Concept albums Category:Citizens band radio in popular culture Category:Sound collage albums
72428348	A Big Bad Beautiful Noise	A Big Bad Beautiful Noise is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Godfathers. It was released on 10 February 2017 on their own Godfathers Recordings label and distributed by Cargo in Europe and Metropolis in the US. It marks the first Godfathers album without bassist Chris Coyne, and the only album to feature the lineup of singer Peter Coyne with new members Steve Crittall (guitar), Mauro Venegas (guitar), Darren Birch (bass), and Tim James (drums). ==Background== Steve Crittall, Mauro Venegas and Tim James had joined the Godfathers in 2014 when the previous lineup had disintegrated. Joining founding members Peter and Chris Coyne, they recorded the double A-side vinyl single "Rewind Time"/"Till My Heart Stops Beating", which was released in June 2015. Chris Coyne left the band in 2016 and was replaced by Darren Birch just in time for the recording of A Big Bad Beautiful Noise. The album was recorded in the summer of 2016 at Bridge Studio in Birmingham and mixed at Racknophobia Studio in London. The Birmingham studio was chosen after owner and engineer Paul Robert Gray – a friend of Birmingham residents Darren Birch and Tim James – offered his help and studio. Production duties were shared between Steve Crittall, Paul Robert Gray and the band. Gray also contributed percussion to a handful of tracks on the album. The only album track not recorded in Birmingham – "Till My Heart Stops Beating" – was produced by Teo Miller at London's Cowshed Studio and mixed at Retone Sound Studio. It was partially overdubbed and remixed for the album. The album title comes from a phrase used by Peter Coyne to describe the band's music to journalists, and after seeing the quote written down in black and white print, he decided to turn it into a song. With its observations about modern life, and what Coyne describes as "the feeling of anti-establishment rebellion in the air and social disorder," he turned the song into "a joyous anthem." Mauro Venegas left the band in 2017 and was replaced by Alex McBain. In 2019, the entire band was abruptly and controversially fired through Facebook by Peter Coyne, who later in the year assembled an all-new Godfathers lineup. ==Critical reception== The album was well received by critics, who felt that the band maintained their signature sound while still sounding energetic and vital. Both Classic Rock and Pennyblackmusic felt it was the Godfathers' best album in three decades, and Louder Than War wrote that the album "will remind you of everything you liked about the Godfathers in the first place but has been updated in a vibrant way for 2017 ... replete with shit-hot musicianship, catchy songs, tonnes of conviction and a big bad attitude." Classic Rock stated, "The band still hop madly from foot to foot – Stiff Records one minute, Creation the next – but they have solidified over the years into a definably hard rock'n'roll band." The Agit Reader felt that the album contained some "ham-fisted lyrics," and songs that "never seem to get off the ground, no matter how ferociously they're played." However, as a whole, they described the album as "an undeniable, flat out rocker that not only makes you turn it up, but also dig into the back catalog." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from the album liner notes. ;The Godfathers *Peter Coyne – vocals, lyrics *Steve Crittall – guitar, slide guitar, backing vocals, theremin (6), Farfisa organ (4), programming (4) *Mauro Venegas – guitar, acoustic guitar, backing vocals *Darren Birch – bass, acoustic bass, backing vocals *Tim James – drums, backing vocals ;Additional musicians *John Dale – keyboards (4, 9, 11) *Paul Robert Gray – percussion (1, 3, 6, 8) ;Technical *Steve Crittall – producer (1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10), mixing (1, 3-11) *The Godfathers – producer (3, 6, 9, 11) *Paul Robert Gray – producer, mixing (3, 6, 9, 11), additional recording and remix (2) *Teo Miller – producer, mixing (2) *Andy Pearce – mastering *Jaime Martin – artwork ==References== Category:2017 albums Category:The Godfathers albums
13762484	A Big Boy Did It and Ran Away	A Big Boy Did It and Ran Away (2001) is Christopher Brookmyre's sixth novel, the first book in a suspense trilogy featuring policewoman Angelique de Xavia. She is the central character in The Sacred Art of Stealing (2002) and the main protagonist in A Snowball in Hell (2008). Her antagonist in this novel, Simon Darcourt, reappears in A Snowball in Hell, where their relationship is resolved. A Big Boy touches on a number of Brookmyre's interests, including gaming, rock and roll (especially Glaswegian), and childhood. ==Plot summary== Anti-terrorist forces are put on alert when it is learned that the notorious international terrorist the Black Spirit plans to attack on an unknown British target on Saturday, September 6. The Black Spirit is an ingenious terrorist- for-hire known for his clever, often indirect means of achieving destruction; the terrorist organizations that hire him then claim the hit. He himself, however, claims his kills by leaving a literal "calling card," an image of the comic figure Rank Badjin by the Glasgow cartoonist Bud Neill. Meanwhile, 30-something Raymond Ash is struggling to cope with the banality of his new life, having sold his video game shop and decided to settle down with his wife, a new baby, and a new career as an English teacher in Glasgow. While visiting Glasgow airport he sees his college friend Simon Darcourt, who supposedly died when terrorists blew up an airliner a few years before. He has no idea that Darcourt is in reality the Black Spirit. Darcourt for his part sees Raymond and decides to settle an old score with him by incorporating him into his terrorist plot. Raymond ends up being abducted by Darcourt's terrorists, along with a couple of 13-year-old boys from his school (whose presence is unknown to the gang). Raymond escapes, then finds himself aiding Glasgow policewoman Angelique de Xavia in a valiant attempt to foil their plot, the two being the only people with a chance of reaching the site of the attack in time – the (fictional) Highlands hydroelectric plant at Dubh Ardrain. ==Characters== Point-of-view characters: ; Angelique de Xavia: Glasgow Police Detective Inspector. She is a Glaswegian, born to Ugandan refugees of Asian ethnicity, who has always felt herself an outsider. She is an expert in several martial arts and is known for her temper. ; Simon Darcourt: Once an aspiring rock star in bands where his narcissism alienated his fellow musicians, he discovered that planning and executing murders in ingenious ways was very satisfying, and eventually became an important international terrorist-for-hire. His intelligent, articulate, and complete contempt for his fellow man provides the blackest humor in the novel. His name, like that of Jack Parlabane in other novels by Brookmyre, is derived from a character in Robertson Davies's novel The Rebel Angels. ; Raymond Ash: 30-something newbie English teacher and exhausted father of a new baby. He was a college friend (and admirer) of Simon Darcourt, and the drummer in the first band Simon tried to front. Brookmyre, whose novel Bedlam (2013) was actually turned into a video game, uses Ash to explore the value of first-person- shooter gaming, integrating Ash's experience as a child imagining enemies, his experience fighting terrorists in Dubh Ardrain, and his gaming skills. ; Lexy and Wee Murph: Two boys from Raymond’s school who stow away in the terrorists’ truck, figure out the nature of the plot, and sabotage it. Their dialogue is phonetically spelled. They recall the children in Brookmyre’s A Tale Etched in Blood and Hard Black Pencil, (2006), transported to a fantasy adventure. ==Reception== The novel originally appeared with the cheerful tagline, "Terrorism - It's The New Rock'n'Roll," but the events of September 11, 2001 completely changed the potential of a black comedy based on a terrorist attack on Saturday, September 6. Note: September 6, 2001 was a Thursday, not a Saturday as in the book; however, retrospectively in the sequel the year of the Dubh Ardrain attack is given as in 2001. == References == Category:2001 British novels Category:Novels by Christopher Brookmyre Category:Little, Brown and Company books Category:English-language novels

6788669	A Big Hand for the Little Lady	A Big Hand for the Little Lady (released in the UK under the misleading title Big Deal at Dodge City, as the film is set in Laredo, Texas) is a 1966 American Western film made by Eden Productions Inc. and released by Warner Bros. The film was produced and directed by Fielder Cook from a screenplay by Sidney Carroll, adapted from their TV play Big Deal in Laredo which aired on The DuPont Show of the Week in 1962. The film stars Henry Fonda, Joanne Woodward, and Jason Robards. The original TV play starred Walter Matthau as Meredith. ==Plot== The five richest men in the territory gather in Laredo for their annual high-stakes poker game. The high rollers let nothing get in the way of their yearly showdown. When undertaker Tropp (Charles Bickford) calls for them in his horse-drawn hearse, cattleman Henry Drummond (Robards) forces a postponement of his daughter's wedding, while lawyer Otto Habershaw (Kevin McCarthy) abandons his closing arguments in a trial, with his client's life hanging in the balance. They are joined by Wilcox (Robert Middleton) and Buford (John Qualen) in the back room of Sam's saloon, while the curious gather outside for occasional reports. Settler Meredith (Fonda), his wife Mary (Joanne Woodward), and their young son Jackie (Gerald Michenaud) are passing through, on their way to purchase a farm near San Antonio, when a wheel on their wagon breaks. They wait at Sam's while the local blacksmith repairs it. Meredith, a recovering gambler, learns of the big poker game and begins to feel the excitement once again. The newcomer buys into the game, eventually staking all of the family savings, meant to pay for a home. The game builds to a climactic hand; the gamblers raise and reraise until more than $20,000 are in the pot. Meredith, out of cash, is unable to call the latest raise. Under the strain, he collapses. The town physician, Joseph "Doc" Scully (Burgess Meredith), is called to care for the stricken man. Barely conscious, Meredith signals for his wife to play out the hand. Taking his seat, Mary asks, "How do you play this game?" At this, the other players object loudly, but eventually give in. The situation is explained to her; if she cannot match the last raise (and any others that may follow), she will be out of the hand. Despite the men's protests, she leaves the room to borrow additional funds. With Jackie and four of the players trailing behind, Mary crosses the street and talks to the owner of the Cattle and Merchants' Bank, C. P. Ballinger (Paul Ford). After she shows him her hand, Ballinger suggests she is playing a practical joke. When he is told otherwise, he lends her $5,500 (at 6% interest) and makes a $5,000 raise for her. The other players, aware of Ballinger's tightfisted, cautious nature, all reluctantly fold. Mary collects her sizable winnings and pays Ballinger back with interest. The game then breaks up, no one ever having seen the winning hand. The lady's determination earns her the admiration of the men. Drummond is so touched that when he returns home to the waiting wedding ceremony, he talks privately to his weak-willed, prospective son-in-law, gives him some money, and orders him to run away and find himself a better wife than his daughter. In the end, Meredith, Mary, and even their "son" are revealed to be confidence tricksters and expert card sharps. With the help of Scully—who dreams of romance far from the tedium and poverty of a country doctor's life—and at Ballinger's behest, they have perpetrated a scam on the other poker players, who had swindled the banker in a real-estate deal 16 years before. "Mary" is actually Ballinger's mistress, Ruby. She promised him she would give up gambling after the caper, but she sits down to another poker game, much to Ballinger's dismay, as the credits roll. ==Cast== * Henry Fonda as Meredith/Benny * Joanne Woodward as Mary/Ruby * Jason Robards as Henry P.G. Drummond * Paul Ford as C.P. Ballinger * Charles Bickford as Benson Tropp * Burgess Meredith as Doc Joseph Scully * Kevin McCarthy as Otto Habershaw * Robert Middleton as Dennis Wilcox * John Qualen as Jesse Buford * Percy Helton as Kevin McKenzie * Gerald Michenaud as Jackie * James Kinney as Sam Rhine * Allen Collins as Toby * Jim Boles as Pete * Virginia Gregg as Mrs. Drummond * Chester Conklin as Old Man In Saloon * Mae Clarke as Mrs. Craig * Ned Glass as Owney Price * James Griffith as Mr. Stribling * Noah Keen as Sparrow ==Nominations== Joanne Woodward was nominated for the Golden Laurel Award for Female Comedy Performance.A Big Hand for the Little Lady (1966) - Awards ==Reception== The New York Times' Robert Alden enjoyed the film, praising the “seasoned set of actors” in the cast: “They are a skillful bunch, and it is a pleasure seeing real film professionals having at each other. A foxier bunch of artful poker rascals would be hard to find” crediting Meredith with “perhaps the most memorable performance of the lot.” Observing that “Lee Garmes, (is) one of the master camera hands of the West, and the roving camera eye of Mr. Garmes and company provides some of the film's best moments,” Alden adds “the mixing of comedy and tragedy is sometimes uncomfortable for an audience” seeing it for the first time. However, the “delightful surprise ending” ...”makes the feast worthwhile. “ ==See also== * List of American films of 1966 ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:1966 films Category:1966 Western (genre) films Category:American Western (genre) films Category:1960s English-language films Category:Films about con artists Category:Films directed by Fielder Cook Category:Films scored by David Raksin Category:Films set in Texas Category:Films about poker Category:Warner Bros. films Category:Films based on television plays Category:1960s American films

785456	A Big Hunk o' Love	"A Big Hunk o' Love" is a song recorded by Elvis Presley and released as a single on June 23, 1959 by RCA Victor, which topped the Billboard Hot 100 for two weeks. The song was revived by Presley in 1972 during his engagements at the Las Vegas Hilton in February 1972 and was used in his live shows until mid-1973. It was performed live for the last time on January 26, 1974. The song is included in the 1972 documentary Elvis On Tour and his 1973 show broadcast via satellite, Aloha from Hawaii. During this time period, it was played by the Elvis' TCB Band, and featured Glen D. Hardin and James Burton. The song was written by Aaron Schroeder and Sidney Wyche, under the name Sid Jaxon and published by Elvis Presley's company Gladys Music, Inc. Aaron Schroeder (along with Wally Gold), also wrote "It's Now or Never" and "Good Luck Charm", both of which, like "A Big Hunk o' Love", were originally recorded by American rock and roll icon Elvis Presley. Syd Wyche is best known for writing the jazz standard "Alright, Okay, You Win", whereas Aaron Schroeder co-wrote many hits in the rock`n`roll area, from "Fools Hall of Fame" (Pat Boone) to "Because They're Young" (Duane Eddy). In an interview conducted by Jan-Erik Kjeseth, he also revealed that in fact he worked with his partner Wally Gold in order to improve a song submitted by another writer, and the result was "It's My Party", a big hit for Lesley Gore. Schroeder and Gold tossed a coin as to whose name should go on the record, and Gold "won". The song appeared on the 1959 compilation 50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be Wrong and the 2002 career retrospective ELV1S: 30#1 Hits. == Recording == "A Big Hunk o' Love", a hard, driving rocker, was recorded at Elvis' first and only session during his two years of Army service. The session took place on June 10, 1958, in Nashville, Tennessee. It was the first session that did not include guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, who had both worked with Elvis since his first recordings for Sam Phillips at the Memphis Recording Service, which later became known as Sun Studios. The recording featured Elvis' drummer D.J. Fontana and backing vocalists the Jordanaires, who would continue to work with Elvis until Elvis' appearance at the Hilton in Las Vegas. The rest of the musicians were noted Nashville session men, such as guitarist Hank Garland on a Gibson Byrdland guitar, Floyd Cramer on piano, Bob Moore on double bass, and Buddy Harman and D.J. Fontana on drums. The song was recorded in four takes, the released version is actually spliced from takes three and four. ==Personnel== *Elvis Presley - lead vocals, rhythm guitar *Chet Atkins – rhythm guitar *Hank Garland - lead guitar *Bob Moore - double bass *D.J. Fontana, Buddy Harman - drums *Floyd Cramer - piano *Steve Sholes - producer *Bob Ferris - engineer == Release and chart performance == RCA Victor had paired "A Big Hunk o' Love" for release as a single with "My Wish Came True" as the B-side in both the United States and England. When the single was released on June 23, it was the third release to come from Elvis' army session after "I Got Stung" on October 21, 1958, and "I Need Your Love Tonight" b/w "(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I" on March 10, 1959. The A-side spent two weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 while the B-side peaked at No. 12. The single was less successful on the Cashbox Top 100 with the A-side peaking at No. 2 and the B-side at No. 23. On the UK Singles Chart the A-side peaked at No. 4, while the B-side did not appear on the chart. The A-side also peaked at No. 10 on Billboard magazine's R&B; Singles chart. Presley's next single was another Aaron Schroeder co-composition, "Stuck on You". "A Big Hunk o' Love" was the first of four of Schroeder's songs that became No. 1 hits for Presley. "A Big Hunk o' Love" b/w "My Wish Came True" was Presley's last commercially released Canadian 78 RPM. It was Elvis' first single to not receive a 78 RPM pressing in the United States. == Single track listings == == See also == *List of Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles of 1959 == References == Category:1959 singles Category:Elvis Presley songs Category:RCA Records singles Category:Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles Category:Songs written by Aaron Schroeder Category:1959 songs Category:RCA Victor singles Category:Songs written by Sid Wyche
60578215	A Big Mooncake for Little Star	A Big Mooncake for Little Star is a 2018 picture book written and illustrated by Grace Lin. The story is about Little Star gradually eating the mooncake that her mother has baked. The book was a departure for Lin both thematically and in her use of illustrative style. The book was well reviewed and was awarded a Caldecott Honor. The illustrations feature heavy use of black and rely on both the pictures and words to convey the story and its themes. == Plot == As the book opens Little Star's mother has just finished making a "Big mooncake" and asks the young girl to not touch it. After awaking in the middle of the night, Little Star forgets what her mother had asked of her and takes a small bite and then runs back to bed. This is repeated each night with the mooncake getting smaller and smaller, until Little Star's mother discovers what's happened. The book ends with the two baking a new mooncake. == Background and publication == The book was written to celebrate Lin's "favorite Asian holiday", the Mid-Autumn Festival (what Lin calls the Autumn Moon Festival). She wanted a story for the festival to tell her three-year-old daughter after they had exhausted traditional tales, such as those about the Moon rabbit, and her daughter demanded more. The story was then inspired after her daughter ate all the mooncakes for the year and learned that there would be no more until next year. With the book, Lin was responding to her despair after the 2016 United States presidential election and an art exhibit about the Americana of Robert McCloskey she had taken her daughter to. In the exhibit Lin noticed that there was no Asian representation for her daughter to see and then further thought about Coles Phillips' illustrations where the characters blend into the background, which also lacked Asian characters. Little Star was inspired by Lin's daughter and also created to be an example of the Asian representation Lin had felt was missing. The book was published on August 28, 2018 by Little, Brown and Company. == Writing and illustrations == For Lin, this book represented a change in theme from examining her Asian heritage to claiming her American identity. A Big Mooncake for Little Star is about the phases of the moon and represented a new illustrative style for Lin who had previously illustrated her chapter books like Where the Mountain Meets the Moon with block print. In this book, Lin used gouache on watercolor paper. Black plays an important role in the book's illustrations, contributing to the nighttime sky theme. Author Samantha Hunt writing in The New York Times wrote of how "the rich darkness of the book’s pages is cut by the glorious gold of the stars". The food combines with the background to further space imagery with the crumbs of the mooncake become the stars while spilled milk resembles the Milky Way. This reinforces the book's space theme with Little Star's eating of the mooncakes representing the phases of the moon, though this is not directly stated. The heavy use of black also allows for more emphasis on where and how the book's text is placed and helps reinforce the space theme. Lin's writing and illustrations combined to produce a mysterious and slightly irreverent tone in this original fable. The book's mother-daughter relationship gives a reassuring feeling to the reader. Lin was particularly proud of the endpapers and their homage to McClosky's Blueberries for Sal. She also wanted to capture "the same mother-daughter bond, that timeless love of family, that passing along of traditions and skills. Those things that go beyond race and nationality." The book was also compared to Maurice Sendak's In the Night Kitchen. == Reviews and awards == The book was generally well reviewed. It was given a starred review and was named a best book of 2018 by Kirkus Reviews and Publishers Weekly, while The Washington Post named it as a best book of the year. It also received starred reviews from Booklist, with author and editor Ilene Cooper praising the illustrations and Lin's "intriguing characters who come alive through facial expressions", The Horn Book Magazine, and the School Library Journal. The book was a recipient of a 2019 Caldecott Honor for its illustrations. Lin had tried to tune out the chatter around A Big Mooncake for Little Star being a possible Caldecott book. She had thought the odds of a win were unlikely, so she scheduled a massage when the awards were announced as a way to, "feel special when the dream ended." When she hadn't heard anything by mid-morning she thought it wasn't going to happen and so she was surprised when a little while later her phone rang. The Caledcott had been a signal of quality for Lin who had studied illustration at the Rhode Island School of Design in part because of multiple Caldecott winner Chris Van Allsburg's association with the school. The Wall Street Journal noted that this book was part of a "cheerful" set of Caldecott Medal and Honor books. ==References== Category:2018 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Caldecott Honor-winning works Category:Holiday-themed children's books
3319932	A Big Piece of Garbage	"A Big Piece of Garbage" is the eighth episode in the first season of the American animated television series Futurama. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on 11 May 1999. The episode was written by Lewis Morton and directed by Susie Dietter. Ron Popeil guest stars in this episode as himself. Nancy Cartwright also has a brief cameo as a Bart Simpson doll. Much of the episode is a spoof of the 1998 film Armageddon; however, instead of Earth being threatened by an asteroid, it is threatened by a giant ball of garbage. ==Plot== Professor Farnsworth invites the crew of Planet Express to join him at the Academy of Inventors' annual symposium, where inventors display their latest creations. He will be presenting his invention, the Deathclock, which displays the date of a person's death after that person's finger is stuck into the machine. At the symposium, the crew encounter one of Farnsworth's former students, Professor Ogden Wernstrom. When he was still a student, Wernstrom received an A-minus on a pop quiz and vowed revenge, even if it took him 100 years. Just over 99 years have passed, so Farnsworth considers himself to be essentially in the clear. Wernstrom presents his invention, a reverse SCUBA suit that allows fish to breathe water while walking about on land, demonstrated by his fish, named Cinnamon. He then taunts Farnsworth over his invention from the previous year—the Deathclock. Mortified that he had previously presented the device and forgotten about it, Farnsworth hastily begins drawing on a napkin. He presents the drawing, which depicts both a Smelloscope, a device that allows people to smell distant cosmic objects, and a doodle of himself as a cowboy. As the audience laughs, he sweats and wipes the napkin on his head by accident, blurring the picture. Wernstrom announces that the invention deserves "the worst grade imaginable: an A-minus-minus." Back at Planet Express, Farnsworth invites everybody to see the Smelloscope that he had constructed last year and also forgotten about. Fry begins smelling Jupiter, Saturn, and other objects around the solar system and quickly discovers the smelliest object in the universe. After calculating its trajectory, Farnsworth announces that the object will collide with New New York City in 72 hours, reducing it to a "stinky crater" (Bender immediately starts looting at this news). After some research, they find a video that reveals the object to be a giant ball of garbage from Old New York, launched into space from a mob-obtained rocket in 2052. After warning Mayor Poopenmayer, a plan is hatched to destroy the garbage ball. The Planet Express crew (being the only ones who will take on such a suicidal mission) is sent on a mission to plant a bomb on a fault line next to coffee areas and deposits of AOL floppy disks on the ball. Farnsworth also reminds them that if it blew up any time later, the explosion would cause garbage to rain across the entire Earth, killing millions. Then, once activated, the bomb will be set to allow the crew twenty-five minutes to escape. When the crew lands on the ball, Fry is amazed by all of the 20th-century items on the ball, including a Beanie Baby, a Mister Spock collectors plate, and Bart Simpson dolls, but Leela reminds Fry that these things were garbage, which is why they are in the garbage ball in the first place. Unfortunately, after starting the bomb, they find out the Professor put the bomb's countdown display in upside down, and it actually only allows 52 seconds. The crew panics, and Bender throws the bomb into space to save them, where it explodes harmlessly. The crew returns to Earth in shame. The Mayor then sends for Wernstrom for help. Wernstrom demands tenure, a grant, and five research assistants, at least three of whom must be Chinese. When the mayor agrees to his conditions, Wernstrom reveals that he has no plan, declares that he is set for life, and leaves. In a last-ditch effort to redeem himself, Farnsworth comes up with a second plan to save the city: launching a second ball of garbage to bounce against the first one and sending it flying into the sun without smashing to bits. The Mayor exclaims that there has not been garbage in New New York for 500 years, so there is no way to make such a ball. Fry seizes the moment and demonstrates how to make garbage. An announcement is made to tell the city to throw away everything. The city quickly generates a second ball of garbage, which is fired at the first garbage ball. The rocket flies into the air and hits the other garbage ball, which first slingshots around planets, then sending it into the sun, while the new ball flies out of the solar system. For saving the city from the garbage ball, Professor Farnsworth is given the inventor's award, which was confiscated from Wernstrom as punishment for him being a jackass. Wernstrom comments "I will get you for this Farnsworth, even if it takes another 100 years!" The others quickly dismiss Leela's concerns that the new garbage ball will return and destroy a future generation. Professor Farnsworth replies that it will not be for hundreds of years, presumably by the year 4000, prompting Fry to say "That's the 20th Century spirit!" Over the closing credits, the song "We'll Meet Again" plays instead of the standard Futurama theme. ==Cultural references== The plot of the episode is a reference to the 1998 film Armageddon, in which a group of astronauts attempt to destroy an asteroid heading towards Earth with a warhead. It also references Mobro 4000, a garbage barge that originated in New York and was rejected from multiple ports in 1987. The garbage ball contains Bart Simpson dolls that utter Bart's catchphrase "eat my shorts" to which Bender does, and later he would respond "mmm...shorts" the same way Homer Simpson does when he gets hungry. ==Reception== Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A−, stating, "More than anything else, 'A Big Piece Of Garbage' gives a taste of what’s to come. Other episodes will have more challenging, mind-boggling plots, and still others will find ways to move us more deeply than we thought possible from such a silly, weird little show. But this half hour is proof that the show can tell big, legitimately exciting (if utterly ridiculous) adventure stories without breaking a sweat." This episode was nominated for an Emmy award in 1999 for Best Animated Program (For Programming One Hour or Less)". However, it lost to the King of the Hill episode "And They Call It Bobby Love". ==References== ==External links== * "A Big Piece of Garbage" at The New York Times Movies * * "A Big Piece of Garbage" at the Infosphere, the Futurama Wiki * Episode transcript at IMSDb Category:Futurama (season 1) episodes Category:1999 American television episodes
44754997	A Big She-Bear	A Big She-Bear (The story of mountains with a prologue and an epilogue) is a 2013 Georgian novel by author Miho Mosulishvili. ==Logline== A little boy – Vache – is afraid that the village governor (administrative head) Ahab and his team might kill a big she-bear, as the latter is a symbol of the sin committed by the villagers: Ahab promised to marry Vache’s mother Lela and deceived her. The woman, abandoned and criticized by the villagers, committed suicide. ==Outline== The inhabitants of a village located in the mountains of South Caucasus struggle with a big She-Bear.

2317299	A Bigger Bang	A Bigger Bang is the 22nd British and 24th American studio album by the English rock band the Rolling Stones, released through Virgin Records on 6 September 2005. It is their most recent studio album of original compositions to date, though a follow-up has been long promised. It is also their last album of original material recorded with Charlie Watts on drums before his death in 2021. Unlike their prior effort eight years before, the sprawling and eclectic Bridges to Babylon, which had a bewildering array of producers, musical styles, and guest musicians, the Stones set out to make a basic, hard rock album that hearkened back to their 1960–70s heyday. A single producer, Don Was, was brought in to co-produce the album alongside the band's principal songwriting and production team of vocalist Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. Joining the two were band members Ronnie Wood on guitar and Charlie Watts on drums, contract players Darryl Jones on bass and Chuck Leavell on keyboards, and multi-instrumentalist Matt Clifford. Most of the basic tracks were recorded as a simple trio of Jagger, Richards, and Watts, with overdubs added later by other players. The back-to-basics method of recording the album paid off for the Stones, who saw the album reach number three in the US, number two in the UK, and number one in eleven countries around the world. The lead single, "Streets of Love", failed to chart in the US, but was otherwise successful around the world, reaching number 15 in the UK and top-40 in over a dozen other countries. Two other singles were released to moderate worldwide sales. Reviews of the album were generally favourable; while critics noted that the album was not up to the standards of the Stones classic period, it nonetheless was among the best reviewed of their later albums. The follow-up tour, which lasted two years, would become the highest-grossing tour of all time by its completion. A Martin Scorsese-directed concert film titled Shine a Light documented the tour. ==History== The album used a stripped-down style reminiscent of Some Girls (1978), but with a harder, more contemporary edge. Although initial reports stated that the Stones had "returned to their roots" with the record, the minimal instrumentation, rough mix, tough blues and "garage" rock hybrid bear certain similarities to the style of contemporary artists like the White Stripes and the Black Keys. Many songs were recorded with just the core band of Jagger, Richards and Watts. Ronnie Wood was absent from many sessions, playing on only ten of the sixteen tracks, with only occasional contributions from outside musicians comprising the recording of the album. This is also the first album where Jagger plays bass guitar on some tracks. The Stones said in a statement that the album's title reflects "their fascination with the scientific theory about the origin of the universe." == Writing and recording == Songs for A Bigger Bang were composed by Jagger and Richards in June 2004 at Jagger's chateau in Pocé-sur-Cisse, France. At the château, they learned of Charlie Watts' throat cancer diagnosis and debated about postponing the writing, but ultimately went ahead after determining that Watts was not required to be present until later. As a result of this, Jagger played the drums during early guide track recordings; all but one of these was later rerecorded by Watts, but Jagger's beat remained. Jagger and Richards shared bass and guitar parts between them. The album was produced by Don Was and the sound engineering was done by Krish Sharma. Mixing for the album was performed by Jack Joseph Puig and Dave Sardy. ==Release and reception== The first single, "Streets of Love"/"Rough Justice", reached No. 15 in the UK singles chart, while A Bigger Bang peaked at No. 2 on the UK charts. Another song, "Sweet Neo Con", was critical of the conservative Christian movement in American politics. In August 2005, the Rolling Stones embarked on the 90-show A Bigger Bang Tour in support of the album. It was met with sold-out tickets at every destination, usually within minutes of going on sale. The tour was extended into 2007 because Richards got hurt falling out of a tree in Fiji and required surgery in New Zealand. The tour concluded in August 2007 at the O2 Arena in London. Critical reaction was mostly positive. The aggregate score of the album by Metacritic was rated 73 out of 100, categorizing the reviews as "generally favourable". A Bigger Bang was touted as the best Rolling Stones album in years. Nevertheless, all of the Stones albums since 1989's Steel Wheels had been similarly lauded, and many critics and fans felt that the Stones had yet to record a late-period album truly up to their high standards. It was chosen as one of Amazon.com's Top 100 Editor's Picks of 2005, and ranked the second-best album of the year by Rolling Stone magazine, behind rapper Kanye West's Late Registration. A review by the Associated Press referred to the album as "a winner" that "hammers home the fact that The Rolling Stones still have 'it'". A Bigger Bang went platinum in the US and Germany, and gold in Japan. According to Nielsen SoundScan it sold 546,000 copies in the US,Christman, Ed, et al. "Future Shock" . Billboard. 23 January 2010 and as of 31 March 2006, 2.4 million copies worldwide according to EMI. In 2009, A Bigger Bang was reissued by Universal Music Group. The US re- release was handled by Interscope Records, while Polydor Records handled all other territories. == Usage in other media == Songs from A Bigger Bang have seen commercial use in television, including multiple appearances in Days of Our Lives. The 12th Track "Laugh, I Nearly Died", was used in the Season One episode of Supernatural "Bloody Mary" at the end of the episode where Sam sees a vision of his dead girlfriend Jessica at the side of the street. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from album liner notes.

4677724	A Bigger Bang Tour	A Bigger Bang was a worldwide concert tour by the Rolling Stones which took place between August 2005 and August 2007, in support of their album A Bigger Bang. At the time, it was the highest grossing tour of all time, earning $558,255,524. It has since been surpassed by U2's 2009–11 U2 360 Tour, placing second . The tour was chronicled on the video release The Biggest Bang, compiling full performances, several recordings from shows and documentaries. ==History== In 2005, the Stones announced plans for another world tour starting 21 August at a press conference and a mini concert at the Juilliard School in New York City. The A Bigger Bang Tour was expected to include dates throughout the United States and Canada before going to South America, Asia and Europe. During the Q&A;, Mick Jagger told reporters that it would not necessarily be their last tour. All rehearsals for the tour took place in Toronto, Ontario, at the midtown private school Greenwood College School; for the full stage rehearsals, a hangar at Pearson International Airport was rented. In keeping with tradition, the Rolling Stones performed a surprise club show on 10 August 2005 at the Phoenix Concert Theatre before an audience of 1,000, each only paying $10 (the Phoenix's regular cover charge). The tour had its official start on 21 August 2005 with two shows at historic Fenway Park in Boston. The Stones' huge stage caused extensive damage to the outfield, so that approximately 40,000 square feet (4,000 m2) of sod had to be brought in to repair it, and a subsequent baseball game held at the park three days later had to be pushed back an hour to give the grounds crew more time to complete the repairs.Associated Press. "Comerica Park needs new moss after Stones concert". USA Today. 4 September 2005. At the end of 2005, it was announced by tour producer Michael Cohl that the A Bigger Bang Tour had grossed a record-shattering $162 million since opening at Fenway Park. This broke the previous North American record, held by the Stones themselves for their own 1994/1995 Voodoo Lounge Tour, which grossed approximately $120 million. In terms of revenue, the A Bigger Bang Tour was the largest tour in North America. The second largest was the Stones' 1997/1998 Bridges to Babylon Tour. On 1 February 2006, the Stones played their first concert at the Baltimore Arena since 1969, the second smallest venue they played for the entire tour. Their most intimate performance, save the surprise Phoenix show in Toronto, was in Radio City Music Hall on 14 March 2006, in a private concert for supporters of the Robin Hood Foundation. This benefit concert was their only performance at the venue to date. Other intimate venues the Stones played during the tour was the Beacon Theatre in New York City. On 28 August 2005, the Rolling Stones performed at Frank Clair Stadium in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, their first performance in Ottawa since a performance at the Ottawa Auditorium 40 years earlier on 24 April 1965. While on the American leg of the tour, on 5 February 2006 the Stones played "Start Me Up", "Rough Justice" and "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" at the halftime show of Super Bowl XL in Detroit. Before performing "Satisfaction", Jagger made an uncharacteristic comment on their longevity: "This one we could've done for Super Bowl I." Jagger was asked to leave out two sexually suggestive lyrics. The audio on his microphone was lowered twice for the two requested omissions, but Jagger still sang those lyrics. The outstanding scale of the tour was realised on 18 February 2006 when the Stones played a one-night concert on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The free concert was broadcast on television and broke several records as the largest rock concert of all time. There were a reported two million people present on the beach and crowding subsequent streets. A special bridge was constructed for the band to cross from the stage to the hotel safely. Three days after the monstrous event, U2 played in São Paulo, and clearly affected by the huge night, ended their concert with the words: "I can't get no satisfaction!". While the Guinness Book of World Records states the largest free concert ever was given in the same spot in 1994 by Rod Stewart, to 3.5 million people, that figure includes everyone who was on Copacabana Beach for fireworks and New Year's Eve celebrations, not just for that concert. This show was recorded for exhibition on digital movie screens across the United States via Regal Cinemas and heard live on XM Radio. Additionally, the show was shown live on AOL Music in partnership with Network Live. The Stones arrived on 8 April in the People's Republic of China for their first-ever performance in the world's most populous country (performances planned in 2003 for the Licks Tour were canceled due to the SARS epidemic). The Chinese authorities requested that the group not perform "Brown Sugar", "Honky Tonk Women", "Beast of Burden", and "Let's Spend the Night Together", as they were considered to be "too suggestive." The Biggest Bang, a four-disc concert DVD collection with several shows from the band's 2005–2006 legs of this tour, was released in June 2007. "A Bigger Bang: Live on Copacabana Beach", a double CD / triple LP / Blu-ray / double DVD live album, was released on July 9, 2021. After their 18 April 2006 performance in Wellington, New Zealand, the Rolling Stones took a one-month break before embarking on the European leg of their A Bigger Bang Tour. Mick Jagger remained in New Zealand to film a cameo in the sitcom The Knights of Prosperity, while Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood went to Fiji for two weeks with their wives. During the vacation, Richards fell from a tree. After suffering a concussion, he was rushed back to Ascot Private Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand, for further observation. Although reports claimed he had been released two days later, it was soon confirmed by the hospital he underwent brain surgery on 5 May to relieve a blood clot that had gathered behind his skull. The BBC reported that upon discharge, Richards profusely thanked the hospital staff for his care. On 15 May, Britain's The Independent newspaper said that the injury meant up to six shows could be pulled from the start of the band's European tour at an estimated cost of £1 million a show. The A Bigger Bang Tour restarted in Milan, Italy on 11 July 2006 at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, with Jagger singing an entire Italian translation of "As Tears Go By" and Richards having made a full recovery; four of the first fifteen dates were rescheduled for later in the summer, with the rest of the dates taking place in the summer of 2007. As well as the first fifteen dates, two more dates were postponed due to Jagger contracting laryngitis. The only previous show cancelled was one in Dublin, due to complications with the promoter. Due to delays with construction, the two shows set to be at Wembley Stadium were moved to Twickenham Stadium, London. To promote this European leg of the A Bigger Bang Tour, there were plans to release the new track "Biggest Mistake" from the A Bigger Bang album. In mid-August 2007, several media sources reported that the band would quit touring at the end of their tour, and the last concert on the tour, in London on 26 August, would be their last gig ever. Less than a week later, in an interview with The Sun newspaper, Wood said the band had no plans to quit. and Jagger also stated "I'm sure the Rolling Stones will do more things and more records and more tours." The tour concluded with a record total gross of $558,255,524. This surpassed the previous record of $377 million earned by U2 for their successful Vertigo Tour. The Stones also hold the record for third and fourth highest grossing tours with the Voodoo Lounge Tour and Bridges to Babylon Tour. The official logo for the tour was the "Chippy Tongue"—an exploding re-design of the tongue and lips logo. ==The show== There were five different ticket options at each concert in the USA: Gold Seating $100, Diamond Seating $350, Premium Seating $175, General Admission $100 and Side Seating $50. In the United Kingdom, the price levels were £40, £60, £90, £150 and £340. Tickets had been seen on eBay for up to $4000. Hundreds of tickets remained unsold at some of the band's British shows, such as the show at Hampden Park, Glasgow, though the show at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff was a sell out. The first concert at Fenway Park also saw California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger charge 36 Republican donors US$100,000 each to view the show with him in his VIP box. Jagger quipped about Schwarzenegger, "Apparently he's been fundraising outside, selling bootleg T-shirts and scalping tickets", to the crowd, with Richards adding, "Hey, Arnold, don't forget our cut on the T-shirts." The A Bigger Bang Tour stage was designed by Mark Fisher. Production design was by Fisher, Charlie Watts, Mick Jagger and Patrick Woodroffe. The show included state-of- the-art electronics that presented visual screen shots of the Stones Tongue and live footage. The stage was 25 m (84 ft) tall. The multi-level construction included balconies behind the stage with accommodation for 400 audience. As on the Bridges to Babylon and Licks tours, the band played part of the set on a 'B' stage in the center of the field. A section of the stage detached itself and rolled the entire band along a catwalk, creating an "island" B stage in the middle of the stadium. Unusual stage designs in and of themselves have been a feature since Rolling Stones Tour of the Americas '75. The introduction featured fireworks and computer-generated graphics representing the literal Big Bang. The four band members' faces hazily appear, and further graphics depicting fast travel through a city's streets before Keith Richards appeared on the screen to the sound of the band's opening song (mainly "Start Me Up" or "Jumpin' Jack Flash" although a handful of other numbers opened shows on the tour). During the concerts, one large central screen played live footage of the various band members, predominantly Jagger. Either side of the main screen, there were two sets of lighting effect panels that combine with the main screen to produce visual effects at various points in the show. At stadium gigs, during "Sympathy for the Devil", huge flames were sent into the air above the stage. During the 1970s, this song only made sporadic live appearances, though is captured on 1977's Love You Live. However, since 1989's Steel Wheels Tour, "Sympathy for the Devil" has become a setlist mainstay and a vehicle for the show's most elaborate effects. On Saturday 11 November 2006, Mick Jagger's father, Joe Jagger, died of pneumonia at age ninety-three in Kingston upon Thames near London. Jagger flew to Britain the day before to see his father one last time before returning to Las Vegas the same day, where he was to perform on Saturday night. The show went ahead as scheduled. ==Personnel== Rolling Stones *Mick Jagger – lead vocals, guitars, harmonica, keyboards *Keith Richards – rhythm guitars, backing vocals *Ronnie Wood – lead guitar *Charlie Watts – drums Additional musicians *Darryl Jones – bass *Chuck Leavell – keyboards, backing vocals *Bernard Fowler – backing vocals *Lisa Fischer – backing vocals, percussion *Blondie Chaplin – backing vocals, acoustic guitar *Bobby Keys – saxophone *Tim Ries – saxophone, keyboards *Michael Davis – trombone *Kent Smith – trumpet ==Set lists== The set list played at the concerts changed at every destination and included new and old songs, but mostly centred around the same numbers. Altogether 80 different songs were played. At almost every destination, the opening song switched between "Jumpin' Jack Flash", "Start Me Up", "It's Only Rock 'n' Roll", and "Paint It Black"; the closing numbers were either "(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" or "Brown Sugar." A selection of new material was frequent as well as two songs sung by guitarist Keith Richards. New tracks included: "Rough Justice", "Infamy", "This Place Is Empty", "It Won't Take Long", "Rain Fall Down", "Streets of Love", "Back of My Hand" and "Oh No, Not You Again." The set list for the final show in The O2 in London, England, on 26 August – the last concert of the tour – was the following: #"Start Me Up" #"You Got Me Rocking" #"Rough Justice" #"Ain't Too Proud To Beg" #"She Was Hot" #"You Can't Always Get What You Want" #"Can't You Hear Me Knocking" #"I'll Go Crazy" #"Tumbling Dice" #"You Got the Silver" #"Wanna Hold You" #"Miss You" #"It's Only Rock 'n Roll (But I Like It)" #"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction" #"Honky Tonk Women" #"Sympathy for the Devil" #"Paint It Black" #"Jumpin' Jack Flash" #"Brown Sugar" According to Setlist.fm, these were the most frequently performed songs on the tour: *Jumpin' Jack Flash: 147 times *Tumbling Dice: 147 times *Start Me Up: 147 times *(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction: 147 times *Sympathy for the Devil: 146 times *Brown Sugar: 146 times *Honky Tonk Women: 144 times *Rough Justice: 127 times *It's Only Rock and Roll (But I Like It): 125 times *Miss You: 121 times ==Support acts== Artists playing as an introduction to the Stones at various destinations included Toots & the Maytals, Lifehouse, The Black Eyed Peas, Alice Cooper, Maroon 5, Kanye West, Beck, Pearl Jam, The Smashing Pumpkins, Alanis Morissette, Christina Aguilera, Mötley Crüe, Metallica, Brooks & Dunn, Bonnie Raitt, Trey Anastasio, Dave Matthews Band, Living Colour, The Living End, Joss Stone, Nickelback, Buddy Guy, The Charlatans, Regina, Feeder, the John Mayer Trio, Wilco, Richie Kotzen and Our Lady Peace. Dominican artist Juan Luis Guerra opened the San Juan, Puerto Rico, show, making him the only Merengue artist that has ever opened for the Stones. This opening act "garnered the best reception ever seen at a Stones show", as reported by It's Only Rock and Roll, the Rolling Stones Fan Club of Europe. For the Halifax, Nova Scotia, show acts included Halifax natives Sloan, well known rap artist Kanye West and Alice Cooper. Black Rebel Motorcycle Club opened the shows in Wichita and Missoula. Three Days Grace opened both concerts in Regina. Blue October opened for them in Nampa, Idaho. The two shows in San Francisco were supported by Metallica, who said they were "honoured" to break a seventeen-year span of not performing an opening show, in order to open for the Stones. The Stones acknowledged this gesture by giving them 75 minutes per show, instead of the usual 45 to 60 minutes. They were also Metallica's only dates that year as they had planned to take 2005 off from touring. Guns N' Roses were scheduled to open for the Stones for two dates in Germany, whilst on one of their Chinese Democracy Tour pre-legs. However, due to Keith Richards' fall from a tree, the shows were cancelled. Van Morrison was the supporting act in Nijmegen, Netherlands, as well as in Oakland, California. Due to heavy rain his amps, etc. were getting wet, so he was forced to stop after two songs. ==Tour dates== Date City Country Venue Opening act North America 10 August 2005 Toronto Canada Phoenix Concert Theatre The Trews 21 August 2005 Boston United States Fenway Park Black Eyed Peas 23 August 2005 26 August 2005 East Hartford Rentschler Field Maroon 5 28 August 2005 Ottawa Canada Frank Clair Stadium Les Trois Accords Our Lady Peace 31 August 2005 Detroit United States Comerica Park Maroon 5 3 September 2005 Moncton Canada Magnetic Hill Concert Site Maroon 5 The Tragically Hip Les Trois Accords Our Lady Peace 6 September 2005 St. Paul United States Xcel Energy Center Buddy Guy 8 September 2005 Milwaukee Bradley Center 10 September 2005 Chicago Soldier Field Los Lonely Boys The Blues Brothers The Have Love Will Travel Revue 13 September 2005 New York City Madison Square Garden Alanis Morissette 15 September 2005 East Rutherford Giants Stadium 17 September 2005 Albany Pepsi Arena 24 September 2005 Columbus Nationwide Arena Beck 26 September 2005 Toronto Canada Rogers Centre 28 September 2005 Pittsburgh United States PNC Park Pearl Jam 1 October 2005 Hershey Hersheypark Stadium Beck 3 October 2005 Washington, D.C.

It was released in the United States in 1993 by Sugar Hill Records and re-released in SACD format with the originally intended track sequencing in 2004 by Koch Records. The title of the album comes from a line in the opening verse of "Paint the Town Beige": :I gave up the fast lane for a blacktop country road :Just burned out on all that talk about the mother lode, :I traded for a songbird and a bigger piece of sky :When I miss the good old days I can't imagine why.

26252280	A Bigger Splash	A Bigger Splash is a large pop art painting by British artist David Hockney. Measuring by , it depicts a swimming pool beside a modern house, disturbed by a large splash of water created by an unseen figure who has apparently just jumped in from a diving board. It was painted in California between April and June 1967, when Hockney was teaching at the University of California, Berkeley. Jack Hazan's fictionalised 1973 biopic, A Bigger Splash, concentrating on the breakup of Hockney's relationship with Peter Schlesinger, was named after the painting. Luca Guadagnino's 2015 film A Bigger Splash (a loose remake of La Piscine) was also named after the painting. == Description == A Bigger Splash shows a typical California day – warm and sunny, with a cloudless blue sky. In the background, two palm trees loom over a large single-story house, with flat roof and large sliding glass doors, in front of which an empty director's chair with thin crossed legs stands on a wide pink patio. A shadow under the chair suggests that the sun is high in the sky, around noon. In the foreground, a yellow diving board slants away from lower right corner, leading the viewer's gaze towards the centre of a large swimming pool, where water fountains into the air, capturing the moment right after someone has dived in. The diver is not visible, presumably still under the water. The chair lies further back along the same diagonal line. A thickening in the white line atop the building's flat roof emphasizes the place where the diver has entered the water.WebMuseum Hockney's composition is based on a photograph of a swimming pool in a book and an earlier drawing by Hockney of Californian buildings. It was created with meticulous care, simplified, but enlarging his earlier paintings entitled A Little Splash (1966) and The Splash (1966) (both are held in private collections; the latter was sold for £2.6 million in 2006Hockney painting sells for £2.6m, BBC News, 22 June 2006The Splash, Sotheby's, 21 June 2006 and for £23.1 million in 2020, both times by auction at Sotheby's in London). The canvas – almost a perfect square – is dominated by the strong vertical and horizontal lines of the trees, the building, and the edge of the pool; it is divided evenly into the sky, building and patio in the upper half, and the pool and diving board in the lower half. The rectilinear composition is broken by the oblique thrust of the diving board. The calmness of the overall composition contrasts with the violent explosion of water caused by diver. Hockney has expressed his pleasure at taking two weeks to paint a moment that lasted two seconds.Tate catalogue, quoting David Hockney by David Hockney In a March 2009 interview for the Tate, to the question "Who jumped into the pool?" Hockney answers: "I don't know actually. It was done from a photograph of a splash. That I haven't taken, but that's what it's commenting on. The stillness of an image. (...) Most of the painting was spent on the splash and the splash lasts two seconds and the building is permanent there. That's what it's about actually. You have to look in at the details."Tate: The archive twitter with David Hockney == Composition == The painting was made using acrylic Liquitex on a white cotton duck canvas, with no underdrawing. Hockney uses a limited palette – cobalt blue, ultramarine blue, raw sienna, burnt sienna, raw umber, Hooker's green, Naples yellow and titanium white – applied either mixed together or as tints. Apart from the splash, the painting was finished very evenly and flat with a paint roller, in two or three layers, with the few details – tree, grass, chair, reflections – overpainted. The central splash was heavily worked over a period of about two weeks using a variety of small brushes. A wide border and central narrow stripe at the pool's edge are left unpainted. The border creates an effect like a Polaroid photograph. The painting has been viewed as a critical link in Hockney's ruminations on time between his earlier Picture Emphasising Stillness and his later "joiners" portraits, created by collaging many photographs of the same subject taken over a period of hours.David Hockney, Paul Melia, Manchester University Press, 1995, == Sale history == The Marquess of Dufferin and Ava bought the finished work from John Kasmin's gallery in 1968, and sold it to the Tate in 1981. ==Notes== ==References== *Full catalogue entry from The Tate *A Bigger Splash, WebMuseum *Hockney, David: A Bigger Splash (1967), The Independent, 11 May 2007 ==External links== *British artist David Hockney on A Bigger Splash, BBC Nottingham, 30 November 2009 (video) Category:Pop art Category:1967 paintings Category:Paintings by David Hockney Category:Collection of the Tate galleries Category:Water in art Category:California in art
53337151	A Bigger Splash (1973 film)	A Bigger Splash is a 1973 British biographical documentary film about David Hockney's lingering breakup with his then-partner Peter Schlesinger, from 1970 to 1973. Directed by Jack Hazan and edited by David Mingay, it has music by Patrick Gowers. Featuring many of Hockney's circle, it includes designers Celia Birtwell and Ossie Clark, artist Patrick Procktor, gallery owner John Kasmin and museum curator Henry Geldzahler. == Analysis == It is a fly-on-the- wall documentary, intercut with fictionalised and fantasy elements. It was a groundbreaking production at the time and remains notable for its treatment of gay themes and its insights into Hockney's life and work. The film takes its title from the 1967 painting A Bigger Splash, perhaps Hockney's best-known Californian swimming pool picture and his best-known artwork at all. Hockney was initially shocked by its intimacy but later changed his mind. == Critical reception and legacy== A Bigger Splash was a critical and commercial success upon its release. It was praised for its honesty, insight, and originality. The film was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Documentary Film in 1974. It is considered a landmark film in the history of documentary filmmaking. It was one of the first films to explore gay themes in a frank and open way, and it helped to break down the stigma surrounding homosexuality. The film is also notable for its innovative use of documentary techniques, such as the use of fictionalised and fantasy elements. A Bigger Splash has been praised by filmmakers and critics alike. Martin Scorsese called it "a masterpiece" and "one of the most important films ever made about the creative process." The film has also been cited as an influence by filmmakers such as Gus Van Sant and Todd Haynes. == Home Video == A Bigger Splash was released on DVD and Blu- ray by Criterion. ==See also== * Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures), 1972 Hockney painting featured in the film. == References == ==External links== * * Category:1974 films Category:1974 documentary films Category:1970s avant-garde and experimental films Category:1970s biographical films Category:1973 LGBT-related films Category:1973 films Category:British avant-garde and experimental films Category:British biographical films Category:David Hockney Category:Documentary films about gay men Category:Documentary films about painters Category:1970s English-language films Category:1970s British films Category:British LGBT-related documentary films
47134700	A Bigger Splash (2015 film)	A Bigger Splash is a 2015 psychological drama film directed by Luca Guadagnino and with a screenplay by David Kajganich from a story by Alain Page. Starring Tilda Swinton, Matthias Schoenaerts, Ralph Fiennes, and Dakota Johnson, the film is loosely based on the 1969 Jacques Deray film La Piscine and named after the 1967 David Hockney painting of the same name. It is the second instalment in Guadagnino's self-described Desire trilogy, following I Am Love (2009) and preceding Call Me by Your Name (2017). It competed for the Golden Lion at the 72nd Venice International Film Festival. == Plot == In an isolated villa on the small Italian island of Pantelleria, world-famous rock singer Marianne Lane is on holiday with her filmmaker lover Paul De Smedt. She is recovering from surgery and has lost her voice, communicating only by signs and occasional whispers. He is in recovery from alcohol addiction and a suicide attempt. Neither speaks Italian and their togetherness is interrupted by uninvited visitors. Harry Hawkes is an extroverted music producer who was Marianne's lover until he passed her on to his protégé, Paul. With him is Penelope "Pen" Lanier, a previously unknown daughter of his who says she is 22. Moving into the villa, Harry starts inviting friends around as if it were his home and taking everybody out to various sights and festivities. His arrogant manner bores Pen and annoys Paul, but Marianne starts falling under his spell again; however, when Harry and Marianne begin to become intimate, Marianne stops Harry. She tells him that she does love him, but that she cannot be with him and that she is with Paul. The sultry Pen then makes a play for the unhappy Paul; it is not shown, but implied, that Paul succumbs to Pen's overtures. After drinking on his own, Harry comes back very late and starts a fight with Paul beside the pool. Both fall in, and the fight continues. Paul holds Harry underwater to subdue him, but Harry drowns. Realising his mistake, Paul pulls Harry to the surface and attempts to resuscitate him, but is unsuccessful and leaves Harry to drift to the bottom of the pool. In the morning, his corpse is seen by the maid, who calls the police. They have more urgent business with refugees landing from North Africa, some floating ashore dead, but take the occupants of the villa in for questioning. Marianne convinces them with the truth that she was asleep, and suggests that the murderer was an intruder. Paul lies, saying he went to bed before the time of death, and is believed. Pen eventually reveals that she can speak perfect Italian, but chose to let her hosts struggle, and her passport reveals that she is only 17. Paul is concerned that Pen may have witnessed his fight with Harry in the pool, but is unable to determine how much she knows, if anything. Paul tearfully admits to Marianne that he killed Harry but tried to save him. At the airport, as Pen is about to fly out, she tells Paul and Marianne something that refers to something Marianne once said to Harry. Visibly disturbed, Marianne slaps Pen. Pen maintains her composure until she is shown boarding the plane in tears unseen by Marianne and Paul who depart in their car. On the ride back to the villa, they are stopped by the police. It is the investigating officer, but rather than pursuing the case he reveals himself to be a fan of Marianne and wants her to autograph a CD. She obliges and returns to the car where she and Paul share their relief and drive away. ==Cast== * Tilda Swinton as Marianne Lane * Matthias Schoenaerts as Paul De Smedt * Ralph Fiennes as Harry Hawkes * Dakota Johnson as Penelope "Pen" Lanier * Lily McMenamy as Sylvie * Aurore Clément as Mireille * Elena Bucci as Clara * Corrado Guzzanti as Maresciallo dei Carabinieri ==Marketing== The first promo still of A Bigger Splash featuring Matthias Schoenaerts, Tilda Swinton, Dakota Johnson and Ralph Fiennes was released on 27 July 2015.

69610272	A Bilingual Field Guide to the Frogs of Zululand	A Bilingual Field Guide to the Frogs of Zululand (or Isiqondiso Sasefilidini Esindimimbili Ngamaxoxo AkwelaKwaZulu in IsiZulu) is a field guide meant to help readers identify frogs found in the Zululand region of South Africa's KwaZulu-Natal province and to dispel misconceptions about frogs among AmaZulu of the region. This book is written in English and by co-authors Doctors Fortunate M. Phaka, Edward C. Netherlands, Donnavan J.D. Kruger, and Professor Louis H. du Preez from the North-West University. Translation of the text from English to IsiZulu were done by Manzo Khulu. The South African National Biodiversity Institute published the book as part of their Suricata range of peer-reviewed publications meant to be an inclusive platform for all Africans and the continent's biodiversity This book uses the Tête-bêche bookbinding structure; one side of the book has the English titled front cover while the other side has the IsiZulu titled front cover and readers have to flip the book horizontally to switch between either languages. At the start of a frog bio-monitoring project in Zululand by the book's authors and their colleagues, the authors recognised the importance of speaking to local communities about their research in a language that was easily understood in the region, which is IsiZulu. After consultation with Zululand community members to understand their perceptions of frogs, the process of writing the book began on 28 November 2016 and the book was officially launched on 27 November 2017. As a result of this consultation, a review of this book determined that it has taken an a posteriori approach to environmental education and the sharing of educational ecosystem benefits. This book written as part of Fortunate Phaka's Master's degree research, became the first South African field guide for frogs to be written in one of the country's official indigenous languages (IsiZulu) == Spin-offs == A Bilingual Field Guide to the Frogs of Zululand is cited as the motivation behind an initiative to document and share wildlife knowledge in South Africa's indigenous languages as a means of increasing inclusivity in the country's wildlife sector and preserving cultural heritage. The book was used as a case study about how the process of developing environmental education reading materials in indigenous languages contributes to development and intellectualisation of African languages. Another case study based on the book focused on folk taxonomy of the frogs discussed in this book and how it is possible to extend folk taxonomy so that it emulates scientific taxonomy with a comprehensive list of names for each frog species in the region == References == Category:South African books Category:Herpetological literature Category:Bilingual books Category:Frogs of Africa

1812238	A Bill of Divorcement (1932 film)	A Bill of Divorcement is a 1932 American pre-Code drama film directed by George Cukor and starring John Barrymore and Katharine Hepburn in her film debut. It is based on the 1921 British play of the same name, written by Clemence Dane as a reaction to a law passed in Britain in the early 1920s that allowed insanity as grounds for a woman to divorce her husband.A Bill of Divorcement as produced on Broadway at the George M. Cohan Theatre, and moved to the Time Square Theatre, total run October 10, 1921-June 1922; IBDb.com It was the second screen adaptation of the play; the first was a 1922 British silent film also titled A Bill of Divorcement. The film was made again in 1940 by RKO Pictures. == Plot == Middle-aged Englishwoman named Margaret "Meg" Fairfield's family includes her daughter Sydney, Sydney's fiancé Kit Humphreys, fiancé Gray Meredith and husband Hilary, who has been a patient in a mental institution for 15 years. Sydney seems to have inherited Hilary's psychiatric problems. On Christmas Eve, Meg hosts a party in her English manor. Sydney happily discusses her future with Kit, as do Meg and Gray. When the group dedicate their performance of the song "God Bless the Master of This House" to Gray, Hilary's sister Hester objects because she considers Hilary to be the master of the house even though he is psychotic and institutionalized. On Christmas morning, while Meg and Gray are at church, the asylum telephones to inform the family that Hilary has gone missing, and Hester unintentionally reveals to Sydney that insanity runs in the family. The family has blamed Hilary's troubles on shell shock from World War I, but another family member had similar problems in the past. Hester and Sydney discuss Hilary's talent as a composer, and Sydney plays an unfinished sonata on the piano that Hilary had written before going to war. Hilary returns home after having escaped from the asylum. He chats with Sydney but they engage in a heated argument that shows their similarities as sensitive, free-spirited people. When Meg returns from church, she is shocked to find Hilary. She has not loved him for years, is frightened by him and has been counting on her upcoming marriage to Gray, who helped her obtain a divorce based on Hilary's insanity. However, Hilary assumes that Meg will welcome him back. He cannot accept that the marriage has long since ended until his family doctor arrives and admonishes Hilary, telling him in Sydney's presence that his children should not have been born. Sydney then begins contemplating her own plans with Kit. After the doctor tells her that her children would be at risk of inheriting Hilary's mental problems, she breaks her engagement to Kit and sends him away. Hilary vacillates between accepting Meg's love for Gray and pleading with her to change her mind. Meg succumbs to his pressure, but when he sees her talking with Gray, Hilary realizes how much she loves Gray and how miserable she feels. Hilary finally regains his will to do what is best, and he has Sydney send Meg and Gray away. When Sydney returns to Hilary, she tearfully embraces him and they agree that they will live together. They sit together at the piano, cheerfully experimenting with new endings to his sonata. ==Cast== thumb|upright|Katharine Hepburn and David Manners in A Bill of Divorcement *John Barrymore as Hilary Fairfield *Billie Burke as Meg Fairfield *David Manners as Kit Humphreys *Katharine Hepburn as Sydney Fairfield *Paul Cavanagh as Gray Meredith *Henry Stephenson as Dr. Alliot *Gayle Evers as Bassett *Elizabeth Patterson as Aunt Hester Fairfield ==Production== The film was produced by David O.

65750656	A Bill of Divorcement (play)	A Bill of Divorcement is a play by English author Clemence Dane. It was her first play, and her most popular, and was adapted to films of the same name three times, in 1922, 1932, and 1940. ==Synopsis== Though it was premiered in 1921, the play is set in the early 1930s. Margaret Fairfield divorces her husband, who has been in a mental hospital for many years, in order to remarry. Their daughter cares for the father and faces the fact that his mental illness may be hereditary. Although not permitted at the time in Britain, the play imagines a future where divorce is permitted where a spouse is incurably insane. Due to evolving cultural views, divorce was a popular subject in novels and drama of the time.D'Monte, Rebecca. British Theatre and Performance 1900-1950, p. 130 (2015) ==London production== The play was first performed in London on March 14, 1921 at St Martin's Theatre, with Basil Dean as producer, and ran for 402 performances. The cast included Lilian Braithwaite, Malcolm Keen and Meggie Albanesi.Pollack, Rhoda-Gale (14 March 2018).

Broadway producer Charles Dillingham had decided to try producing a serious drama in New York for the next season (instead of his customary musical comedies) and agreed to take it on. In America, the play was premiered at George M. Cohan's Theatre on October 10, 1921. Despite good reviews, audiences were slow to grow. The Cohan theatre had already planned to mount a new show when Divorcement began to grow popular, so the show was moved to the Times Square Theater on November 7. It closed in March 1922, after a total run of 173 performances.Mantle, Burns, ed. The Best Plays of 1921-22, pp. 63-95 (includes extended excerpts from the play)(11 October 1921).

A Billion Hands Concert took place on 5 December 2008 in Mumbai. Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson stated in a press release that, "some people might consider it disrespectful that we are having a concert but hopefully a majority will realise what this is about and what it says."Mumbai hosts first concert after deadly attacks Shankar added that: "as a musician, this is how I speak, how I express the anger within me [...] our entire tour has been changed by these events and even though the structure of the concert may remain the same, emotionally perhaps we are saying a lot more." Farhad Wadia, CEO of E 18, stated in response that: "We are very grateful to both Jethro Tull and Ms. Shankar for agreeing to perform at this concert, in spite of the terror attacks and at their splendid contribution towards the victims of the horrific attacks in Mumbai.

66879156	A Billion Little Lights	A Billion Little Lights is the third studio album by American indie rock band Wild Pink. It was released on February 19, 2021 under Royal Mountain Records. ==Release== On October 7, 2020, Wild Pink announced the release of their third studio album, along with the first single "The Shining But Tropical". In a press release, the band's lead vocalist John Ross explained the single: "It was inspired by Carl Sagan’s Cosmos as well as "If I Needed You" by Townes Van Zandt, this song is named for a grim retirement home in Florida. It’s about somebody who was born sheltered realising how large the world is and how unimportant they are." The second single "You Can Have It Back" was released on November 20, 2020, which also features Ratboys' lead vocalist Julia Steiner. Ross noted the single was the last song written for the album, explaining the single was inspired by Fleetwood Mac. The third single "Oversharers Anonymous" was released on January 14, 2021. Of the single, John Ross said: "This is one of the first songs I wrote for A Billion Little Lights and was inspired, among many things, by Ken Burns’ The West and the book The Earth Is Weeping by Peter Cozzens. Also inspired by a drive on the Taconic Parkway. Recording everyone’s parts on the outro was one of my favorite parts of making this album." On February 16, 2021, Wild Pink released the fourth single "Pacific City". ==Critical reception== A Billion Little Lights was met with "generally favorable" reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 71 based on 8 reviews. Aggregator AnyDecentMusic? gave the release 6.6 out of 10 based on a critical consensus of 7 reviews. Writing for Beats Per Minute, John Amen wrote "Brimful of elegant melodies and John Ross’s euphonic vocals, the album’s 10 tracks also feature riveting instrumental undergirds – alternately minimal and lush, succinct and sprawling, earthy and psychedelic. Wild Pink’s third full length sees them at their most fluent, achieving a compositional and performative apex." Chris Gee of Exclaim! wrote "While A Billion Little Lights as a whole is not as elegantly cohesive as Wild Pink's past work, the starry-eyed melodies shine stronger and more confidently than ever. The band's dreamy sentimental detailing and lustrous guitar work is as easily digestible as it is thought-provoking as the layers peel back into both nothing and everything at once." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Wild Pink * John Ross – lead vocals, bass, guitar, keyboards, percussion, additional production * T.C.

51244890	A Billion Lives	A Billion Lives is a 2016 documentary film directed and narrated by Aaron Biebert. The film stars "Winston Man" David Goerlitz, former president of the World Medical Association Dr. Delon Human, and former executive director at the World Health Organization Dr. Derek Yach. The United Nations’ World Health Organization projects that a billion people will die prematurely from smoking this century. In the next 20 years, there will be nearly 1.6 billion smokers around the world. A Billion Lives takes a critical look at the history of smoking and the corruption that has led to the current situation where safer, healthier alternatives are banned or heavily restricted in most countries, while the cigarette trade is continually protected. The film examines major conflicts of interest and corruption between governments, big pharmaceutical companies, and public health officials. It also takes a look at the history of e-cigarettes, as well as the role vapor technology and Swedish Snus has played in the current health crisis. ==Synopsis== As the film begins, viewers are confronted by a claim that "this century a billion people are projected to die from smoking." The film continues to show the depth of harm tobacco can cause to human health, including increased risk of lung cancer, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A Billion Lives continues by outlining the history of the tobacco industry, focusing primarily on tobacco corporations' attempts to hide the deleterious effects of tobacco and tobacco products. Many shots are accompanied and framed with interviews of the former Winston Man, David Goerlitz; Goerlitz, formerly the main model in a campaign by Winston Cigarettes to glamorize smoking, publicly denounced the tobacco industry in the late 1980s. The second segment of the film shifts focus from the tobacco industry to the e-cigarette and vaping industry. Showcasing interviews and talks by Dr. Derek Yach, a former World Health Organization tobacco control chief; Clive Bates, a prominent anti-smoking activist; and many other experts, Biebert narrates the possibility that e-cigarettes may be able to save a majority of the billion lives that could be lost to tobacco. The final section of the film centers on the attempts the tobacco industry has made to stop e-cigarettes from encroaching on the money-making abilities of the large multinational corporations involved. Set as an exploration of the reasons many people are critical toward vaping, the third act of the film shows how money is integral to the tobacco industry's survival. Tackling issues such as the involvement of pharmaceutical corporations and even governments in dealings with tobacco companies, the documentary reaches out to find out why there is such a negative bias toward vaping. Culminating in an extensive breakdown of how much money lies in the hands of tobacco industries, A Billion Lives covers a wide range of topics related to smoking. ==Development== The development of this documentary was led by Biebert; a filmmaker and director based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. A director and executive producer at Attention Era Media, Biebert previously consulted and helped produce music videos, event films, sport highlight films, and social media storytelling films. A Billion Lives is his first feature film. Biebert first became interested in the vaping and tobacco industry when scouting ideas for his first feature film. After researching medical facts about tobacco and vapor and finding that one billion people were projected to die from tobacco this century, Biebert became passionate about documenting the subject. In an interview with Vape Craft Incorporated, he stated: "I became angry ... since those initial feelings, the topic has become very personal to me". ==Release dates== A Billion Lives was showcased at its world premiere, held at the prestigious Doc Edge Film Festival in Wellington, New Zealand, on May 10, 2016, where it was a finalist for Best International Feature. ===North America=== A Billion Lives had its North American premiere August 6 at the historic Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin where the movie was shown to a full movie theatre of about 1,400 people.

23390905	A Bintel Brief	"A Bintel Brief" was a Yiddish advice column, starting in early 20th century New York City, that anonymously printed readers' questions and posted replies. The column was started by Abraham Cahan, the editor of Der Forverts (The Forward), in 1906. Recent Jewish immigrants, predominantly from Eastern Europe, asked for advice on various facets of their acculturation to America, including economic, family, religious and theological difficulties.Steven Bayme, Understanding Jewish History: Texts and Commentaries, p.354 In Yiddish, bintel means "bundle" and brief means a "letter" or "letters". It was a part of some people's lives to such an extent as are radio and television today. It has been the subject of books, A Bintel Brief: Sixty Years Of, by Isaac Metzker, , published by Schocken 1990, reviewed by Amazon, New York Times Book Review, New Yorker and others essays, a graphic novel‘A Bintel Brief’ Is Liana Finck’s Graphic Book of Letters New York Times Book ReviewA new comic illustrates the desperate missives sent to an immigrant advice column in old New York Slate.com Book ReviewLiana Finck, A Bintel Brief lianafinck.com and a Yiddish play. Much as "to Xerox" could be described as a commoditization of a trademarked name, the term "A Bintel Brief" has been known to be used as a generic description. The original printed Yiddish format, which The New York Times described as "homespun advice .. which predated Dear Abby," continued at least until 1970. http://www.tcr.org/tcr/essays/EPrize_Bintel.pdf, p. 4, sourced from The Concord Review, p. 216. On page 221, under "IMPACT", it is claimed that "A Bintel Brief" is considered by many historians to be the precursor to the nationally syndicated Ann Landers column." Note: This item lists many primary and secondary reference resources. The column is still published weekly on The Forward's website. In July 2021, The Forward launched a podcast version of A Bintel Brief which returned for a second 10-episode season in 2022. ==History== The column began as a response to a January 1906 letter-to-the-editor requesting assistance, which he published under the name "Bintel Brief" (a bundle of letters). The range of topics was described as "from tough bosses to rough neighborhoods, from dating to marriage to love." Readers and the column shared the goal and "belief that a newspaper could ease" the pain. The focus of the Jewish Daily Forward's Bintel Brief column was "every aspect of the immigrant experience." The goal was "Americanization." Just as immigrants needed direct help from others, there was also a need for indirect help: Some letters were written by more literate fellow immigrants, not always for free. The concept is Biblical.Deut. 15:11 ==Offline== Although leftist, "Unabashedly leftist in bent..." - this from the publisher of Bintel Brief! help was freely provided to Jews with beards as readily as with those whose had shaved them off or never had one. Help was not limited to giving advice, but also "off the page" by * hosting English language classes * sponsoring vaccination-day events in the newspaper's lobby * sending speakers to rallies they publicized regarding Jewish immigration ==References== Category:Advice columns Category:Jewish advice columnists

18868558	A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson	A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson was written by Thomas Tyers for The Gentleman's Magazine's December 1784 issue. The work was written immediately after the death of Samuel Johnson and is the first postmortem biographical work on the author. The first full length biography was written by John Hawkins and titled Life of Samuel Johnson. ==Background== There is little known about the relationship that Johnson and Tyers shared, except that Johnson claimed that "Tyers always tells him something he did not know before"Hill 1897 p. 362 and was familiarly mentioned by Johnson to Johnson's friends.Boswell 1887 p. 308 However, Johnson, in The Idler, described Tyers, called Tom Restless, as "a circumstance" and says: > "When Tom Restless rises he goes into a coffee-house, where he creeps so > near to men whom he takes to be reasoners, as to hear their discourses and > endeavours to remember something which, when it has been strained through > Tom's head, is so near to nothing, that what it once was cannot be > discovered. This he carries round from friend to friend through a circle of > visits, till, hearing what each says upon the question, he becomes able at > dinner to say a little himself; and as every great genius relaxes himself > among his inferiors, meets with some who wonder how so young a man can talk > so wisely."Hill 1897 p. 380 On 13 December 1784, Samuel Johnson died.Bate 1977 p. 600 In response to his death,Bate 1955 p. 147 the Gentleman's Magazine ran A Biographical Sketch of Dr Samuel Johnson for their December issue.Hill 1897 p. 335 The work was written in the short time between the death and the printing.Hill 1897 p. 366 Although it was the first biographical work on Johnson, the first full-length biography would be published by Murphy in 1787.Davis 1961 p. vii ==Biography== Tyers used his Biographical Sketch to discuss Johnson's mental state, but not everyone agreed with the way Tyers revealed Johnson's private life; Hester Thrale wrote, in her Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson, "Poor Johnson! I see they will leave nothing untold that I laboured so long to keep secret; & I was so very delicate in trying to conceal his fancied Insanity."Thrale 1897 p. 199 Regardless of what Thrale may have wanted, critics focused on Johnson's mental state from then after. In particular, John Wain emphasizes Tyers's description of Johnson as "like a ghost. He never speaks unless he is spoken to",Wain 1974 p. 246 which Wain considered a "bon mot".Wain 1974 p. 345 Likwise, Walter Jackson Bate relies on how Tyers was able to partly capture Johnson's "bisociative" ability to bring "together two different frames of experience".Bate 1977 p. 497 Tyers, when saying Johnson "said the most common things in the newest manner", describes Johnson's "unpredictability" and a > "further process of mind in which the original shuffling of perspectives, > already surprising us with elements we had overlooked or forgotten, is > joined by considerations drawn from other matrices of experience that can > only be described as 'moral,' that is, having to do with the condition of > man - with human hopes and fears; with values, purpose or aim; with the > shared sense, never forgotten, of the 'doom of man'; and with an unsleeping > practical urgency in considering concretely what to do and how to live." Tyers concludes his work by saying: > "At the end of this sketch, it may be hinted (sooner might have been > prepossession) that Johnson told this writer, for he saw he always had his > eye and ear upon him, that at some time or other he might be called upon to > assist a posthumous account of him. A hint was given to our author, a few > years ago, by this Rhapsodist, to write his own life, lest somebody should > write it for him. He has reason to believe, he has left a manuscript > biography behind him. His executors, all honourable men, will sit in > judgment upon his papers. Thuanus, Buchanan, Huetius, and others, have been > their own historians. The memory of some people, says Mably very lately, 'is > their understanding.' This may be thought, by some readers, to be the case > in point. Whatever anecdotes were furnished by memory, this pen did not > choose to part with to any compiler. His little bit of gold he has worked > into as much gold-leaf as he couldTyers 1897 pp. 379-380 ==Critical response== James Boswell, in his Life of Samuel Johnson, wrote: > "[Tyers] abounded in anecdote, but was no sufficiently attentive to > accuracy. I therefore cannot venture to avail myself much of a biographical > sketch of Johnson which he published, being one among the various persons > ambitious of appending their names to that of my illustrious friend. That > sketch is, however, an entertaining little collection of fragments." ==Notes== ==References== * . * . * Boswell, James. Life of Johnson Vol. 3, London: 1887. * Davis, Bertram.

Due to poor sales of Mellencamp's debut album, Chestnut Street Incident, A Biography did not receive a U.S. release upon its 1978 debut. Two of its tracks, "Taxi Dancer" and the single "I Need a Lover," were also included on his 1979 album John Cougar, which was released in the U.S. In Australia, however, "I Need a Lover" became a Top 10 hit, giving Mellencamp his first taste of success. The song would eventually crack the Top 40 in the U.S. in late 1979 when released as a single from his John Cougar album. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine described "I Need a Lover" as Mellencamp's "first good song." A Biography, along with all Mellencamp's other Riva Records/Mercury Records albums, were remastered and re-released in 2005, marking the first time A Biography was released in the United States. Mellencamp has often spoken negatively about his early albums, and A Biography is no exception. He stated in Tim Holmes’ 1986 biography: “A Biography is so bitter. I mean I don’t even like to listen to it. I can’t believe it’s me. The songs were written in ’76 or ’77. The lyrics were real awful. They were real ‘I hate you. I hate this.’ And that’s the way I felt at that time." == Track listing == == Personnel == * Johnny Cougar – lead vocals, acoustic guitar, background vocals * Brian BecVar – keyboards, background vocals * Larry Crane – guitars, background vocals * Robert "Ferd" Frank – bass, background vocals * Tom Knowles – drums, background vocals * Andy Mackay – saxophones * Ann Odell – string arrangement on "Taxi Dancer" *David Steen – photography == References == John Mellencamp Category:1978 albums Category:John Mellencamp albums Category:Albums produced by John Punter Category:Riva Records albums
67306487	A Biography of Maria Gaetana Agnesi	A Biography of Maria Gaetana Agnesi, an Eighteenth-Century Woman Mathematician: With Translations of Some of Her Work from Italian into English is a biography of Italian mathematician and philosopher Maria Gaetana Agnesi (1718–1799). It was written and translated by Antonella Cupillari, with a foreword by Patricia R. Allaire, and published in 2008 by the Edwin Mellen Press. ==Topics== The main part of the book, over 100 pages, is a translation into English of an Italian-language biography of Agnesi, Elogio storico di Donna Maria Gaetana Agnesi, which was written in the year of her death by historian Antonio Francesco Frisi and republished in 1965. It covers the cultural background that allowed her to become a mathematician, and her brief mathematical career from her teens to her thirties, as well as her work caring for the needy in the remaining fifty years of her life. Frisi was a family friend of Agnesi. He was the first to write a biography about her. To balance this material with a more objective view of Agnesi, Cupillari has added over 50 pages of notes, derived from two more Italian-language biographies of Agnesi, Maria Gaetana Àgnesi (Luisa Anzoletti, 1900) and Maria Gaetana Agnesi (Giovanna Tilche, 1984). Another large section includes translations and explanations of excerpts from Agnesi's mathematical textbook, Institutioni Analitiche (1748), which was "the first textbook to provide a unified treatment of algebra, Cartesian geometry and calculus", and by being written in vernacular Italian rather than Latin was aimed at a wider audience than the educated scholars of her day. Cupillari concludes her biography with a bibliography of material about Agnesi. ==Audience and reception== Reviewers Luigi Pepe and Franka Bruckler recommend the book as a "useful introduction" and "unique, comprehensive source" on Agnesi and her work, particularly for people who read English but not Italian. Bruckler includes among its potential readers historians of mathematics, mathematics educators, and members of the public. Reviewer Edith Mendez describes the book as "an easy read", and its mathematics as accessible to undergraduate mathematics students, but this is contradicted by Peter Ruane, who found the "fragmented" and "eulogistic" first part difficult to follow and to stomach. Mendez also criticizes the book for being inadequately copyedited, and Ruane suggests that the book would have been improved by more context of what was happening in mathematics in Europe at the time. ==References== Category:2007 non-fiction books Category:Biographies about philosophers Category:Biographies and autobiographies of mathematicians

50734216	A Bird Story	A Bird Story is an adventure role-playing video game developed and published by Freebird Games. It was released in November 2014 for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux as a minisode connecting the previous game by Freebird Games, To the Moon, with its sequel, Finding Paradise. ==Gameplay== A Bird Story is a short video-game in which the player controls an imaginative young boy who is ignored by the majority of the other characters and throughout the whole game; all characters except the boy and a few others have ghost-like bodies. When the boy finds an injured bird, he becomes happier and begins to notice more people, and his introversion lowers. The map is as though the game is a recollection of memories, instead of being in real time. The player could be in a park which leads into a hallway. In a Kotaku review, the lack of dialogue was compared to the expression "show, don't tell". ==Plot== Though never stated in the game, the protagonist of the game is Colin. Colin is an only child, whose parents are almost never home due to working long hours away. His parents are never seen, communicating with Colin mostly through written notes, but still care deeply for him. Nevertheless, Colin is very lonely, as he has no friends and is frequently chided by his teacher for never paying attention in class. One day, Colin finds a bird with an injured wing being attacked by a badger. Colin chases off the badger. The bird later winds up hiding in Colin's backpack, and Colin eventually takes it to the vet. After the vet bandages up the broken wing, Colin sneaks the bird away while the vet is looking for a bird cage. Colin spends the next several days taking care of the bird on his balcony and playing with it in the woods, dodging both the vet and the landlord, who forbids pets within the apartment complex where Colin's family lives, to maintain custody over the bird. As Colin's relationship with the bird deepens, Colin becomes less introverted and begins to connect more with his classmates. After several days, Colin becomes aware that his time with his bird is coming to an end. As he continues to play in the woods and hills with the bird, he daydreams of creating a massive paper plane using pages from his green book that he can summon at will. After a few fantasy flights, Colin returns home and takes off the bird's bandages. The bird, now fully recovered, flies off with a new mate. Though saddened, Colin is grateful to have had a friend for the first time. The experience would come to define Colin for the rest of his life, as depicted in Finding Paradise. ==Development and release== A Bird Story was developed by Freebird Games using the RPG Maker XP engine. It was ported to Linux and MacOS with the open source RPG Maker XP game engine recreation MKXP.mkxp-abs on github.com A Bird Story was primarily released as a connection between To the Moon and the proper sequel, Finding Paradise on November 5, 2014. It was the second minisode released between the publication of To the Moon and the development of Finding Paradise, which was released in December 2017. The player will control the same character in Finding Paradise as they did in A Bird Story, although Gao states that players do not need to play it to understand the sequel. The basic plot of the game is talked about in the sequel, as are mentions of To the Moon. ==Reception== A Bird Story received mixed reviews, with an overall 66/100 Metacritic rating based on 18 critic reviews. Many reviewers have compared this game to To the Moon, another game by Freebird Games. Andrew Barker, in a review for RPGFan said the game is an enjoyable experience but isn't for everyone; the game's pace moves slowly and even though it's an hour long, the memory of the game will linger. The lack of proper gameplay was criticised by many reviewers; in a Rock, Paper, Shotgun article, John Walker criticised the "incredibly slow" movement mechanics, in a Kotaku review by Cassidee Moser, the only listed con was the linearity of the gameplay and in a PC Gamer review by Tyler Wilde the game was described as dull and slow but sentimental nonetheless. The predictability of the storyline was also criticised by reviewers such as Christian Donlan from Eurogamer. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2014 video games Category:Adventure games Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code Category:RPG Maker games Category:Indie games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about birds Category:Video games about ghosts Category:Video games developed in Canada Category:Windows games Category:Freebird Games games

32341396	A Bird came down the Walk	"A Bird came down the Walk" is a short poem by Emily Dickinson (1830–1886) that tells of the poet's encounter with a worm-eating bird. The poem was first published in 1891 in the second collection of Dickinson's poems. ==Text== : Close transcriptionFr#359 in: Franklin, R. W., ed. The Poems of Emily Dickinson: Reading Edition. Cambridge, MA: The Belknap Press, 1999. First published versionPoem III.XXIII (pages 140-41) in: Higginson, T. W. & Todd, Mabel Loomis, ed. Poems by Emily Dickinson: Second Series. Boston: Roberts Brothers, 1891. A Bird, came down the Walk - He did not know I saw - He bit an Angle Worm in halves And ate the fellow, raw, And then, he drank a Dew From a convenient Grass - And then hopped sidewise to the Wall To let a Beetle pass - He glanced with rapid eyes, That hurried all abroad - They looked like frightened Beads, I thought, He stirred his Velvet Head. - Like one in danger, Cautious, I offered him a Crumb, And he unrolled his feathers, And rowed him softer Home - Than Oars divide the Ocean, Too silver for a seam, Or Butterflies, off Banks of Noon, Leap, plashless as they swim. IN THE GARDEN A bird came down the walk: He did not know I saw; He bit an angle-worm in halves And ate the fellow, raw. And then, he drank a dew From a convenient grass, And then hopped sidewise to the wall To let a beetle pass. He glanced with rapid eyes That hurried all abroad,— They looked like frightened beads, I thought; He stirred his velvet head Like one in danger; cautious, I offered him a crumb, And he unrolled his feathers And rowed him softer home Than oars divide the ocean, Too silver for a seam, Or butterflies, off banks of noon, Leap, plashless, as they swim. ==Critique== Helen Vendler regards the poem as a "bizarre little narrative" but one that typifies many of Dickinson's best qualities. She likens the poet to a reporter observing a murderer in the act, and later, pretending fear that the murderer may be dangerous to herself and must be mollified by a "crumb". The bird takes flight and Vendler regards what follows - the description of the bird in flight - as "the astonishing part of the poem". Vendler notes that the poem typifies Dickinson's "cool eye, her unsparing factuality, her startling similes and metaphors, her psychological observations of herself and others, her capacity for showing herself mistaken, and her exquisite relish of natural beauty".Helen Vendler. Dickinson: selected poems and commentaries. Harvard University Press. pp. 157ff. Harold Bloom notes that the bird displays a "complex mix of qualities: ferocity, fastidiousness, courtesy, fear, and grace", and writes that the description of the bird's flight is that seen by the soul rather than the "finite eyes".Harold Bloom. Emily Dickinson. Infobase Publishing. pp. 34ff. Vendler observes that Dickinson wrote two versions of the middle portion of the poem. The version she sent to her literary mentor Thomas Wentworth Higginson has no punctuation after "Head" and a period after the word "Cautious". In Dickinson's personal copy, there is a comma (not a period) after "Cautious". In the first version then, the bird is cautious, but in the second version, it is the poet who is cautious. In the fair copy, both a period and a dash follow "Head", and a comma follows "Cautious". The fair copy version is the one usually printed, and, as Vendler notes, this version accords with Dickinson's comic sense. ==See also== * List of Emily Dickinson poems ==References== Category:American poems Category:Poetry by Emily Dickinson Category:1891 poems Category:Poems published posthumously
23003389	A Bird in a Bonnet	A Bird in a Bonnet is a 1958 Warner Bros. Merrie Melodies animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The voices were performed by Mel Blanc, Daws Butler and June Foray. The short was released on September 27, 1958, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. ==Plot== Granny visits a 1950s New York City hat shop looking for a new hat. The sales lady has her try on several hats, but Granny seems unsatisfied with each choice (a Napoleon chapeau makes her imitate Napoleon's hand in coat pose and chuckle "Not tonight, Josephine!"). Meanwhile, Sylvester is chasing Tweety outside and Tweety makes his way into the hat shop. Just as Tweety hides at a table, Sylvester runs in and tries to rummage through the hats to look for him, but the sales lady catches him in the act, and chases him out. Just as the sales lady comes to the table where Tweety is hiding, Tweety stands real still on a hat, making the sales lady think that he's a cute little stuffed bird on a hat. After Granny tries it on, she thinks the same thing and buys the hat. Tweety soon realizes the joys of being said "stuffed bird" has a two-fold purpose, the second being that it is perfect refuge from Sylvester. But as usual, the puddy tat does everything to get at the bird, first following Granny out of the hat shop. The first time, Granny turns around, but sees Sylvester pretending to sleep. The second time, Granny quickly gets wise and swats the baritone cat with her umbrella. Other failed attempts for Sylvester to get Tweety include: * Perching himself atop a delivery truck. Just as he is about to grab dinner, the truck speeds away, requiring the cat to take the crosstown bus to return downtown. Sylvester then barely avoids getting hit by an oncoming car, causing his heart to beat fast and his fur to go white. * Hiding inside an English gentleman's hat. The man walks up beside Granny and makes a snide remark, just as Sylvester is making a grab for Tweety. Granny uses her umbrella to clout the man and — unwitting — the cat. * Following Granny into Lacy's Department Store (a play on Macy's) and into an elevator. The cat's tail gets stuck in the elevator door, and when he finally disembarks the elevator, his tail has been stretched from the store's eight floors. * At J.C. Denny's (a pun on J. C. Penney), the cat snatching Granny's hat with the obvious intent of getting Tweety. Granny follows the thieving cat outside, but Sylvester makes his getaway by putting the hat on and using a balloon to float to safety ... until Tweety pops the balloon. The hat glides to the street undamaged (where Granny retrieves it), while Sylvester plummets into a manhole ("Whoo-hoo-hoo. Hey, look at this, Ralph! A pussycat!" says an Ed Norton-esque sewer worker). * Later, using a bellows to blow Granny's hat from her head, causing it to go onto the street. Sylvester barely avoids getting hit by several cars and recovers the hat, but he is struck by a motorscooter driving from an alley. Granny manages to retrieve the hat safely. In the ending gag, Sylvester uses a fishing rod and reel to latch onto the hat. Granny gets into a taxi, and Sylvester is pulled away by the speeding driver. After being an unwilling car skier for several city blocks (and nearly getting hit by two trucks), Sylvester eventually realizes he needs to reel himself in ... which he does to open the taxi's sunroof and grab Tweety. Just after saying his only line in the cartoon — "Now I've got you, buster!" — the car drives into the Holland Tunnel, where the cat hits his head against the side of the entrance; the bird flies out of his hand and back safely onto the taxicab's roof. "You know, I wose more puddy tats that way!" remarks Tweety as the cartoon ends. ==Score== "A Bird in a Bonnet" is one of six cartoons scored with stock music by John Seely from the Capitol Records Hi-Q library because of a musician's strike in 1958; the others are Weasel While You Work, Hip Hip-Hurry!, Hook, Line and Stinker, Gopher Broke, and Pre-Hysterical Hare. This cartoon is the only Friz Freleng cartoon to have a Seely score; two others were directed by Chuck Jones (both starring Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner), while the remaining three were helmed by Robert McKimson. ==See also== * List of American films of 1958 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1958 films Category:Merrie Melodies short films Category:Warner Bros.

26953643	A Bird in a Gilded Cage	"A Bird in a Gilded Cage" is a song composed by Arthur J. Lamb and Harry Von Tilzer. It was a sentimental ballad (or tear-jerker) that became one of the most popular songs of 1900, reportedly selling more than two million copies in sheet music.Ruhlmann, William. Breaking Records (One Hundred Years of Hits), New York & London: Routledge Taylor & Francis Group, 2004, p.8 Jere Mahoney (Edison) and Steve Porter (Columbia) recorded two early popular versions of this song. ==Background== According to Von Tilzer, he was approached in 1899 by Lamb with the lyrics for a song. Although Von Tilzer liked it, he asked Lamb to change some of the words to make it clear that the woman in the song was married and not a mistress. Later that evening, as he worked out a melody at a piano in a public house with some friends, he noticed that many of the girls nearby were crying, which convinced him the song could be a hit. Later, Von Tilzer would claim that this song was "the key that opened the door of wealth and fame" for him. Its success signalled the dominance of ballads in American popular music through 1914. ==Synopsis== The song describes the sad life of a beautiful woman who has married for money instead of love. Its lyrics are as follows: The ballroom was filled with fashion's throng, It shone with a thousand lights, And there was a woman who passed along, The fairest of all the sights, A girl to her lover then softly sighed, There's riches at her command; But she married for wealth, not for love, he cried, Though she lives in a mansion grand. She's only a bird in a gilded cage, A beautiful sight to see, You may think she's happy and free from care, She's not, though she seems to be, 'Tis sad when you think of her wasted life, For youth cannot mate with age, And her beauty was sold, For an old man's gold, She's a bird in a gilded cage. I stood in a churchyard just at eve', When sunset adorned the west, And looked at the people who'd come to grieve, For loved ones now laid at rest, A tall marble monument marked the grave, Of one who'd been fashion's queen, And I thought she is happier here at rest, Than to have people say when seen, ==In popular culture== Tony Martin sings it with Edith Fellows in the movie "Music in my Heart." Bing Crosby included the song in a medley on his album On the Sentimental Side (1962). The song is performed by the heroine Nellie in Matthew O'Reilley's melodramatic operetta "Lost in the City (or The Triumph of Nellie)," which was a popular choice for high school productions in the early 1980s. Sylvester Stallone sings the song in his guest spot of The Muppet Show. Elmo sings the first verse of this song when he is a pet bird in a bird cage in the Elmo's World segment Pets on Sesame Street. Malcolm McLaren produced, together with Bootsy Collins, a cover version of "Bird in a Gilded Cage" in hiphop style as a bonus track for a release from his album Waltz Darling, The House of the Blue Danube. (1989). Kristin Chenoweth sings the song as Lavinia Peck-Foster in season 2 episode 2 of Trial & Error. In the 2007 film “The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford” Zooey Deschanel’s character Dorthy Evans performs the song at a burlesque show in Creede, Colorado. "Bird in a Gilded Cage" is the title of Episode 17 of Season 6 of The Vampire Diaries (2015); in Season 7, Episode 13 ("This Woman's Work," 2016), the character Beau, played by Jaiden Kaine, sings snatches of the song while exiting an English tavern in 1903. One episode of the television series Land of the Giants was titled "The Golden Cage" about an Earthling who lives in a lavish bungalow set up by the "giants". == See also == * List of best- selling sheet music ==References== ==External links== Category:1900 songs Category:20th-century ballads Category:American songs Category:Songs with music by Harry Von Tilzer Category:Songs with lyrics by Arthur J.

25882383	A Bird in a Guilty Cage	A Bird in a Guilty Cage is a 1952 Looney Tunes animated short directed by Friz Freleng. The short was released on August 30, 1952, and stars Tweety and Sylvester. The title is a pun on the song "A Bird in a Gilded Cage". ==Plot== Sylvester is at a store called Stacy's, where he notices Tweety in the window stand. Going through the package slot, he closes the curtains and climbs up to Tweety's cage, who asks him what he's going to do. After asiding to the audience, "How naive can ya get?", Sylvester replies that they're going to play a game called Sandwich, involving Tweety getting sandwiched in two slices of bread and nearly eaten ("I don't wike dat game!"). Tweety flees, with Sylvester in hot pursuit. The cat is forced to stack mannequins on top of each other to reach the canary, who is hiding in the lighting. Tweety climbs down and puts skates on the mannequin statue to push the structure down some stairs. He returns however, and the chase resumes, leading him to a hat sale, where he begins trying on hats. He finds the one with Tweety on top, and tries to smash him, instead hitting himself. Tweety then hides in a dollhouse, which eventually ends with Sylvester shooting his own finger. A final sequence involves a gun in a hole gag, where as Sylvester shoves his gun in a hole in the wall, another is aimed at his rear. Predictably, this ends in Sylvester getting his buttocks shot. Tweety then goes through the pneumatic tubes of Stacy's, with Sylvester going to the other end to catch him. However, Tweety comes out a different hole, and puts a stick of dynamite in. Sylvester swallows it, thinking he has gotten Tweety, but as he strolls out, it explodes, leaving him blackened. He then decides to cross off birds from his diet, saying to himself that "That one sort of upset my stomach!". ==Trivia== * Sylvester would check birds off his diet list in two other cartoons, Tweet Zoo and Trip for Tat. * Mel Blanc's voice for Tweety was raised to an extra pitch in this cartoon and would stay at that pitch until Muzzle Tough released in 1954. It actually first happened in the 1950 short Canary Row, but went back to the original edited pitch in the 1951 short, Putty Tat Trouble. ==Home media== *Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2 DVD ==References== ==External links== * Category:Short films directed by Friz Freleng Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:Warner Bros.

14527359	A Bird in the Head	A Bird in the Head is a 1946 short subject directed by Edward Bernds starring American slapstick comedy team The Three Stooges (Moe Howard, Larry Fine and Curly Howard). It is the 89th entry in the series released by Columbia Pictures starring the comedians, who released 190 shorts for the studio between 1934 and 1959. ==Plot== The Stooges are mediocre paperhangers. Their boss Mr. Beedle (Robert Williams) advises the boys to do a good job, but the result looks like it was quickly cluttered with paper towels. Beedle is fuming, and threatens to kill the boys, who make a quick escape across the hallway into the laboratory of the insane Professor Panzer (Vernon Dent) and his assistant Nikko (Frank Lackteen). Panzer is searching for a human brain puny enough to place in the head of his gorilla Igor (Art Miles). Curly becomes the prime candidate, and Panzer locks the boys in his lab in order to secure Curly's "contribution." Then Igor gets loose, but takes a liking to Curly, which the feeble-minded Stooge reciprocates. Eventually, the boys destroy Panzer's lab and quickly depart, taking Igor with them. ==Cast== * Moe Howard as Moe * Larry Fine as Larry * Curly Howard as Curly * Vernon Dent as Professor Panzer * Frank Lackteen as Nikko * Robert Williams as Mr. Beedle * Art Miles as Igor the Gorilla (uncredited) ==Production notes== The title A Bird in the Head is a pun on the phrase "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." A Bird in the Head was filmed over a period of five days (April 9–13, 1945), which was longer than usual. Due to the death of President Franklin D. Roosevelt on April 12, filming ended early out of respect for the deceased Commander-in-chief. 41-year-old Curly Howard had suffered a series of minor strokes prior to filming A Bird in the Head. As a result, his performance was marred by slurred speech, and slower timing. This film was the first directing effort for former Columbia sound man Edward Bernds. Bernds was thrilled that he was being given a shot at directing, but was horrified when he realized that Curly was in such bad shape (something Columbia short subject head/director Jules White failed to alert Bernds of). Years later, Bernds discussed his trying experience during the filming of A Bird in the Head: Realizing that Curly was no longer able to perform in the same capacity as before, Bernds devised ways to cover his illness; Curly could still be the star, but the action was shifted away from the ailing Stooge. In A Bird in the Head, the action focuses more on crazy Professor Panzer and Igor. This allowed Curly to maintain a healthy amount of screen time without being required to contribute a great deal. Bernds often commented that he and Jules White never really got along. Bernds feared that his directing days would be over as soon as they began if he released A Bird in the Head with a weak Curly as his first entry. Producer Hugh McCollum reshuffled the release order, and the superior Micro-Phonies was released first, securing Bernds directing position.

"That house in Manawaka: Margaret Laurence's A Bird in the House: Review", The American Review of Canadian Studies 26 (1): 135.Kertzer, Jon (1992). That house in Manawaka: Margaret Laurence's A Bird in the House. Toronto: ECW Press. Noted by Laurence to be "semi-autobiographical",Foster Stovel, Nora (winter 1999/2000). "Mourning becomes Margaret: Laurence's farewell to fiction", Journal of Canadian Studies 34 (4): 105–21. the series chronicles the growing up of a young agnostic writer, Vanessa MacLeod, in the fictional town of Manawaka, Manitoba.Tracy, Honor (April 19, 1970). "Growing up in Manawaka: A Bird in The House", The New York Times, p. 336. A Bird in the House was written from the perspective of Vanessa at age forty, while she recalls her childhood (with the exception of the final chapter Jericho's Brick Battlements, when she revisits her childhood home). It is therefore impossible to tell if young Vanessa was truly able to understand the events unfolding around her, or if she gained that understanding later in life. Originally published as a series of independent short stories, ==Main characters== Vanessa MacLeod: The protagonist, various ages throughout the novel. The character is a middle-aged woman who uses flashback to reveal lessons learned from her family as she grows up. Beth MacLeod, Vanessa's mother: Beth is a former nurse, as it is revealed in Chapter 3, "The Mask of the Bear". Now that she has children, she is a homemaker and peacemaker. She avoids conflict, especially with her hot-tempered father. She has a close relationship with her sister, Edna. Ewen MacLeod, Vanessa's father: A doctor, like his father. He is unable to make money to support the family during the great depression, a time when people often pay him in chicken and potatoes. His father-in-law, Timothy Connor, often criticizes him for this lack of wealth. He was a soldier during World War I, and witnessed the death of his younger brother Roderick. It is possible that he blames himself for his brother's death. He has an extensive collection of books about travel, which he thumbs through longingly, but never uses because he has never been able to travel. Roderick MacLeod, Vanessa's younger brother: Born in Chapter 2, "To Set Our House In Order". He is named after Ewen's brother, who died in World War I. Edna Connor: Beth's sister, Vanessa's maternal aunt. A light-hearted and beautiful but troubled woman. She lives with her parents until she is twenty-eight, cooking and cleaning, unable to find a job and unwilling to marry simply for escape. Vanessa loves her for her kindness and admires her for her glamour. She and Vanessa are the only characters who argue with Timothy Connor. In Chapter 3, "The Mask Of The Bear", she receives a visit from an old lover, Jimmy Lorimer. He comes to the house for dinner, and Edna's father is cruel and rude to him. The author implies that all of Edna's suitors have received this kind of harsh treatment. In Chapter 8, "Jericho's Brick Battlements", she marries Wes Grigg, who works for the Canadian National Railway. The narrator implies that Edna has found happiness with Wes, who shares Edna's warm sense of humour, and who is able to stand up to Grandfather Connor. Timothy Connor: Vanessa's maternal grandfather. He is married to Agnes Connor, and they have several adult children. Two of them are his daughters, Beth and Edna. He is a prejudiced, gruff, impatient, unsympathetic, demanding, complaining person, who constantly criticizes. Many of the novel's conflicts focus on the other characters trying to ask him for help or approval, which he refuses. He is represented in several symbols in the novel, including his proud brick house, his rugged bear-skin coat, and his dilapidated old car. He has worked hard for all of his life, something he brings up often and loudly. He proclaims at various points throughout the novel, "all labour unions were composed of thugs and crooks; if people were unemployed it was due to their own laziness; if people were broke it was because they were not thrifty" (Chapter 3, "The Mask of the Bear"). Agnes Connor: Vanessa's maternal grandmother. Quiet, religious, unfailingly kind and calm. She is a foil character for her husband, and she is the only character to successfully oppose him. For example, when Timothy Connor has a fight with his brother Dan, Agnes quietly states "you'd best go after him", which Timothy does (Chapter 1, "The Sound of the Singing"). Because she never reveals any of her emotions on the surface, she is a difficult character to understand, something which Vanessa points out several times. "It was tacitly understood among all members of the family that Grandmother was not to be upset. Only Grandfather was allowed to upset her. The rest of us coddled her gladly, assuming that she needed protection...If it had been a weekday, she would have been knitting an afghan, but as it was Sunday she was reading the Bible with the aid of a magnifying glass. She did not believe in eyeglasses, which were, she thought, unnatural. She did not believe in smoking or drinking or the playing of cards, either, but she never pushed her beliefs at other people nor made any claims for her own goodness" (Chapter 1, "The Sound of the Singing"). Dan Connor: Timothy Connor's brother, Vanessa's great uncle. Vanessa describes him as "downright", because he is low-class. "He had a farm in South Wachakwa Valley, but he never planted any crops. He raised horses, and spent most of his time travelling around the country, selling them. At least, he was supposed to be selling them, but Aunt Edna said that he had horse-trading in his blood and couldn't resist swapping, so he usually came back to Manawaka with the same number of horses he started out with, only they were different horses and no money. He had never married. [Vanessa] liked him because he always carried brown hot-tasting humbugs in his pockets, usually covered with navy fluff from his coat, and he sang Irish songs" (Chapter 1, "The Sound of the Singing"). Nevertheless, Vanessa is embarrassed by him because he is often unkempt and dirty, and he is eccentric and overly friendly. Grandmother MacLeod: Vanessa's paternal grandmother. A conservative woman who is unable to accept the family's change in circumstances. She behaves as if the family is still wealthy, ordering fancy linens and silver from catalogues == Chapter summaries == A Bird in The House has been reprinted multiple times. A new edition was issued by McClelland & Stewart as part of the New Canadian Library in January 2010. CHAPTER 1: The Sound of the Singing In this chapter, we get to know Vanessa, a 12-year-old girl, and her family. She describes herself as a "professional listener" because she grows up in an adult environment, so she hears all their conversations. That night, the family will have dinner in the Brick House, Nessa's grandparent's house. They received an unexpected visit from Uncle Dan. Agnes, Vanessa's grandmother, asks her husband to treat him nicely and behave. So, he is the only one allowed to smoke in the house. The visitor is a cheerful person and starts to sing. Timothy (her brother and Nessa's grandfather) stops him and gets furious when he asks him for money. He throws him out of the house, but obeying orders from his wife (Agnes), he goes and looks for him outside. That is when the child discovers that Uncle Dan was once in love with her grandma. Both brothers come inside again and share a coffee. Then, Uncle Dan leaves the house, singing, and Vanessa runs after him to keep him company for a while. Chapter 2: To Set Our House in Order. In chapter two of "A Bird in the House" by Margaret Laurence, the narrator, Vanessa, recounts her childhood memories of growing up in the small town of Manawaka, Manitoba. She reflects on her family, including her mother and father, her grandparents, and her aunt. Vanessa describes her family as being close-knit, but also notes the tension and conflicts that existed within the household. She also describes the town of Manawaka and the people who lived there, painting a picture of a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other's business. The chapter ends with Vanessa reflecting on the role of storytelling in her family and the way it helped her to understand and make sense of her experiences. Chapter 3: The Mask of the Bear. In chapter three of "A Bird in the House" by Margaret Laurence, the narrator, Vanessa, continues to reflect on her childhood memories of growing up in the small town of Manawaka. She describes her relationship with her grandparents, particularly her grandfather, who she was very close with. She also talks about her grandmother, who was a strict and religious woman, who was always concerned about the moral well-being of the family. Vanessa describes how her grandparents' home was a place of refuge for her, where she felt safe and loved. She also describes the role that religion played in her family, with her grandmother being a devout member of the Baptist church, and how this affected the family's beliefs and values. The chapter ends with Vanessa reflecting on the sense of belonging and rootedness that she felt in Manawaka, and how it shaped her identity. The chapter contains the death of Vanessa's Grandmother Connor, and highlights the strained relationship she had with her husband, Grandfather Connor. He is shown to be a proud man without the ability to show strong emotions other than contempt or anger - to don the "mask of the bear". His relationship with his daughters, especially with Vanessa's aunt Edna, is also highlighted, with Timothy Connor revealed as a controlling and difficult man who often scared Edna's suitors away. ==References== Category:1970 short story collections Category:Books by Margaret Laurence Category:Manitoba in fiction Category:Canadian short story collections Category:New Canadian Library

49242941	A Birthday Cake for George Washington	A Birthday Cake for George Washington is a children's picture book written by Ramin Ganeshram and illustrated by Vanessa Brantley-Newton, published by Scholastic and first released on January 5, 2016. It is narrated by Delia, the daughter of Hercules, one of George Washington's slaves who worked for him as a cook. The book tells the story of Hercules and Delia baking a birthday cake for Washington. Scholastic pulled the book on January 17, 2016 in response to criticism that the illustrations depicted an overly-positive portrayal of slavery. ==Criticism== While generally praised by traditional reviewers, Vicky Smith wrote about problems with the book in her article "Smiling Slaves in a Post-A Fine Dessert World" in Kirkus Reviews on January 4, 2016. Smith, Kirkus Reviews' children's and teen book editor, compared the book to A Fine Dessert by Emily Jenkins, another picture book which proved controversial because it depicted images of smiling slaves. She notes that Ganeshram did not mention in the narrative that when the real life Hercules escaped to freedom from Washington, he was forced to leave his daughter behind. Smith concluded that "It’s easy to understand why Ganeshram opted to leave those details out of her primary narrative: they’re a serious downer for readers, and they don’t have anything to do with the cake. But the story that remains nevertheless shares much of what ‘A Fine Dessert’’s critics found so objectionable: it’s an incomplete, even dishonest treatment of slavery.” This was followed by more critiques, including of the illustrations of the characters as “smiling slaves” and thereby whitewashing the history of slavery and presenting an "offensively sanitized version" of slavery to children. Among the critics were Kiera Parrott, who wrote in School Library Journal that the book was "highly problematic" and that it "convey[s] a feeling of joyfulness that contrasts starkly with the reality of slave life". As of January 18, the book had received over 100 one-star ratings on Amazon.com. On January 13, 2016, a critical review of the book by librarian Edith Campbell was posted on the Facebook page of the Washington, DC-based nonprofit Teaching for Change, alongside a photo of the book’s back cover. On this same day, Leslie MacFadyen of the National Ferguson Response Network entered the conversation and developed the hashtag #slaverywithasmile. This took the discussion beyond the children’s literature world to parents, educators, and activists. It also caught the attention of major media outlets, including the Atlanta Black Star, The Root, and Fusion. Thousands signed a protest petition at Change.org. Food historian Michael W. Twitty critiqued historical elements of the book in The Guardian while author Steve Sheinkin discussed the book in an Actually podcast. Debbie Reese of American Indians in Children’s Literature—who had played a major role drawing public attention to the Mexican American studies ban in Tucson—documented the evolution of events on her blog. Author Daniel José Older tweeted about the book. Older's tweets, the petition, and a summary of the campaign were published on Common Dreams. The controversy evolved into discussions about how to present enslavement in children’s books. ==Withdrawal== Scholastic withdrew the book on January 17, 2016 following the criticism. In a statement, the publisher said: ===Reaction to withdrawal=== The decision to withdraw the book was criticized by anti-censorship activists like the National Coalition Against Censorship (NCAC) and the PEN American Center, which released a statement saying that "Those who value free speech as an essential human right and a necessary precondition for social change should be alarmed whenever books are removed from circulation because they are controversial". The NCAC's statement also defended the book by saying that it had helped promote discussion about how Americans remember slavery. Scholastic responded to this statement by accusing both the NCAC and PEN of not correctly reading Scholastic's initial statement, and asserting that the book was withdrawn "not in response to criticism, but entirely and purposefully because this title did not meet our publishing standards" although Scholastic, not the author, or illustrator, was solely in charge of the publishing process. In an interview with the Associated Press, the author responded to the public outcry and withdrawal of the book, stating that she had continually voiced concerns about the “over jovial” depiction of the enslaved characters but that she had been repeatedly ignored by the publisher. The book’s editor Andrea Davis Pinkney and illustrator Vanessa Brantley-Newton did not respond for requests for comment from the Associated Press. Farah Mendlesohn wrote that the decision by Scholastic to withdraw the book was product recall, not censorship, and argued that if "it is acceptable and “free speech” to turn [the story of Hercules] into a happy little story about a slave serving his master joyfully, then I look forward to Scholastic producing a bright little picture book called The Children’s Choir of Terezin." ==See also== * Washington's Birthday ==References== == External links == *Slavery in children's books: What works? in the Chicago Tribune by Nara Schoenberg, February 15, 2016 *Children's Literature About Slavery: The Struggle Continues Storify of tweets, compiled by Ebony Elizabeth-Thomas Category:2016 children's books Category:American picture books Category:African-American-related controversies Category:Cultural depictions of George Washington Category:Scholastic Corporation books Category:Novels about American slavery
37253684	A Birthday Hansel	A Birthday Hansel, Op. 92, is a song cycle for 'high voice' and harp composed by Benjamin Britten and set to texts by Robert Burns. The last song cycle that Britten wrote, it was composed in honour of the Queen Mother's 75th birthday, at the request of her daughter, Elizabeth II. (The Queen Mother was patron of the Aldeburgh Festival.) Composed in March 1975, the piece was given its debut performance in January 1976 by Britten's life partner Peter Pears and harpist Osian Ellis. It was the last piece which Britten wrote for Pears, and one of his very last works. In recognition of the Queen Mother's Scottish ancestry, Britten chose seven poems by Burns, sung in the Scots language, and performed without a break. 'Hansel' is a Scots word meaning welcome gift or present. At Britten's request, Colin Matthews arranged four of the songs for voice and piano; these were published separately as Four Burns Songs in 1978. ==Songs== The songs are: # "Birthday Song" # "My Early Walk" # "Wee Willie Gray" # "My Hoggie" # "Afton Water" # "The Winter" # "Leezie Lindsay" A complete performance takes about 18 minutes. Musicologist Peter Evans has analysed the cycle. It is through-composed, with the harp supplying transitions from the mood of one poem to the next. As befits a birthday gift, it does not attempt to point out morals nor to invite deep reflection. The songs do not explicitly utilise Scottish musical forms, but are flavoured by echoes of them. Although the texts are all by a single poet, the cycle does not have a sense of the cumulative illumination of the poet's creative character as is found in other such cycles by Britten. It is "delightful but undemanding". ==References== * Category:Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother Category:Compositions for harp Category:Song cycles by Benjamin Britten Category:Adaptations of works by Robert Burns Category:1975 compositions Category:Classical song cycles in English

17953320	A Bit of Fry & Laurie	A Bit of Fry & Laurie is a British sketch comedy television series written by and starring former Cambridge Footlights members Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie, broadcast on both BBC1 and BBC2 between 1989 and 1995. It ran for four series and totalled 26 episodes, including a 36-minute pilot episode in 1987. As in The Two Ronnies, elaborate wordplay and innuendo were staples of its material. It frequently broke the fourth wall; characters would revert into their real- life actors mid-sketch, or the camera would often pan off set into the studio. In addition, the show was punctuated with non sequitur vox pops in a similar style to those of Monty Python's Flying Circus, often making irrelevant statements, heavily based on wordplay. Laurie was also seen playing piano and a wide variety of other instruments and singing comical numbers. == Broadcast details == The 36-minute pilot was broadcast on BBC1 at 11:55pm on Boxing Day 1987, although it was later edited down to 29 minutes for repeat transmissions (including broadcasts on the Paramount Comedy Channel). The full version is intact on the Series 1 DVD. It was the first pilot Fry and Laurie had produced for the BBC since 1983; their previous attempt, The Crystal Cube, had not met with the BBC's approval. The show began its full run at 9pm on Friday 13 January 1989. The first three series were screened on BBC2, the traditional home for the BBC's sketch shows, while the fourth series switched to the mainstream BBC1. The last series was the least well-received, for a number of reasons: BBC1 was not the best place to showcase Fry and Laurie's arch humour; it featured celebrity guests in all but one episode, an addition which neither Fry nor Laurie approved; and it was shown not long after Stephen Fry's nervous breakdown in 1995, which cast a shadow over the series. One reviewer said that, perhaps owing to this, Fry got more of the laughs, while Laurie was increasingly relegated to the "straight man" role. From series 1–3 there were also several occasional guest artists, before they were made a permanent fixture during series 4, including Selina Cadell (Series 2, episode 4), Paul Eddington (Series 2, episode 5), Nigel Havers (Series 2, episode 6), Rowan Atkinson (Series 2, episode 6), Nicholas Parsons (Series 3, episode 1), Rebecca Saire (Series 3, episode 2 and 5), Gary Davies (Series 3, episode 6) and Colin Stinton (Series 3, episode 6). In 2010, the duo reunited for a retrospective special, titled Fry and Laurie Reunited. == Satire == thumb|A scene from one of the many sketches in the show, entitled The Privatisation of the Police Force The show did not shy away from commenting on issues of the day. A sketch in the second series, in which a Conservative government minister is strangled while Stephen Fry screams at him "What are you doing to the television system? What are you doing to the country?", is an attack on the Broadcasting Act of 1990 and the perceived motivations of those who supported it. The pair would later attack what they saw as the Act's malign after effects in the sketch "It's a Soaraway Life", a parody of It's a Wonderful Life evoking a world in which Rupert Murdoch never existed. The series made numerous jokes at the expense of the Tory prime ministers of the time, Margaret Thatcher and John Major, and one sketch depicted a televised "Young Tory of the Year" competition in which a young Conservative (Laurie) recites a deliberately incoherent speech consisting only of nonsense political buzzwords, such as "family values" and "individual enterprise". Noel Edmonds was also a frequent target. During a sketch where Fry had supposedly removed Laurie's brain, Laurie came out and said that he had just finished watching Noel Edmonds and that he is fantastic. == Catchphrases == === "Please, Mr Music, will you play?" === Each episode of Series 3 and 4 ends with Stephen Fry preparing a ridiculously named and even more ridiculously concocted cocktail. While he does this, Fry entreats Laurie to play the closing theme by saying, "Please, Mr Music, will you play?", a phrase Fry took from the Anglia TV children's TV show Romper Room.Twitter - Stephen Fry, 10:22 AM - 2 May 2012 Fry then shakes the cocktail while dancing eccentrically and serves it to Laurie (in Series 3) or the guest performers (in Series 4), while Laurie plays the piano and imitates the sound of a muted trombone. Both in Series 3 and 4, Fry precedes the question with increasingly silly introductions: * "I say, as I like to on these occasions, those six refreshing words that unlock the door to sophisticated evening happiness. I say:" (Series 4, episode 3) * "And now into the cocktail shaker of my mouth I throw these six words: You Please Music Mr Will Play. I give a brief shake [he shakes his head and makes "brr" noises], and I pour out this golden phrase:" (Series 4, episode 4) * "And as I prepare your Swinging Ballsacks, I ask this question, in accordance with known principles:" (Series 4, episode 5) * "While I mix these, I turn to the debonair doyen of the dance and I ask as askingly as I might this ask:" (Series 4, episode 6) * [Preparing a "Modern Britain"] "But perhaps, somewhere, you might be inspired to add one small, tender, caring cherry of hope. I wonder. While you decide, I will entreat for the very finalest of last, last times, this entreaty of m'colleague, Britain's very own melody man, as I say to him, please, please, oh:" (Series 4, episode 7) === "Soupy twist" === The catchphrase "soupy twist" is said by both Laurie and Fry at the end of each episode of series 3 and 4 (save the Series 3 closer), in a manner similar to 'cheers'. === "If you'll pardon the pun" === A running joke had one character adding "if you'll pardon the pun" mid-conversation, when there had, in fact, been no pun uttered. The second character, puzzled, would say, "What pun?" and the first character would say, "Oh, wasn't there one? I'm sorry", and resume the conversation. === "M'colleague" === "M'colleague" is a phrase that Fry and Laurie began using during the second series to refer to each other. Both have since used this phrase outside the series to refer to the other, for example on chat shows, the dedication in Fry's novel The Stars' Tennis Balls which reads "To m'colleague", as well as the one in his second autobiography, The Fry Chronicles, which reads "To m'coll". === "No relation" === A running gag in which either Fry or Laurie, after mentioning another character by name, follows with "no relation" as if implying that their names—which are invariably completely different from Fry and Laurie's names—would lead viewers into believing them to be a relative. == Recurring characters == Though the programme mostly consisted of one-time situations and sketches, a few characters appeared over several episodes and series. === Alan === Alan (Laurie) is hired as a secret agent by a mysterious organisation known only as 'The Department', before which he was a gun-runner, supply teacher, and Home Secretary. The character is a parody of several television shows of the 1970s, most prominently The Professionals. === The Bishop and the Warlord === The Bishop (Fry) and the Warlord (Laurie) first appear in series 1, episode 4. They are portrayed as the world's leading "light metal" band (as opposed to heavy metal). The Warlord (guitarist) is dressed as a typical rocker, whereas the Bishop (vocalist) is dressed in his normal vestments, and one black fingerless glove. He sings (or rather speaks) his songs from a pulpit. === Control and Tony === Control (Fry) and Tony Murchison (Laurie) are two excessively nice secret agents who first appear in series 1 of the show. Control is head of SIS, the British secret service. Tony Murchison is Subsection Chief of the East Germany and Related Satellites Desk, who brings Control his morning coffee. The characters discuss issues of national security with childish simplicity to parody the typically sparse details viewers were often afforded in British films of a similar genre. Much of the humour in these sketches arises from the stilted, amateurish, and inappropriate performance style. There were two written, but unaired, sketches featuring the pair, entitled "Spies Five" and "Spies/Twin"—the latter revealing that Control (whose real name was, in fact, Control) had a twin brother also named Control, who painted erotic murals in Earl's Court. The scripts for these sketches are available in the script-books. === Gelliant Gutfright === Gelliant (Fry) is the host of short horror programme The Seventh Dimension, who presents bizarre and nonsensical stories such as "Flowers for Wendy" and "The Red Hat of Patferrick". Seated in an improbably large gold-buttoned leather chair, he indulges in elaborate and often pointless wordplay: "It is called 'Flowers for Wendy', but might it not rather have been called 'You have been Warned'? [pause] No, it might not." The stories told were often in the style of The Twilight Zone. === Gordon and Stuart === Gordon (Fry) and Stuart (Laurie) are executives and old friends. Stuart is brash, arrogant and with a hugely inflated sense of his abilities in and out of the office. He often bullies and patronises the mild-mannered Gordon, who in fact displays far greater knowledge and better control of the situation. For instance, when the two lunch at a Greek restaurant, Gordon speaks fluent Greek to the waiter while Stuart, having boasted of his affinity with the Greek people and his appreciation for their cuisine, fails to recognise dolmades and retsina wine. Gordon does not seem to resent Stuart's obnoxious treatment of him or his behaviour in general, and continues to cheerfully and skilfully deal with the situation, inadvertently showing Stuart to be hopelessly outclassed. This causes Stuart great consternation as he attempts to conceal his own inabilities and maintain his reputation as an intelligent and competent businessman. === Jack and Freddy/Neddy === Freddy (Laurie; character later renamed 'Neddy') is a meek, quiet man with a noticeable overbite (Laurie's performance is an homage to Peter Sellers' Lionel Mandrake in Dr. Strangelove). Jack (Fry) is an eyepatch-wearing, imposing man who belongs to an unnamed organisation. He recruits Freddy to participate in several of the organisation's efforts for the "cause", which he states to be freedom, although this may be hyperbolic. The characters stopped appearing after Neddy became Prime Minister. Neddy was being force-fed information from Jack when it became clear that Jack's organisation was a group of Nazis who were bent on ruling England through Neddy. Jack then stabbed Neddy in the back with his own Stanley knife. === John and Peter === John (Fry) and Peter (Laurie) are hard- driving, hard-drinking executives who are always partners, no matter what business they happen to be running; in most of their sketches they run a health club. Their antagonist in every business operation is the diabolical Marjorie (John's ex-wife). Eventually, Marjorie defeated the pair in the health club business off-screen, leading the two to run a public toilet and later the Diocese of Uttoxeter (John as Bishop, Peter as Executive Vice- Bishop). Although based in Uttoxeter throughout the series, John and Peter speak with American accents. The sketch is a parody of television drama of the period such as BBC TV's Howards' Way, which depicted relatively small-scale businessmen as larger-than-life, world-weary, passionate, and tormented. John and Peter are invariably exhorting one another to greater efforts on behalf of their relatively insignificant businesses, with their shouted catchphrases "Damn!" and "Dammit John!". They also drink very, very excessively. One written sketch entitled "Dammit 3" was unaired; those actually shown in the programme went straight from "Dammit 2" to "Dammit 4". The script for this sketch is available in the script books and online. === Mr Dalliard === Mr Dalliard is a non-appearing character in various sketches, all taking place in a shop environment. Though Dalliard never appears, and is implied to be a creation of Fry's shopkeeper's imagination, he is referred and spoken to several times in every sketch: "He isn't my Mr Dalliard, he's everybody's Mr Dalliard". === Tony Inchpractice === Tony (Laurie) first appears in series 2. He is the host of several talk shows, each one devoted to an odd action performed by the host and the guest during the course of the interview. The different shows are: Trying to Borrow a Fiver Off..., Introducing My Grandfather To..., Photocopying My Genitals With..., Realising I've Given the Wrong Directions To..., and Flying a Light Aeroplane Without Having Had Any Formal Instruction With.... The character was originally modelled upon a similar figure named Peter Mostyn whom Laurie had earlier portrayed on Saturday Live. There was also a similar sketch called In the Bath With... on the radio series Saturday Night Fry. === Vox pops === Between sketches, both Laurie and Fry appear as people in the street, including a police officer; a drifting geek; a woman who suddenly remembers she has "left the iron on"; a pensioner who says that he "wouldn't suck it", without specifying what 'it' is and then walking off laughing; an old conservative; and others. Such insertions became less frequent in the last two series. == Episodes == * Pilot: 26 December 1987 (36 minutes) * Series One: 13 January 1989 – 17 February 1989 (six episodes) * Series Two: 9 March 1990 – 13 April 1990 (six episodes) * Series Three: 9 January 1992 – 13 February 1992 (six episodes) * Series Four: 12 February 1995 – 2 April 1995 (seven episodes) Two compilations were broadcast on BBC Radio 4 on 11 August 1994. == DVD releases == After much fan-driven petition, the first series of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, plus the pilot, was released on DVD on 3 April 2006 in Region 2. Series two was released on 12 June, with a bonus feature, the 45-minute Cambridge Footlights Revue (1982) in which Fry and Laurie appear with Emma Thompson, Tony Slattery, Penny Dwyer and Paul Shearer. The third series followed in October 2006. Amazon UK released a complete box set (all 4 series) on 30 October 2006, along with series 4 itself. Series 1 was released on 6 July 2007 in Region 4. Region 1 versions of the first two series were released in the United States and Canada on 22 August 2006. There is a copyright-related music edit on the series 1 DVD during the final sketch of episode 6 ("Tony of Plymouth (Sword Fight)"). In the broadcast version, the music was from the soundtrack of "The Sea Hawk" but instead a new piece of music has been used, drowning out most of the dialogue in the process. In series 2, Saint-Saëns is not credited for the end music ("Finale" from The Carnival of the Animals) until the second half of the series. On the series 3 DVD for Region 1, the sketch which features Laurie and Fry singing The Beatles' "Hey Jude" has been omitted. In Australia, A Little Bit of Fry & Laurie: Series One Episodes 1–3 (Comedy Bites) was released on 4 March 2010. All four series of A Bit of Fry & Laurie are available on Netflix and for digital download from several sources. All four series, and the pilot, of A Bit of Fry & Laurie are available to stream on Amazon's Prime Video service. === DVD release dates === Series DVD No. of Episodes Year Release Date Region 1 Region 2 Region 4 Complete Series 1 6 1987 & 1989 22 August 2006 3 April 2006 6 July 2006 Complete Series 2 6 1990 22 August 2006 12 June 2006 15 March 2007 Complete Series 3 6 1992 24 July 2007 4 September 2006 4 July 2007 Complete Series 4 7 1995 24 July 2007 30 October 2006 5 March 2008 Complete Series 1–4 25 1987–1995 24 July 2007 30 October 2006 17 August 2006 == Music == Laurie's musical talents featured on the show in the form of plot points in a sketch and satirical songs. The first such song, "Mystery", parodies a mournful love song from a lounge singer (Laurie mimics the vocal mannerisims of Sammy Davis Jr.) and presents the obstacles to a relationship between the singer and the object of affection, which become more outlandish every verse: she lives in a different country, would probably have a problem with the singer's job ("with the Thames Water Authority"), has never actually met and may indeed "take a violent dislike" to the singer, and has been dead since 1973 ("fifteen years come next Jan-uary"). Laurie later played the song when appearing on an episode of Inside the Actors Studio in 2006. His songs include: * "Little Girl": Wearing a false pencil moustache and overly-oiled hair, Laurie, in the role of a child pornographer-celebrity photographer, tells in the style of Noël Coward of how he made an underaged girl famous by seducing and taking wildly erotic pictures of her. Pictures of Page Three girls appear in the background as he sings. As the paparazzo continues to photograph the girl throughout her lifetime, she becomes a singing sensation, marries and divorces a pop singer, and fades out of the public eye. The photographer ends his song by mourning that the "little girl" is no longer little or a girl, but on the bright side, she has a young daughter whom the photographer would very much like to meet. * "America": Laurie dresses in what was, at the time, the standard American rock star "uniform"—flannel, white T-shirt, jeans, sneakers, and a bandana headband in the style of Bruce Springsteen and Jimi Hendrix. Laurie dramatically sings the song, the lyrics of which consist of "...America, America, America..." and "...the States, the States, the States...", until Fry comes on stage, quite annoyed, and punches him. * "The Sophisticated Song": Laurie, in a white and black suit, plays guitar, accompanied by a back-up band, singing about how normally he is very cool until he needs to talk to his true love, at which point he becomes so speechless, he begins to drool. * "The Polite Rap": Prancing around in neon gangsta clothing, Laurie parodies the hip hop culture with this rap telling people to be nice, rather than bad, and that he's a "good-ass motherliker", rather than "bad-ass motherfucker". * "Where is the Lid?": Laurie announces that he has written a "savage, angry" song about "jars that become separated from their lids". Playing the piano, he sings "Where is the lid?" mournfully and repetitively. In the background, Fry finds a stray lid, and tries it on an open jar sitting on the piano; it fits, and he pleads with Laurie to stop singing as the lid has been found and restored to its jar. Laurie ignores Fry and continues to play until Fry punches him. (This is immediately followed by a mini-feature about Laurie's "death".) This song is thematically and musically very similar to "America". * "There Ain't But One Way": Laurie and Fry, dressed as two rednecks, introduce the song. A jibe at American Southern patriotism, Laurie sings about how the only way to solve the world's problems, from the hole in the ozone layer to poverty, is to "kick some ass", while Fry, playing his mentally challenged brother ("the victim of an unfortunate musical accident"), shouts out "yee-hah!" and repeats "kickin' AY-ass!" when sung by Laurie and stomps around, eventually falling offstage. * "I'm in Love with Steffi Graf": Laurie once again has a back-up band while he plays the acoustic guitar, and makes a play at the depressing grunge music of the 1990s. He overdramatically flips the hair out of his eyes in the style of Robert Smith of The Cure and, affecting an effeminate lisp, proclaims his love for tennis player Steffi Graf. He goes so far as to proclaim that he stalked her during her tournaments and finally reveals himself as the man who stabbed Monica Seles as revenge for her defeat of Graf, a big news story in 1993. While the tune is performed, a slideshow of Steffi Graf playing tennis is shown on a projector screen. * "Too Long Johnny": Laurie appears dressed completely in black and wearing a red fedora. He plays slide guitar on a resonator guitar and, affecting a bluesman accent, he sings, "Too long, Johnny, too long, it's way too long", then proceeds to sing/explain about how he wants to cut "it" down to a perfect length. Though Johnny does get "it" down to the perfect length, he claims he made "its" width much too narrow, and must now start all over again. * "Hey Jude": Laurie plays his grand piano and sings "Hey Jude" by The Beatles, in a voice reminiscent of Pinky and Perky. Fry eventually joins him on stage and begins to sing along in an impossibly deep voice. Fry then holds up cue cards so the audience may sing along with the "na na na na" of the refrain. Hugh Laurie played the piano one octave lower than usual while singing normally, this was then transposed one octave up to give a normal sounding piano with a high-pitched voice. * "Love Me Tender": Laurie once again covers a famous musician, this time Elvis Presley. He even adopts a Presley-esque voice for the song. However, Laurie's attempt at seriousness becomes decidedly skewed after the camera pans out, revealing that he is singing to Nicholas Parsons sitting on a stool. Laurie finishes up the song then tenderly kisses the shoulder of Parsons's suit. * "What I Mind": Laurie on piano and accompanied by a backup band sings a country song about hard times with his "girl", who will not stop referring to him as an inanimate object, such as a hoover, a key, and a garage. * "The Protest Song": Laurie again provides himself with a backup band and plays acoustic guitar as well as harmonica. He spoofs American college activist rock, singing about how everyone can make the world a better place. Much like his cover of "Love Me Tender", this song appears to be Laurie's attempt at seriousness, at least until he reaches the part when he must actually sing what everyone is supposed to do to build a better society. Every time he reaches this part, as if unable to think of an actual course of action to save the world, he mumbles incoherently in to the microphone. When he reaches the end of the song, he repeats the line "All we gotta do is..." several times, and then resumes playing the harmonica. He also performed this song on BBC's Comic Relief telethon in 1993, and in 2006 alongside his hosting duties on an edition of Saturday Night Live. == Publications == Four collections of A Bit of Fry and Laurie scripts have been published. * * * * The official authorised Fry & Laurie story, Soupy Twists by Jem Roberts, was published by Unbound in 2018. == References == ==External links== * Comedy Guide * * * * Category:1989 British television series debuts Category:1995 British television series endings Category:1980s British television sketch shows Category:1990s British television sketch shows Category:BBC television sketch shows Category:BBC satirical television shows Category:1980s British satirical television series Category:1990s British satirical television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Stephen Fry

63057847	A Bit of Jade	A Bit of Jade is a 1918 silent comedy-drama film directed by Edward Sloman and starring Mary Miles Minter. As with many of Minter’s features, it is thought to be a lost film.The Library of Congress/FIAF American Silent Feature Film Survival Catalog: A Bit of Jade ==Plot== thumb|Mary Miles Minter and Allan Forrest in "A Bit of Jade" (1918) As described in various film magazine reviews, Phyllis King (Minter) is at lunch in a café one day when her brother Cuthbert (Howard) comes in, and begs her to lend him her money and jewellery to pay a gambling debt. He promises that he will make it up to her with a gift, and as he leaves he accidentally takes an overcoat belonging to Grayson Blair (Forrest), which contains a valuable jade necklace in the pocket. When Phyllis is unable to pay for her lunch as Cuthbert has taken all her money, Blair comes to her rescue. Sometime later, at her aunt's country house, Phyllis and her friends are dressing up in boys' clothes for a lark. Phyllis finds the jade necklace in her brother's coat and, believing it to be the gift her promised her, she puts it on. She then sneaks into a neighbour's boathouse with the intention of borrowing their motorboat, but is caught by Blair. In the ensuing struggle Phyllis escapes but loses both her hat - causing Blair to recognise her as the girl from the café - and the necklace, which Blair retrieves. Phyllis is approached by Rhi (Ferguson), Blair's discharged Hindu manservant, who is trying to reclaim the jade necklace and return it to the temple whence it came. He offers to help Phyllis retrieve the necklace. When Phyllis gets home, she sees a newspaper article with a picture of the necklace, declaring that it has been stolen. Thinking that her brother has stolen it to pay his gambling debts, Phyllis decides that she needs to return it to its rightful owner before her brother can be accused of theft. With the help of Rhi, Phyllis sneaks into Blair's house and tries to take the necklace, but he catches her. However, before he can have her arrested, Rhi enters and attacks Blair. Phyllis and Blair together manage to overpower him, and when Cuthbert enters looking for his sister, Blair recognises his overcoat on Cuthbert, and understands how the necklace had, quite innocently, come to be in Phyllis' possession. The film ends with the promise of romance as Blair places the bit of jade around Phyllis' neck. The June 1918 issue of Photoplay features a detailed fiction adaptation of the film, complete with several stills from the picture. ==Cast== thumb|Lantern slide for "A Bit of Jade" * Mary Miles Minter as Phyllis King * Allan Forrest as Grayson Blair * David Howard as Cuthbert King * Vera Lewis as Mrs. Abigail King * Al Ferguson as Rhi * Clarence Burton as Lantz ==References== ==External links== * Category:1918 comedy-drama films Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1918 films Category:Films directed by Edward Sloman Category:1910s American films Category:1910s English-language films Category:Silent American comedy-drama films

It was produced by Berry Gordy with Hal Davis and Marc Gordon doing the mixing. The Supremes performed the Beatles' "Eight Days a Week" on several television shows including Shindig and Hullabaloo, though the song did not make the album. The album just missed the Top 20 in the U.S., peaking at No. 21. While not quite as prolific as the Beatles, the Supremes enjoyed three albums charting simultaneously in 1964–65. ==Track listing== Side One #"How Do You Do It?"

70207208	A Bit of Previous	A Bit of Previous is the eleventh studio album by Scottish band Belle and Sebastian, released on 6 May 2022 through Matador Records. It was preceded by the singles "Unnecessary Drama", "If They're Shooting at You" and "Young and Stupid". A non-album single, also called "A Bit of Previous", was released in June 2022. ==Background== Belle and Sebastian intended to record A Bit of Previous in Los Angeles until the COVID-19 pandemic forced them to stay in their home city of Glasgow, making the album their first to be recorded there since 1999. The album title is a phrase used by the father of bassist Bobby Kildea to "winkingly acknowledge past relationships", although NME interpreted the title to be a reference to the Buddhist concept of reincarnation in that "you may already have 'previous' with people you meet". ==Critical reception== On review aggregator Metacritic, A Bit of Previous received a score of 78 out of 100 based on 16 critics' reviews, indicating "generally favorable" reception. Quinn Moreland, writing for Pitchfork, felt that the "lyrics share a tight thematic focus" characterised by Belle and Sebastian's "clear, aphoristic language", although musically, "A Bit of Previous touches on a little bit of everything". Gary Ryan of NME highlighted the "universally lovely melodies and earworm choruses" and concluded that "All of the well-worn Belle and Sebastian hallmarks are present, but what's truly impressive is how effortless it all sounds this time around." Steve Erickson characterised the album as an "endearingly self-aware nostalgia trip", summarising that it "strikes a balance between the band's familiar sound and proving they still have something to say". Bella Fleming of The Line of Best Fit wrote that due to the circumstance of being recorded in Glasgow it at first appeared "set to be standout, yet ultimately misses the mark". Fleming judged that while "carrying the same overall feel of If You're Feeling Sinister and The Boy With the Arab Strap, it lacks the depth and storytelling brilliance that originally made this band so exciting". Reviewing the album for PopMatters, Hayden Merrick stated that from the first track, A Bit of Previous "refutes the assumption that this is a return-to-form album. [...] Even the album title [...] seems to admit that golden age Belle and Sebastian will have only a bit part in this new release." Merrick felt that the band still only have "some" of what they used to. ==Track listing== ==Charts== Chart performance for A Bit of Previous Chart (2022) Peak position ==References== Category:2022 albums Category:Belle and Sebastian albums Category:Matador Records albums
16171953	A Bit of Singing and Dancing	A Bit of Singing and Dancing is a short story collection by British writer Susan Hill. It was published in 1973 in the United Kingdom and reissued along with In the Springtime of the Year in the United States in 1984. The stories mainly focus on tyranny and freedom. ==Reception== A 1984 book review by Kirkus Reviews of two short story collections by Hill, concluded; "Like Hill's other stories, these are tales of thwarted passions and odd couples—with the mixture of pathos and charm at its best in the title story." The book has been described as "a vivid picture of the loneliness of old age".Ronald Carter and John McRae. The Routledge History of Literature in English: Britain and Ireland.

6310777	A Bit of a Do	A Bit of a Do is a British comedy-drama series based on the books by David Nobbs. The show starred David Jason and Gwen Taylor. It was produced by Yorkshire Television for two series and aired on the ITV network from 13 January to 1 December 1989. The show was set in a fictional Yorkshire town. Each episode took place at a different social function and followed the changing lives of two families, the working-class Simcocks (David Jason, Gwen Taylor, David Thewlis and Wayne Foskett) and the middle-class Rodenhursts (Nicola Pagett, Paul Chapman, Sarah-Jane Holm and Nigel Hastings), together with their respective friends, Rodney and Betty Sillitoe (Tim Wylton and Stephanie Cole), and Neville Badger (Michael Jayston). The series begins with the wedding of Ted and Rita Simcock's son Paul to Laurence and Liz Rodenhurst's daughter Jenny; an event at which Ted and Liz begin an affair. The subsequent fallout from this affair forms the basis for most of the first series. ==Cast== * Ted Simcock (David Jason) – a working class Yorkshireman in his early fifties, Ted claims to be proud of his roots and paints himself as very down-to-earth. However, he clearly aspires to climb the social ladder, constantly boasting about the success of his business, the Jupiter Foundry, at functions (with a running joke being that no one has ever heard of it). Ted's downfall is women, having already had three affairs prior to leaving Rita for Liz. * Rita Simcock (also Spragg) (Gwen Taylor) – Ted's wife, who begins the series as a homely woman lacking in confidence, obsessed by what others will think of her and her family. However, after Ted's desertion she discovers an inner strength, becoming independent and developing an interest in political and social issues, changing her appearance and even becoming a local councillor. * Liz Rodenhurst (née Ellsworth-Smythe; later Badger) (Nicola Pagett) – an attractive, confident and sexually promiscuous woman, Liz is in many ways the polar opposite of Rita; although like Rita, her social standing is her chief concern in life. Her husband Laurence tolerates her affairs as long as she's discreet; a weakness for 'bits of rough' leads her to Ted. A seemingly cold woman, Liz finally shows genuine emotion when she loses her second husband, Neville, in a car crash. * Laurence Rodenhurst (Paul Chapman) – An emotionally repressed, 'stiff upper lip' middle class dentist, Laurence is obsessed with behaving properly and his public image. He seems uninterested in Liz's affairs as long as they don't embarrass him socially, and has high expectations of his children. Most people consider him cold and emotionless, making his suicide after Liz leaves him all the more shocking. * Neville Badger (Michael Jayston) – Laurence's recently widowed oldest friend. A respected lawyer, he finds it impossible to hide his grief over wife Jane's death, and is deeply shamed to have publicly revealed it. He later marries Liz, after which he becomes almost unbearably upbeat about life. He is killed in a car crash (off-screen), his funeral being the focus of the penultimate episode. * Betty Sillitoe (Stephanie Cole) – Rita's oldest friend; a kind and loving woman with two key vices – gossip and alcohol. She tries hard to help her friends but normally makes things worse. She and husband Rodney have a famously happy marriage, and equally famously get drunk alternately at functions. * Rodney Sillitoe (Tim Wylton) – Betty's husband and Ted's oldest friend. Like his beloved wife, Rodney is kind and loving, but let down by his penchant for drink. He owns a battery chicken farm, Cock-a-doodle Chickens, and claims to feel no guilt about this; however, this changes when he is drunk, leading him to feel very depressed. * Jenny Simcock (née Rodenhurst) (Sarah-Jane Holm) – Liz and Laurence's idealistic daughter, whose marriage to Paul Simcock introduces the families. She is deeply concerned by social and political issues such as feminism, poverty and starvation in Africa and is strongly moral; however, she is actually somewhat naive about the real world. She has a complicated love life, entering a relationship with her brother-in- law Elvis after splitting from Paul, later leaving Elvis to reunite with his brother. * Paul Simcock (David Thewlis) – Ted and Rita's younger son; a self- confessed 'great wet slob' until he meets Jenny, and begins to share her political and social concerns. Like Jenny, he is a very intense character whose morals are offended by Ted and Liz's affair; however, he breaks his own code by having a drunken one-night stand with Carol Fordingbridge. Paul is not seen on-screen in series two, but is mentioned in each episode. * Elvis Simcock (Wayne Foskett) – Ted and Rita's elder son. Elvis is a Philosophy graduate and sees himself as very intelligent; however, he finds thinking is not a quality that counts for much when job-hunting. After a short relationship he and Carol (his brother's former lover) become engaged; however, this ends because Elvis constantly makes Carol feel inferior. He later starts a relationship with his sister-in-law Jenny, but eventually loses out to Paul. He has a tempestuous relationship with Jenny's brother Simon, the two frequently arguing due to their opposing world views, but at times there are signs a friendship will develop. * Simon Rodenhurst (Nigel Hastings) – Liz and Laurence's son, he's adored by Liz, but has a more difficult relationship with his father. A successful estate agent but a flop with women, he frequently clashes with cynical philosopher Elvis, who sees Simon as morally bankrupt. After his first sexual encounter results in an unplanned pregnancy (with Neville's nephew's wife being the mother) Simon turns to celibacy, but changes his mind after he meets Lucinda Snellmarsh, an equally ill-at-ease estate agent. * Carol Fordingbridge (Karen Drury) – Laurence's former receptionist who has a one-night stand with Paul. After starting a job at Cock-a-doodle Chickens, Carol becomes engaged to Elvis. Although attractive and outgoing, Carol lacks confidence in her intellect, particularly as Elvis seems embarrassed by her (later causing them to split up). Initially disliked by Rita because of her role in Paul and Jenny's break-up, Carol becomes something of her protege, and begins retaking her A Levels as a result of her encouragement. * Sandra Pickersgill (later Simcock) (Tracy Brabin) – A good- hearted but notoriously clumsy waitress who begins a relationship with Ted, despite an age gap of over twenty years. She's down-to-earth and doesn't share Ted's desire to impress socially. She's devastated when Ted ends things with her to marry Corinna; however, she eventually forgives him and becomes his second wife in the final episode. * Lucinda Snellmarsh (Amanda Wenban) – Simon's girlfriend (and later fiancée) from series two onwards. Like him, she's a socially awkward estate agent; however, when Simon loses his job she proves surprisingly assertive in rescuing his career. * Geoffrey Ellsworth- Smythe (later Spragg) (Malcolm Tierney) – Liz's brother; an anthropologist who returns to the UK after over twenty years in Africa and, to Liz's horror, begins a relationship with Rita. He and Liz are not close and he doesn't share her snobbery. He takes Rita's maiden name at their marriage. * Corinna Price- Rodgerson (Diana Weston) – an upper-class, sophisticated businesswoman who sets her sights on Ted, breaking up his relationship with Sandra. She persuades Ted they should open a restaurant in Africa; however, on the night of their farewell party she is arrested at the airport and revealed to be a con artist, real name Mavis Stant. * Gerry Lansdowne (David Yelland) – an ambitious young politician who begins a relationship with older woman Rita after her marriage break-up. Rita jilts him on their wedding day after realising she will come second to his political aspirations. * Eric Sidall (Malcolm Hebden) – a camp, over-talkative barman at The Angel Hotel, who frequently attempts to engage the regulars in long-winded stories, usually involving his 'ex-brother-in-law from Falkirk'. In the novels, the role of barman alternates between Eric and another barman, Alec Skiddaw - but while Alec is mentioned by name in the TV series, only Eric appears, with his personality combining elements of both characters from the books. * Percy and Clarrie Spragg (Keith Marsh and Maggie Jones) – Rita's parents. Rita is frequently embarrassed by her father's coarse behaviour, which he in turn plays up to. However, he genuinely loves his daughter, and she is touched by his anger at Ted's behaviour. Rita is devastated when Percy dies in her arms on the dancefloor; Clarrie later dies off-screen in hospital. * Andrew Denton (Philip Bird) – Neville's nephew, well known for making unfunny or inappropriate quips and following them with 'Joke!', usually to the annoyance or bemusement of his audience. He proudly celebrates his wife Judy's pregnancy, having previously believed he was sterile, unaware that the real father is Simon. ==Episode list== ===Series 1 (1989)=== ===Series 2 (1989)=== ==Background== Pat Sandys who had produced one of David Nobbs' plays Cupid's Darts was looking for plays for a series called Love and Marriage. The three ideas put forward by David Nobbs were a dentists' dinner dance, a Miss Ball Bearing competition and a diamond wedding. Though the ideas were not used, David Nobbs came up with the idea of having the same characters in different do's. Casting Gwen Taylor as Rita came first. David Nobbs wanted John Thaw and several others to play Ted Simcock, before David Jason was chosen. The church seen in cartoon form in the opening title sequence is St John the Baptist Church in the town centre of Knaresborough, North Yorkshire. The lead spire with a criss-cross pattern and with a cockerel weather vane on top, and the clock with curved wording above it, both match between the drawing and the real church. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1980s British drama television series Category:1989 British television series debuts Category:1989 British television series endings Category:ITV comedy-dramas Category:Television series by ITV Studios Category:Television series by Yorkshire Television Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in Yorkshire
38695098	A Bit of a Test	thumb|right|Aldwych Theatre in 2006 A Bit of a Test is a farce by Ben Travers. It was the last, and least successful, of the series of twelve Aldwych farces that ran in uninterrupted succession at the Aldwych Theatre in London from 1923 to 1933. The play depicts the efforts of the England cricket captain to keep his star batsman out of trouble during an Ashes series in Australia. The piece opened on 30 January 1933 and ran until 3 June, a total of 142 performances."Mr. Ralph Lynn", The Times, 10 August 1962, p. 11 ==Background== The actor-manager Tom Walls had produced, directed and co-starred in nine Aldwych farces between 1923 and 1932. By the early 1930s his interest was moving from theatre to cinema, and though he produced the last three farces in the series he did not appear in them. Ben Travers, who had written all but three of the series, made no attempt to write Walls-type roles for another actor to play. Ralph Lynn, who had co-starred with Walls in the earlier farces, became the sole star for Dirty Work, Fifty-Fifty and A Bit of a Test."Aldwych Theatre", The Times, 8 March 1932, p. 12 By 1933 some regular members of the Aldwych company had left, but there remained Lynn, in his customary "silly ass" roles, Robertson Hare, as a figure of put-upon respectability; Mary Brough as a good-hearted battle-axe; and the saturnine Gordon James.Trussler, p. 278 Travers was a passionate devotee of cricket. In the wake of the controversial "Bodyline" series in Australia, he thought the general public would welcome a farce about the game.Ben Travers interview, Brian Johnston, BBC Test Match Special, 1980 The British public was reasonably receptive, but the Australian public was not. Touring productions of the Aldwych farces had generally done well in Australia, but A Bit of a Test closed within four nights of opening in Melbourne."New Play Withdrawn", The Argus, 11 May 1933, p. 7 Travers commented that the Australians had a faulty sense of humour about themselves, particularly where cricket was concerned. "A sense of humor might have enabled the cricket controversy to have been avoided.""Ben Travers Explains Failure of A Bit of a Test", The Advertiser, 12 May 1933, p. 21 ==Original cast== *Ben Craggs – Frederick Burtwell *Gilbert Augustus Pogson – Robertson Hare *"Dandy" Stratton – Ralph Lynn *Colin Chilcote – Cameron Carr *Sylvia Dale – Renée Gadd *Mrs Rusby – Mary Brough *Mrs Dunwiddy – Maidie Hope *Rosemary Dunwiddy – Joan Brierley *Schneider – E Louis Bradfield *Old Dale – Gordon James *Peters – William Collins *Superintendent Barker – Charles Farrell *PC Peck – Hyde White ==Synopsis== Pogson, the captain of the English cricket team, is desperate to keep his star batsman, Stratton, in good form. At the close of the first day of the Brisbane test match, Stratton's score is 72 not out. His cricketing talent is offset, in Pogson's view, by his playboy habits. He has caused consternation by bringing a girlfriend, Sylvia Dale, into the dressing room, and Pogson is even more concerned when he learns that Stratton intends to drive out overnight to the Dale family's bungalow in the outback. Stratton, ever gallant, wishes to protect Sylvia's grandfather from a threatened attack by local bandits. Pogson reluctantly sets off in pursuit, accompanied by the dauntless Mrs Rusby. At the bungalow, old Dale is held up by the bandits; Stratton and Sylvia engage them in combat, in which Pogson joins. While battle rages, Mrs Rusby leaps into the saddle and rides off to fetch the police. When they arrive, Stratton, who has laid out the bandits with a crowbar, sets about the police, not realising who they are. The next morning, back in Brisbane, Stratton seems to be in such serious trouble with the police that there is little hope that Pogson can get him to the crease to resume his innings. The police, however, put cricket before minor infringements of law and order, and Stratton and Pogson get to the ground in time. ==Critical reception== The Times thought the running battle in the second act highly effective, but found that the resolution of the plot in the last act was too slow and not comic enough."Aldwych Theatre", The Times, 31 January 1933, p. 8 Ivor Brown in The Observer also thought the second act the highlight: "essential, victorious Aldwych nonsense. O rare Ben Travers!"Brown Ivor, "Aldwych – A Bit of a Test", The Observer, 5 February 1933, p. 14 The Manchester Guardian commented, "The Aldwych Gentlemen v. Players can hold their own even on that tricky wicket the financial state of the London theatres in 1933.""An Aldwych Farce in White Flannels – A Bit of a Test", The Manchester Guardian, 31 January 1933, p. 8 ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1933 plays Category:Aldwych farce Category:Comedy plays Category:Plays by Ben Travers
72608739	A Bit of the Roman Aqueduct	A Bit of the Roman Aqueduct is a landscape painting by American painter George Inness. It was completed by the artist in 1852, likely in his studio in New York City. However, some scholarship suggests the possibility that Inness at least began work on the painting while in Italy the year before.Dion, Judy.

The painting is held in the collections of the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, Georgia, where it is currently not on view.The collections of the High Museum of Art; Atlanta, Georgia; https://high.org/collections/a-bit-of- the-roman-aqueduct; retrieved Dec. 26, 2022. == Context == George Inness enjoyed a strong and early start to his artistic career. Starting as a teenager, Inness studied under multiple artists around New York City, such as John Jesse Barker and, later, Régis Gignoux. He debuted at the National Academy of Design in 1844 at nineteen years of age. Founded a generation prior by some of the preeminent artists of the Hudson River School such as Thomas Cole and Asher Durand, the Academy steeped the young Inness in the contemporary orthodoxy of American landscape painting.Dunlap, William, Frank W. Bayley, and Charles E. Goodspeed. A History of the Rise and Progress of the Arts of Design in the United States, Vol III. C.E. Goodspeed & Co., 1918, pp. 53–57. Retrieved on Google Books, Jan. 5, 2023. Inness would go on to open his first studio in New York City in 1848, at which point he began accepting patronages and commissions from the public. Contemporary counterpart Arthur Hoeber wrote of Inness's early success that "in truth he was really never without a serious patronage almost from the beginning."Daingerfield, Elliot and Arthur Hoeber. An Exhibition of Eighteen Pictures by the American Master of Landscape Painting, the late George Inness, N.A.. The Art Institute of Chicago, 1911, p. 5. Retrieved on Hathi Trust, Feb. 17, 2023. Inness received funding for his first voyage abroad through his patron, New York merchant Ogden Haggerty, in 1851.Gardner, James; "George Inness's Italian Days"; The Magazine Antiques: March/April 2011, Vol. 178 Issue 2, pp. 110–115, 113; . This would be the first of three journeys that Inness would make to Europe during his artistic career.Roberts, Norma J. (1988); The American Collections: The Columbus Museum of Art, p. 6; https://archive.org/details/americancollecti0000colu/page/6/mode/2up, Retrieved Dec. 26, 2022. Beginning in 1851, Inness took up residence in Rome for fifteen months, where he primarily studied the works and techniques of 17th-century masters such as Nicolas Poussin and Salvator Rosa. He rented a studio in Rome that was said to have been used by French landscape painter Claude Lorrain, as well as its more recent prior resident, Thomas Cole, who had reportedly used the space while on a European tour a decade prior in 1842.Gardner 2011, p. 113. His inspiration from these studies would lead Inness to deviate from his American roots in the Hudson River School, known for its depictions of nature as being wild and imperfect. Rather, Inness would pursue a more idyllic and poetic approach to depicting nature, some of the first stages of such experimentation being seen in A Bit of the Roman Aqueduct and other works he produced during and following this first trip to Europe. Inness's style would go on to evolve through multiple additional stages throughout his life, arriving finally at a signature haziness for which the artist would be most known.Alspaugh, Leann Davis. "George Inness: Gifts from Frank and Katherine Martucci." New Criterion. September 2013. Vol 32, Issue 1, pp. 49–51. Retrieved Jan. 25, 2023. https://newcriterion.com/issues/2013/9/exhibition-note-7692. == Composition == thumb|Landscape with Cattle and Peasants, painted by Claude Lorrain in 1629. Here can be seen a similar use of billowing vegetation framing the background in contrast to activity in the foreground, as well as similar themes of shepherds with cattle in a rural scene. Most of A Bit of the Roman Aqueduct is dominated by towering foliage, which establishes the middle ground and frames the more distant background in contrast to the activity in the foreground. These bulging, verdant trees are the most striking example of the influence that the works of the 17th-century landscape painters, which Inness was studying while in Rome, had on the artist and his artistic product in this period.Gardner 2011, p. 113. A comparison has been made to Lorrain's Landscape with Cattle and Peasants, showing a clear inspiration for Inness's own work in the motifs and techniques of Lorrain.Mitchell, Mark D. George Inness in Italy Bulletin. The Philadelphia Museum of Art, 2011, p. 19. . Retrieved Jan. 25, 2023, via JSTOR The foreground of the painting is host to its dynamic movement. This comes in the form of a pair of Italian shepherds leading their cattle to the stream that runs from the bottom-right corner of the canvas, through the trees, and eventually out of view into the background.Bell, Adrienne Baxter. "George Inness and the Unfinished Painting"; The Magazine Antiques: November 2003, Vol. 164 Issue 5, pp. 108–115, 109; . Along the near- sided bank of this stream is a felled log, the gnarled branches of which extend out over the water. This appears as a vestige of Inness's origins in the Hudson River School, which depicted natural features as being more rugged. This log contrasts with the commanding trees overhead, which are painted much more in the idealized style of the 17th-century French landscapists.Mitchell 2011, p. 19. The background is visible only through the gap in the middle ground's foliage. Continuing farther and farther into the distance, the background is composed of multiple layers that eventually reach the horizon of the painting. The foremost of these layers depicts a stone bridge that appears to cross over the same stream flowing through the foreground. Beyond this, a second layer of the background shows a plain with vegetation that is bisected by the aqueduct for which the painting is named. The arches of the aqueduct are so small as to be barely visible, alluding to the historical distance of Rome's ancient achievements. Completing the background is a final distant layer of rising land formations, beginning with sloping hills and eventually giving way to distant mountains.Mitchell 2011, p. 19. == References == Category:1852 paintings Category:Landscape paintings Category:Oil on canvas paintings

51562630	A Bitter Draught	"A Bitter Draught" is the second episode of the sixth season of the American fantasy drama series Once Upon a Time, which aired on October 2, 2016. In this episode, when a mysterious person surfaces in Storybrooke to seek vengeance, Regina, David and Snow band together to stop him, Emma turns to Archie to find out why she continues to have visions of her future, The Evil Queen attempts to win Zelena over, and Hook agrees to help Belle protect her and unborn child from Gold. Flashbacks show The Count of Monte Cristo being hired by the Queen to kill Snow and Charming. ==Plot== ===Opening sequence=== The Dark Palace is shown in the forest. ===Event chronology=== * The 19th Century France events takes place a few years after Edmond's imprisonment. * The Enchanted Forest events take place during "The Cricket Game", after the Evil Queen's cancelled execution and before Snow White and Prince Charming's wedding day in "Pilot". * The Storybrooke events take place after "The Savior". ===In the Characters' Past=== In 19th Century France, Edmond Dantès, also known as the Count of Monte Cristo, is hosting a ceremony at his palace. He then walks over to the person who locked him up ten years earlier, the Baron, and he kills him for revenge. Everyone flees except for the Evil Queen, who offers the Count a list of every person who has ever wronged him or his fiancée, for the sake of revenge, and in return she asks for help with revenge of her own. Later on the Enchanted Forest, Snow and David come across a ramsacked village with Snow White's handmaiden Charlotte and Grumpy. Here they encounter Edmond, who is pretending to be a lone survivor. He is in reality working with the Evil Queen, who wants him to poison Snow and David. Unfortunately, Rumplestiltskin shows up and warns The Queen that he placed a protection spell on the Charmings, but the Queen also placed a protection spell on Edmond so he won't be killed by Rumplestiltskin. At the Charmings' palace, Edmond reluctantly goes through with the plan, but soon feels guilty when Snow’s handmaiden Charlotte joins them, prompting Edmond to back out of the plan to poison them. Later on, Rumplestiltskin appears to talk to Edmond, who admits that Charlotte reminds him of his fiancée, and decides to poison her, as Rumple cannot kill Edmond. However, the poison does not kill Charlotte immediately. Rumple convinces Edmond to take Charlotte with him and go to a different realm called the Land of Untold Stories, and promises him that as long as he and Charlotte stay there, the poison will not kill her. Edmond accepts the offer and leaves. ===In Storybrooke=== That night at the vault, The Evil Queen and Zelena entered the place despite the protection spell placed on it. Hoping that it will make Regina suffer, The Evil Queen tells Zelena that "She can never escape who she really is.” She then takes a box that will be useful in her plans. Later on the following night, The Evil Queen congratulated Zelena on not letting Regina know about her arrival in Storybrooke despite Zelena's mixed feelings. Speaking of Regina, she visits Granny's the following day and helps the residents welcome the newcomers, when suddenly a person who is revealed to be Edmond shows up to give Henry a letter to hand to Snow and David. When Regina recognized who they were taking about, she tells Snow and David that she hired him to finish the job of killing them back in the Enchanted Forest. When they visit his room, they discovered an arsenal of weapons ready to use. At the wreckage in the forest, Regina confronted Edmond to call it off but he refuses, then pulls his sword to strike at Regina, only to have Regina use magic to stop it and he disappeared. At the same time Emma attempted to get Snow and David out of Storybrooke only to discover that someone placed a barrier on the city limits. When Regina discovers this, she asked Zelena about it but tells her sister she had nothing to do with it. When Regina and Henry return to the wreckage, they encountered Charlotte's body and discovered that she was poisoned. The two are then confronted by the Evil Queen, who also weakened Regina's powers and revealed that she is controlling Edmond by using his heart to kill the Charmings. At the docks, Edmond shows up to fight Snow and David, and knocked them out after he tells them that the Evil Queen was alive. Just as he about finish them, Regina stops him and challenges Edmond to a sword fight. Regina is still weakened and Henry's phone is blocked by a spell after he gets the upper hand, when Regina throws the sword at Edmond and kills him. Suddenly The Evil Queen arrived to warn everyone that they all have untold stories and it's about to be played out and Regina will be the undoing, as she used Regina's psyche to kill Edmond. Later that night, everyone gathers at Granny's to come with a strategy to stop the threat. Emma is taking some time out to see Archie about the visions she has been seeing and her tremors from her hand. Emma asked Archie about whether she should tell her family about this but is fretting to point of walking out of his therapy session. When she returned later on, she told Archie about the Evil Queen but then added that her visions are starting to suggest that the only family member who didn't show up in her vision was Regina and is not sure why. With Belle returning to Storybrooke, she asks for a safe place to stay and get away from Gold, so she takes refuge on Hook's ship. Gold on the other hand, is confronted by the Evil Queen, who agrees not to harm Belle or the unborn baby in order to get what she wants, but tells Gold that Belle might not return to him by using a flirtatious gesture on him. Gold then gives a coin to The Evil Queen, who has something in mind for it. At the diner that night, David sees a note on the stool and opens to find the coin. He then walks out to find the Evil Queen ready to talk to him, saying that coin belonged to his late father, only to add that his father's death wasn't an accident. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== The episode saw a slight decrease from the previous outing, with a 1.1/4 rating among 18-49s and 3.67 million viewers tuning in."TV Ratings Sunday: ‘Madam Secretary’ and ‘Elementary’ return lower, FOX gets NFL bump" from TV By The Numbers/Zap2It (October 3, 2016) ===Reviews=== Justin Kirkland of Entertainment Weekly gave the episode a positive review."Once Upon a Time premiere recap: A Bitter Draught'" from Entertainment Weekly (October 2, 2016) ==References== == External links == * Category:2016 American television episodes Category:Once Upon a Time (season 6) episodes

The episode was written by Megan Mostyn-Brown and directed by Louis Shaw-Milito. It was first broadcast in November 16, 2015 in FOX. In this episode, Tabitha sends a group of hitmen to kill Gordon after Galavan's arrest. Gordon and Barnes investigate Galavan's penthouse for clues until they're ambushed by Tabitha's hitmen. The episode was watched by 4.35 million viewers and received positive reviews, with critics praising Gordon's storyline and Penguin's and Nygma's dynamic chemistry but Bruce's storyline was criticized for no plot advancement. ==Plot== Tabitha (Jessica Lucas) arrives at a bar where she enters an underground illegal casino run by a woman known as The Lady (Michelle Gomez). Tabitha offers money in exchange for killing Gordon (Benjamin McKenzie) after the arrest of Galavan (James Frain). Gordon is notified in the hospital that Barbara (Erin Richards) will survive and be transferred to Arkham Asylum. Elsewhere, Cobblepot (Robin Lord Taylor) wakes up in Nygma's (Cory Michael Smith) apartment. When he begins to panic, Nygma sedates him to sleep again. Bruce (David Mazouz) tries to get the information about his parents' killer from Silver (Natalie Alyn Lind), but is stopped by Alfred (Sean Pertwee), who asks Silver to leave. Silver gives Bruce her hotel key. Lee and Gordon's relationship gets tense after Lee watched Gordon kiss Barbara during the interrogation. While in the elevator to Galavan's penthouse, Gordon is attacked by a hitman, Billy Boy (Jon Sklaroff), but he manages to defeat him. Finding out he failed, The Lady sends more hitmen to kill Gordon. When Billy Boy regains consciousness, Gordon asks him who sent him. When Billy doesn't reveal anything, Gordon nearly throws him from the penthouse until he is stopped by Barnes (Michael Chiklis). While Barnes chastises Gordon, hitmen arrive at the penthouse. The unarmed forensics officer, standing guard at the door, is killed by a hitman entering from the stairs. The hitmen enter the penthouse and a gun battle begins. The officers appear to kill all of the hitmen, but in the chaos, Billy Boy frees himself and takes Officer Parks (Ashlei Sharpe Chestnut) hostage. Gordon shoots him in the eye, using his round glasses frame as a bullseye. Gordon and Barnes discover a hidden monk's cassock of Galavan's, but, before they can investigate its meaning, an only injured hitman regains consciousness and stabs Barnes in the leg, prompting Barnes to shoot him in the stomach. The Lady then sends another hitman, Eduardo Flamingo (Raúl Castillo) to kill Gordon. Cobblepot wakes up again and tries to leave, but Nygma prevents him from doing so, stating he's a wanted man for the attempted murder of Galavan. Cobblepot begins to feel guilty after having failed to protect his mother. Nygma tries to help him by offering him a captured associate of Galavan, Leonard, to kill, as retaliation for the murder of his mother. Cobblepot refuses and sobs in the bed. They bond together over the respective deaths of their loved ones. Nygma says having no one whom they love makes them free, because they cannot be threatened. They decide to have fun with Leonard. The police officers arrive but they're killed by Flamingo. Gordon, seeing this on the closed circuit TV, goes down to the street below, and is attacked by Flamingo. Although Flamingo gets the upper hand, Gordon defeats him. Gordon can't make himself kill Flamingo and arrests him. However, at the GCPD, Flamingo bites Parks' neck and she later dies from blood loss. Selina (Camren Bicondova) visits Bruce and convinces him she has enough proof about Silver. Tabitha visits Galavan in jail, where Galavan expresses his anger for hiring hitmen, when he expressly told her to do nothing, and states that if she does it again, he'll kill her. Later that night, the religious sect of the Galavans arrive in Gotham City where they're greeted by Father Creel (Ron Rifkin). They then kill a patrol officer when he sees them and begin to advance to Gotham City. ==Production== ===Casting=== Michelle Gomez was announced to guest star in this episode just two days before the episode aired. According to her, the episode may not be her only appearance in the show. This is the first episode in the series where Donal Logue doesn't appear as Harvey Bullock. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== The episode was watched by 4.35 million viewers with a 1.4/4 share among adults aged 18 to 49. This was an increase in viewership from the previous episode, which was watched by 4.11 million viewers. This made Gotham the most watched program of the day in FOX, beating Minority Report. With Live+7 DVR viewing factored in, the episode had an overall rating of 6.79 million viewers, and a 2.6 in the 18–49 demographic. ===Critical reviews=== "Rise of the Villains: A Bitter Pill to Swallow" received mostly positive reviews from critics. The episode received a rating of 77% with an average score of 7.6 out of 10 on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with the site's consensus stating: "Gotham gives Jim Gordon some much-needed depth in 'A Bitter Pill to Swallow,' although the surrounding stories are less cohesive." Matt Fowler of IGN gave the episode a "great" 8 out 10 and wrote in his verdict, "Aside from the Bruce being "grounded" story, this week's 'A Bitter Pill to Swallow' was really, and violently, eventful. It even contained a moment - the death of Parks - that topped Jerome's slaughter of all those GCPD cops months back. Whether or not it was something you were comfortable watching however is another issue. Also, I enjoyed Barnes opening up more as a character and the Riddler/Penguin pairing quite a bit." The A.V. Club's Kyle Fowle gave the episode a "C+" grade and wrote, "The problem with using 'Rise Of The Villains' as this season's subtitle is that it's such a generic phrase as to be virtually meaningless. Wasn't last season also about the rise of the villains? And which villains are we talking about, anyway? If a subtitle is to have any use at all, it’s to bring some sort of focus to the proceedings, but since almost anything that happens on Gotham can fall under that heading, the show is just as prone to sprawl as it has been from the beginning. Tonight's storylines are connected inasmuch as they all spring from Galavan's presence in Gotham, but since he is barely glimpsed until the episode's final minutes, 'A Bitter Pill To Swallow' still feels like a disparate collection of stories in search of a center. ==References== == External links == * Category:Gotham (season 2) episodes Category:2015 American television episodes
2411357	A Bittersweet Life	A Bittersweet Life (; lit. "The Sweet Life") is a 2005 South Korean neo-noir action drama film written and directed by Kim Jee-woon. It stars Lee Byung-hun as Sun-woo, a hitman who becomes targeted by his boss after he spares the latter's cheating mistress. The film was released theatrically in South Korea on 1 April 2005. It opened on 265 screens throughout the country, and registered a total of 1,112,950 admissions by the end of its run. It was also screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. A 30 seconds longer director's cut was later released, featuring slight cutting and re- arrangement of scenes, swapping of music placement and some additional scenes that do not appear in the theatrical cut. The film received an unofficial Indian remake titled Awarapan in 2007. ==Plot== Kim Sun-woo (Lee Byung-hun) is a high-ranking enforcer and loyal subordinate of crime boss Kang (Kim Yeong- cheol). The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Dae-sik (Hwang Jung-min), a son from a rival family. Previously Sun-woo had beaten up Baek's men for overstaying their welcome at their nightclub. Kang, preparing to leave on a business trip, assigns Sun-woo to shadow his young mistress Hee-soo (Shin Min-ah), whom he fears is having an "affair" with another man. As Sun-woo performs his duty — following Hee-soo, and escorting her to a music recital - he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become prevalent. When he does come to discover Hee-soo and her lover at her home, he beats up the man and prepares to inform Kang. However, he changes his mind and spares the two on the condition that they no longer see each other again, earning him Hee-soo's enmity. Later, a man asks Sun-woo to apologize for beating up Baek's men, but he refuses. Agitated, he gets drunk in his apartment, and is kidnapped by Baek's henchmen. They prepare to kill him, but Kang saves him with a phone call. Kang, who has learned of his attempted cover-up of Hee-soo's affair, questions his motive, but he doesn't answer. Kang orders his men to torture Sun-woo, but gives him a chance to fix his mistake. Instead, Sun-woo escapes and vows revenge. Sun-woo delivers Hee-soo a farewell gift, then attempts to buy a handgun. The deal goes bad and he ends up killing the arms dealers. This incurs a vendetta with the brother of one of the dealers, who goes to the nightclub he works at. Sun- woo lures Baek to an ice rink and kills him, getting injured in the process. Undeterred, he arrives at the night club and kills his way in. Confronting Kang, Sun-woo vents over how badly he has been treated despite his years of loyalty. Receiving no justification, Sun-woo kills Kang. Baek's henchmen, who have been trailing Sun-woo, shoot at him and Kang's henchmen. Sun-woo emerges as the only survivor of the battle, just as the arms dealer's brother appears. Bleeding profusely, Sun-woo recalls watching Hee-soo's music recital. That was the only time he was seen smiling. The arms dealer's brother then executes him. The film ends with a continuation of an earlier scene, where Sun-woo looks out of a window at the city below him. After making sure he's alone, he begins to shadowbox his reflection in the glass, looking very happy. ==Cast== *Lee Byung-hun as Kim Sun-woo *Kim Yeong-cheol as Mr. Kang *Shin Min-ah as Moon Hee-soo *Kim Roi-ha as Mun Suk *Lee Ki-young as Oh Mu-sung *Oh Dal-su as Myung-goo *Kim Hae-gon as Tae-woong *Kim Han as Se-yoon *Jin Goo as Min-gi *Jeon Gook-hwan as President Baek *Kim Sung-oh as Oh Mu-sung's subordinate *Jung Yu-mi as Mi-ae ===Special appearance=== *Hwang Jung-min as Baek Dae-sik *Eric Mun as Tae-goo ==Soundtrack== The A Bittersweet Life original soundtrack was released on April 7, 2005. ==Box office and critical reception== The film was screened out of competition at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival. The film at the time had the highest price when its distribution rights were sold to Japan for . Critical reception was highly positive, with critics describing it as "organic, essential, beautifully staged and refreshingly realistic." Derek Elley from Variety magazine described the film as "a tour de force of noirish style and Korean ultra-violence that will have genre fans nailed to their seats." Sam Toy from Empire stated Lee "puts in a star-making performance as the brutal chief whip-turned-fugitive, never overplaying what could easily become hammy and clichéd, and easily holds this Korean noir together." He added "this is hugely enjoyable, and beautifully brutal." Lee Byung-hun was praised for his acting ability with a critic from Cinema Eye saying that he "brings sheer excitement in his performance" and is "an angel dressed in vengeance." The critic also noted that A Bittersweet Life is "the best film of 2005." A critic from BeyondHollywood.com gave the film 4/5 stars.

This release has sold 161,400 copies as of March 2017. ==Critical reception== Bruce Eder of AllMusic writes, "The best- recorded Roy Orbison live disc ever issued, taken from the soundtrack of the HBO concert from the 1980s with VIP guests like Bruce Springsteen and Elvis Costello. This was a sort of magical video, and the performances are splendid, along with the good feelings involved." Grant Britt of American Songwriter also thinks this album rates 4 out of 5 stars and calls Black and White Night, "one of the best rock shows ever filmed." No Depression's review, also by Grant Britt, begins with, "The voice grabs you and won't let go. It’s impossible to duplicate, a soaring, ethereal instrument that swoops and dips with a range few humans ever get within earshot of. Roy Orbison was a musical God, his songwriting skills just as awe-inspiring as his vocal abilities. His legacy endures with a wealth of recorded material, but nothing eclipses 1987’s Black and White Night" Ryan Reed writes for Rolling Stone, "In a backstage interview, Costello called Orbison "the greatest," explaining how he learned about the singer's music second-hand through the Beatles." Gary Graff reviews the album for Billboard and writes, "The Black & White Night show was a pivotal event during Roy Orbison's late '80s comeback. Preceding his involvement with the all-star Traveling Wilburys band (Orbison, George Harrison, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty and Jeff Lynne), the show put a spotlight on Orbison's classic hits with help from Elvis Presley's TCB Band and guests Bruce Springsteen, Elvis Costello, Bonnie Raitt, k.d.

4691395	A Black Box	A Black Box is the ninth studio album by Peter Hammill, originally released on S-Type Records in August 1980. Hammill performed nearly all the instrumentation himself, including the drum parts, a task he had first undertaken on his previous album pH7. His ex-Van der Graaf Generator colleague David Jackson also made a guest appearance, along with David Ferguson of the new-wave band Random Hold, whose debut album Hammill had produced. Side 1 of the record featured a collection of songs, while side 2 was devoted to "Flight", a lengthy multi-section song. This was the first time Hammill had included a lengthy song of this type on one of his solo albums. The short- lived S-Type label (the name was a pun on "stereo-type"), on which the album was originally released, was set up by Hammill and his then manager Gail Colson. Colson had formerly been a director at Hammill's previous record company, Charisma Records, who had dropped him from their roster just prior to the recording of A Black Box. The S-Type label does not appear to have been a successful business project, and the album was later licensed to Virgin Records, who have since also acquired Hammill's Charisma catalogue. == Track listing == All songs written by Peter Hammill, except where noted. == Personnel == *Peter Hammill – vocals, guitar, keyboards, drums, bass *David Jackson – saxophone, flute on 4 and 8 *David Ferguson – synthesizer and tambourine on 4, 6 and 7 === Technical === *Peter Hammill - recording engineer (Sofa Sound, Wiltshire) *David Lord – mixing (Crescent Studios, Bath) ==References== Category:Peter Hammill albums Category:1980 albums

We Role Deep is written across the top.|Official season 2 promotional poster. In the summer of 2018, Robin Thede invited her close friends and fellow comedians Quinta Brunson, Ashley Nicole Black, and Gabrielle Dennis to help her develop a comedy series. Thede then pitched the series to HBO as a way to address the dearth of Black women's representation in the American comedic landscape. Thede was encouraged by HBO executives to push boundaries and take risks with the show. The show was originally titled The Black Lady Sketch Show but the name was changed to communicate to audiences that the series is a single representation of Black women in comedy. The show is thought to be the first sketch comedy series written, produced by, and starring Black women. On January 28, 2019, it was announced that HBO had ordered a half-hour sketch show, A Black Lady Sketch Show, written and created by Robin Thede. Issa Rae is the co-executive producer with Thede through Issa Rae Productions, known as Hoorae as of 2021. The season one director is Dime Davis. Season two was directed by Lacey Duke and Brittany Scott Smith. Bridget Murphy Stokes is the third season's director. On August 27, 2019, HBO announced that A Black Lady Sketch Show had been renewed for a second season. Filming of the second season was put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but on March 23, 2021 it was announced that the six-episode season would premiere on April 23, 2021. On May 24, 2021, HBO renewed the series for a third season. On June 2, 2022, HBO renewed the series for a fourth season. === Casting === thumb|200px|alt=Official season 4 promotional poster shows the cast members in various costumes, Photoshopped together in a room with high ceilings and wooden walls.|Official season 4 promotional poster.

Angela Bassett, Gina Torres, and Marsai Martin were announced as three guest stars. On March 23, 2021, it was announced that Brunson would not appear in season 2 due to scheduling conflicts. Additional changes for season 2 included the casting of Laci Mosley and Skye Townsend as main cast members. Confirmed guest stars include Gabrielle Union, Jesse Williams, Miguel, Skai Jackson, Laz Alonso, Omarion, Kim Wayans, Ayesha Curry, Lance Gross, and Wunmi Mosaku. On March 2, 2022, it was announced that Mosley would not appear in season 3 due to scheduling conflicts. Guest appearances include Ava DuVernay, Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, Raven-Symoné, Wanda Sykes, David Alan Grier, Kyla Pratt, Jemele Hill, and Holly Robinson Peete. New cast members Angel Laketa Moore, DaMya Gurley and Tamara Jade were announced for season 4 on March 21, 2023. === Writers === Lauren Ashley Smith was the show's head writer for the first two seasons. Additional writers for season one are Brittani Nichols, Rae Sanni, Holly Walker, Amber Ruffin and Akilah Green. Cast member Ashley Nicole Black also wrote for the show. It is the first television series to have a writer's room entirely composed of Black women.

The season three writer's room retained Large and brought on new writers. === Release === The series premiered on August 2, 2019. The second season premiered on April 23, 2021 on HBO and HBO Max. Season three premiered on April 8, 2022. Season four premiered on April 14, 2023. == Reception == === Season one === The first season of A Black Lady Sketch Show received critical acclaim. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season of A Black Lady Sketch Show holds an approval rating of 100%, with an average rating of 8.88/10 based on 20 reviews. The website's consensus reads, "Singular, subversive, and simply hilarious, A Black Lady Sketch Show finds universal humor in specific spaces to craft quick-witted sketches that perfectly showcase Robin Thede and her talented cast." According to review aggregator Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, the first season received an assigned score of 89 out of 100 based on reviews from 7 critics, indicating "universal acclaim." In a review by Ali Barthwell for The A.V. Club, she wrote, "A Black Lady Sketch Show possesses a confidence in its first season that suggests the show is not interested in being chopped up into easily consumable chunks. A Black Lady Sketch Show seems more interested in creating a whimsical, loving world for its leads." Writing for Vulture, Jen Chaney stated: "A Black Lady Sketch Show isn’t just funny. Its sketches are consistently clever and surprising, often concluding with twist endings that add a whole other layer to the jokes that had us rolling a couple of minutes ago." In 2020, the show became the first Black women-led sketch show to receive a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Variety Sketch Series. === Season two === The second season also received positive reception. It holds a score of 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on eight critics' reviews. IndieWire journalist Kristen Lopez said that the season "once again delivers hilarity and absurdity in equal measure." Margaret Lyons of the New York Times wrote that the show "has such a fun ear for specifics and lyricism, and the new season grows seamlessly into itself; the show’s recurring characters are back, and Robin Thede, its star and creator, is as dynamic as ever." Danette Chavez of The A.V. Club noted the show "has an air of reinvention" and "retains the cohesion, rapid-fire energy, and mix of culturally specific and universal humor that made the first season uproarious and a joy to watch." The second season received five Emmy nominations, including Outstanding Variety Sketch Series and Outstanding Writing for a Variety Sketch Series. Daysha Broadway, Stephanie Filo, and Jessica Hernández received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Picture Editing for Variety Programming, the first all-women of color ensemble to receive the award in Emmy history. Season two was named to "best" year-end lists published by Paste, The A.V. Club, The Root, and NPR. === Season three === The season holds a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes based on six critics' reviews. Kristen Baldwin of EW rated the season an A− and hailed it as "consistently, ridiculously funny." Similarly, The A.V. Club's Jenna Scherer described the show: "In its third season, A Black Lady Sketch Show continues to blaze a trail as a show both by and for its titular demographic, unafraid to make cultural references that will gleefully whizz over the heads of white viewers." Scherer also complimented the chemistry of the cast members: "they share such an easy rapport, riffing off each other seemingly effortlessly whether the moment is scripted or improvised." == Awards and nominations == Award Year Category Nominee Result American Cinema Editors Awards 2022 Best Edited Variety Talk/Sketch Show or Special Daysha Broadway, Stephanie Filo, and Jessica Hernández (for "Sister, May I Call You Oshun?")

28784108	A Black Man's Soul	A Black Man's Soul is an instrumental album by musician Ike Turner & the Kings of Rhythm released by Pompeii Records in 1969. == Recording and release == A Black Man's Soul contains songs written by Ike Turner, fellow St. Louis musician Oliver Sain and some others including Rufus Thomas. The album was recorded during Turner's free time while he was touring with then wife Tina Turner as part of the Ike & Tina Turner Revue. All tracks were recorded at various studios in the U.S. between tour dates. The album was released on the Dallas-based label Pompeii in April 1969. It was distributed by London Records in the Netherlands. A Black Man's Soul exposed a side of Turner's music not as popular with his audiences of the time. While Ike & Tina Turner's repertoire up to that point relied heavily on vocal harmonies and popular soul influences, these tracks reflected a more traditional and simple funk popularized by acts such as Charles Wright & the Watts 103rd Street Rhythm Band, Baby Huey, The Bar-Kays and Brother Jack McDuff among others. One single was released, "Thinking Black" / "Black Angel" (ST-100), distributed by Sterling Award Records in association with Pompeii Records. == Awards and nominations == A Black Man's Soul was nominated for Best R&B; Instrumental Performance at the 12th Annual Grammy Awards. == Reissues == A Black Man's Soul was released as Funky Mule (1975) by DJM Records in the UK and as Ike Turner & His Kings of Rhythm by Bellaphon Records in Germany. In 2003, the album was reissued on CD with four bonus tracks, including three with vocals from Tina Turner. It was digitally remastered and included in the 3-CD compilation The Complete Pompeii Recordings 1968-1969 released from Goldenlane Records in 2016. ==Sampling== *Los Angeles hip-hop group Jurassic 5 sampled "Getting Nasty" in the track "Concrete Schoolyard" on their self-titled EP. == Track listing == All tracks composed by Ike Turner; except where indicated. == Personnel == *Ike Turner - guitar, piano ;The Kings of Rhythm *Jesse Knight - guitar *Mack Johnson - drums *Tommy "Teasky" Tribble - percussion *Fred Sample, Billy Preston - piano *Washee - saxophone *Jesse Heron - trombone ;Technical *Loring Eutemey - cover design == References == ==External links== * Ike Turner & The Kings Of Rhythm – A Black Man's Soul * A Black Man's Soul: The Ike Turner Diaries CD Category:1969 albums Category:Ike Turner albums Category:Instrumental albums Category:Albums produced by Ike Turner Category:Albums produced by Tina Turner Category:Funk albums by American artists Category:London Records albums
7068424	A Black Mass	A Black Mass is a play written by Amiri Baraka and performed at Proctor's Theatre in Newark, New Jersey in 1966. Baraka also recorded a version of the play with Sun Ra's Myth-Science Orchestra in 1968.Discogs The play is based on the religious doctrine of Yakub as taught by the Nation of Islam, and it describes the origin of white people according to this doctrine. A Black Mass, written at the beginning of Baraka's involvement in black nationalism and the Black Arts Movement, was a turning point in the artist's career. Conceived as a form of "action literature", the play aimed to raise the political consciousness of Black Americans. Baraka had learned of the Yakub myth from Malcolm X, whose assassination in 1965 likely provided further inspiration for the work.Collins & Crawford 2006, p. 144. This play is a visceral experience through the use of music and lighting, beginning in a "Jet blackness" accompanied with the "Music of eternal concentration and wisdom" composed by Sun Ra, which represent a prelapsarian state of non-threatening darkness."This 'black endless space' is not threatening but perceived by the black magicians as 'beautiful reality'." Elam 2001, p. 53. Baraka inverts the idea that white symbolizes goodness and black symbolizes wickedness, so that the images of beauty and life are associated with blackness. As Jacoub, the protagonist of the play, creates the "White Beast" that will become the ancestor to the white race, this peaceful blackness is soon contrasted with scenes of pandemonium, in which the room is filled with unsettling melodies and the sounds of banging and screeching (provided in the original production by Sun Ra's Myth Science Arkestra).Collins & Crawford 2006, p. 144. To add to the audience's unease, the actors are not confined to the stage: the "Beast" leaps among the spectators, screaming "White! White! White!" and "Me! Me! Me!". The play ends on a call to arms against this newly created affront against nature: The final statement, which means "May God have mercy," is repeated continuously until the lights go dark. ==References== ==External links== * Recording of A Black Mass, YouTube Category:1966 plays Category:Plays by Amiri Baraka Category:Islam in fiction
54266173	A Black Mile to the Surface	A Black Mile to the Surface is the fifth studio album by American indie rock band Manchester Orchestra. It was released on July 21, 2017, through Loma Vista Recordings and Favorite Gentlemen. Recording for the album took place from the summer of 2016 onwards with producer Catherine Marks. The lead single, "The Gold", was released on June 9, 2017, alongside a music video directed by Mike Dempsey and Johnny Chew. Two more singles, "The Alien" and "The Moth", were released later in the summer. Inspired by their work on the soundtrack for the 2016 film Swiss Army Man, band members Andy Hull and Robert McDowell set out to create an album that was a reset from the band's previous studio albums Cope and Hope (both 2014). A Black Mile to the Surface is an alternative rock and Americana record, interweaving a concept album set in a South Dakota mining town with reflections on Hull's young daughter. The album received generally positive reviews from music critics, who praised Hull's storytelling and the album's cinematic stylings. Commercially, it performed well, debuting at number 33 on the US Billboard 200. ==Background and production== In 2014, American indie rock band Manchester Orchestra released two companion albums, Cope and Hope. Following the release of the two albums, keyboard player Chris Freeman departed the band, leaving vocalist Andy Hull and guitarist Robert McDowell the only original members. In 2016, Hull and McDowell collaborated on the soundtrack for the film Swiss Army Man. The experience of crafting an a cappella soundtrack inspired Manchester Orchestra's approach to their next album, with McDowell saying that it "flipped the reset switch" and inspired Manchester Orchestra to "make every little second interesting". The first three songs to be written for the album were "The Alien", "The Sunshine", and "The Grocery". Hull says, "[o]nce those were written and connected like that, we started to be like, 'Oh you know it'd be cool to do that for the whole thing and actually commit to it'". Many of the songs were reworked over periods of several months, with Hull estimating that "The Moth" took about four and a half months to reach its final form. Hull said that "The Maze" and "The Mistake" both took the longest to perfect, and that producer John Congleton came up with "one more push" that perfected those two tracks. Manchester Orchestra recorded A Black Mile to the Surface with "a small battery of well-known indie rock producers", among them Catherine Marks, John Congleton, and Jonathan Wilson, as well as longtime collaborator Dan Hannon. The recording process began at Echo Mountain Recording in Asheville, North Carolina in the summer of 2016. Marks and Manchester Orchestra had begun collaborating over the phone several months prior, and after a week of pre-production, Marks described the two-week studio recording process as a "sonic discovery", during which she and the band experimented with ideas for how each song should sound. Manchester Orchestra traveled to London with Marks for mixing, and Los Angeles for additional production with Congleton, before finishing production at their headquarters in Alpharetta, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta. ==Composition and themes== A Black Mile to the Surface has been classified as indie rock, alternative rock, and Americana, with comparisons to Fleet Foxes, Band of Horses, and Mumford & Sons. It began life as a concept album set in the mining town of Lead, South Dakota, the home of the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF). As the album developed, the South Dakota narrative began to interweave with Hull's complicated emotions about the birth of his daughter, and his associated feelings of life and death. The opening track, "The Maze", was written a month after the birth of Hull's daughter. While the first four tracks set "a light and dark theme", the narrative part of the record begins on "The Alien", which follows a boy from his childhood abuse into his adult life. Sonically, Hull and the rest of the band sought to divert from the "heavy, crunchy guitars" that marked other Manchester Orchestra releases. Hull was influenced by the "minimalist aspect" of Alabama Shakes' 2015 record Sound & Color, as well as the bands Wilco and Radiohead. He challenged his bandmates to "[t]ry and do the opposite" of "whatever you're instinctively going to want to play". Marks' vision for the album involved wanting every song to sound like a different room, "Like you could understand where you were in the room and identify where each particular sound was coming from." This process involved physically recording in different rooms of the studios to utilize their different reverberations. The penultimate track, "The Parts", for instance, was recorded in a studio's bathtub, due in part to a hangover from which Hull was suffering. Hull has said that the central theme of A Black Mile to the Surface is "family, and the circle of life, the significance and insignificance of yourself". The repeated motif of There's nothing I've got when I die that I keep, Hull explained, means: "When this life ends, all you can do is hopefully affect and influence what happens after you." The title of the album derives from a line in "The Gold", selected by a friend of the band as he read through the lyrics. ==Release and promotion== thumb|Manchester Orchestra performing in support of A Black Mile to the Surface in 2017. Manchester Orchestra announced the name, track list, and cover art for A Black Mile to the Surface on June 9, 2017. The announcement was accompanied by the album's lead single, "The Gold", and a music video for the song, directed by Mike Dempsey and Johnny Chew. The second single, "The Alien", was released 13 days later on NPR, with a video directed by Dempsey and the Daniels. The final pre-album single, "The Moth", was released on July 10, 2017. A Black Mile to the Surface was released on July 21, 2017, through Loma Vista Recordings and the band's own independent label Favorite Gentlemen. On June 12, 2017, only a few days after the album's announcement, Manchester Orchestra announced a fall 2017 headlining tour. In July, they added support from Tigers Jaw and Foxing to the bill. This was followed by a coheadlining tour with the Front Bottoms in November and December 2018, and a winter 2019 tour with Oso Oso and Foxing to celebrate Manchester Orchestra's 10th anniversary of Mean Everything to Nothing. On February 12, 2021, the band performed A Black Mile To The Surface: The Global Concert Film, a YouTube livestream of the album in its entirety recorded from Echo Mountain Recording studios. Hull described the concert film as "the perfect way to close the Black Mile chapter". ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== A Black Mile to the Surface was met with generally positive reviews from music critics. Review aggregator Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, gave the album an average score of 79, while aggregator AnyDecentMusic? similarly bestowed an average of 7.6 out of 10. In a positive review for Alternative Press, Brian Shultz wrote that Manchester Orchestra "forge a newly lush, cinematic sound, unraveling detailed tales of characters with abstractly personal references", and highlighted the album's musicality: "Layers upon layers, from acoustic guitars to programmed beats, create a gorgeous and restrained, immersive landscape, culminating in beautifully serene moments like 'The Alien' and 'The Sunshine'." Adam Feibel of Exclaim! praised the album's "sonic story arc — a story about love, marriage, fatherhood and life's constant way onward — complete with an introduction, rising action, climax and falling action that finally wind down to a conclusive, satisfying end". PopMatters writer Chris Ingalls remarked that the album's sound "doesn't derive from the airtight punk influences of decades past; rather, there's an anthemic, widescreen feel to nearly every song [...] inviting comparisons to altruistic, mid-period U2, or even Coldplay". Other critics were less enthusiastic. Randall Colburn of The A.V. Club found that despite the band's stated intent to "strip back" their sound, "they seem to have gone in the opposite direction—with all the layering, samples, and shout-alongs, A Black Mile to the Surface is bombastic to the point of exhaustion". Carl Purvis was also critical of the album in his review for No Ripcord, writing that, "For a band where constructing songs into rocket-fueled crescendos is their biggest strength, too often does A Black Mile to the Surface fail to take advantage of any momentum it builds, often taking the wrong fork on an ascent to a splendid finale." Ian Cohen of Pitchfork, meanwhile, was critical of the album's storytelling elements, saying that the "more overtly personal material sits awkwardly among the familial drama that served as the original concept". ===Commercial performance=== A Black Mile to the Surface debuted at number 33 on the US Billboard 200 chart. The album also appeared on the US Top Alternative Albums and Top Rock Albums charts, peaking at numbers six and seven, respectively. In the United Kingdom, A Black Mile to the Surface peaked at number 93 on the UK Official Albums Chart and number 59 on the Scottish Albums Chart. Elsewhere, the album appeared on the Swiss Hitparade Albums Top 100 chart at number 73. == Track listing == ==Personnel== Manchester Orchestra *Andy Hull – lead vocals, guitar, producer *Robert McDowell – guitar, keyboards, backing vocals, engineer, producer *Andy Prince – bass guitar *Tim Very – drums Additional musicians *Nate Ruess – additional vocals *Christian Zucconi – additional vocals Technical *Paul Blakemore – mastering *John Congleton – additional production *The Daniels – package design, photography *Mike Dempsey – package design, photography *Jim Georgeson – assistant engineer *Dan Hannon – additional production *Brian Manley – layout, package design *Catherine Marks – engineer, producer, mixing *Clay Miller – assistant engineer *India Watne – artists and repertoire *Ryan Whalley – artists and repertoire *Jonathan Wilson – additional production Credits taken from A Black Mile to the Surface liner notes. ==Charts== Weekly chart performance for A Black Mile to the Surface Chart (2017) Peak position ==References== Category:2017 albums Category:Manchester Orchestra albums Category:Loma Vista Recordings albums Category:Albums produced by Catherine Marks Category:Concept albums
4266729	A Black Moon Broods Over Lemuria	A Black Moon Broods Over Lemuria, is Bal-Sagoth's 1995 debut album after their 1993 demo. The album was recorded in a two-week period in June 1994, but due to label problems the album was released almost a year later. The name Lemuria comes from a hypothetical land mass in the Indian Ocean. The keyboard intro on this album was written and performed by Keith Appleton, the proprietor of Academy Music Studio, the studio where the album was recorded.https://web.archive.org/web/20080607231205/http://www.bal- sagoth.freeserve.co.uk/discography.html On 13 May 2016 the album was re- released by Cacophonous Records as a special edition CD featuring remastered audio, expanded lyric booklet, new sleeve notes and exclusive new artwork.

43359308	A Black Veil for Lisa	A Black Veil for Lisa (, lit. "Death has no sex") is a 1968 thriller film directed by Massimo Dallamano. == Plot == Lisa Buloff wears a black dress and veil at a funeral for an unspecified deceased loved one. Weeks beforehand, Willie Zoll is drinking at a bar, ready to provide Inspector Franz Buloff, leading investigator in the Hamburg narcotics department for Interpol, information on major drug world target Harry Scheurermann. When he turns a corner into an alley, a figured stabs him to death, leaving the switchblade used and his dime-store disguise behind at the scene. Buloff is extremely disgruntled, as he was going to provide their best lead. Two other contract killings silenced witnesses and whistleblowers beforehand, somehow around the time they were to give information to the police. His boss, Ostermeyer, is most provoked and insists Buloff find another lead. Buloff returns home to his wife Lisa. She had previous affiliations with Scheurermann, but Buloff believed she wasn't involved in his enterprises and married her. However, Buloff has been controlling and domineering of her, tracking her activities out of paranoia. He demands to know why she didn't answer the phone, and when he doesn't believe her answer that she was sleeping, she bitterly retorts she was waiting for him to suspect something. When he storms off to pour himself a drink, Buloff later sees Lisa changed into a nightdress, and they make love. Buloff tries to call his wife the next day to check on her again, but she leaves the phone ringing when she heads out the door. He then interrogates a young woman, Marianne Loma, who he briefly hallucinates as Lisa. Under threat of false detainment, the woman reveals her friend Ursula Stein had her pick up a score for Ursula's boyfriend, Kurt Mueller, who can't leave since the drug ring is after him. Marianne is provided protective custody for her cooperation. Lisa then arrives at the station wanting money from Buloff, which he obliges; he tries to ask about her activities later, but she politely refuses the question and says he's too jealous and works too much. The police try to get to Mueller at Ursula's place, but Scheurermann's thugs are there first, beating Ursula even though she doesn't talk, then kidnapping her. Buloff goes to his informant at the news stand, nicknamed "The Rabbit", and all he can provide is tulips are involved in the ring. When asked about Mueller, he avoids giving information out of fear. The hitman, Max Lindt, meets his employer Olaf, a middle man to Scheurermann. Lindt, while tossing his lucky dollar with a bullet hole he keeps everywhere he goes, takes his pay and plans to by a plane ticket out of the country. Olaf demands he take one more hired murder, leaving Lindt in a tight spot despite Lindt wanting to flee while he's still at large, but Lindt only agrees when Olaf threatens Scheurermann's goons will kill him. Kurt Mueller is his assigned target. When Buloff returns home, he sees a note Lisa left him under a bouquet of tulips. She says she's out having a supper with a school friend, but Buloff finds she left the restaurant early when he heads there. Mueller calls for his fix from Fritz, a bar owner involved with the mob, but Mueller is lured to a post office box by Fritz, with the goons in earshot to report to Lindt. Mueller gets to the letter box, where Lindt is waiting and stabs him to death, leaving his flashlight and disguise behind and breaking Mueller's watch when set to the wrong time. Buloff interrogates Lisa on her whereabouts, which makes her angry as she's not believed and Buloff doesn't stop wanting to possess her and keep her movements in his orbit. When Buloff criticizes her for her involvement with the drug ring, ironically because of one of the victims Lindt killed, Rhinehardt, Lisa merely counters with how her home life isn't better. When she proclaims in spite she'll find an affair to have with another man, Buloff hits her and she runs off. Mueller is found by the police, and the package, in a letter box under "Wiener", was really filled with baking soda, but Buloff catches a break as he finds Lindt accidentally left his lucky dollar behind. Lindt flips out when he realizes he's lost it and tears apart wherever he worries it might be. Buloff finally fingers Lindt when he sees him in lobby footage at headquarters, remembering his habit of tossing it. Buloff has his men check up on a red Porsche he knows Lisa was in. He finds Lindt's friend, Eric Scheurer, at his job at the fun fair, accosting him for info he doesn't give. When Scheurer calls Lindt's hotel from a payphone, Buloff watches and intercepts the call to get Lindt's location. Buloff gets Lindt's room from the hotel staff, arresting him while he packs. When Lindt is given the dollar back, he tries to drop it on the floor for an escape, but Buloff hits him to put it out of his mind. Lindt surrenders and is amazed Buloff is the detective on his case since he's in Narcotics. On the drive to headquarters, Buloff sees Lisa get into a red Porsche, trying to follow her, but losing her. Uncuffing Lindt, Buloff blackmails him into a plan for Lindt to kill Lisa, in exchange for his freedom. Lisa's friend she mentioned, Irini von Klaus, does have such a car, so when Buloff finds out, he tries to stop Lindt. He finds Lisa at home, still alive, and Buloff apologizes to her. She scolds him for harassing her over how she lives her life and not believing her, and he tries to show he loves her by vehemently kissing her. Buloff gets a call from The Rabbit, who has more info on the tulips, but he's later killed by a car slamming into him, revealing the enforcers got him first. Buloff has Lisa stay at home for the day, as Lindt still believes the job is on and she can't be seen by him. Lindt instead shows up at the house, pretending to be an insurance salesman. Lisa doesn't by it, but they're both attracted to each other and have sex, shortly after Lisa lies to Buloff over the phone no one's at the house. Buloff is again relieved Lisa is still alive when he returns home, until he reconvenes with max at an abandoned factory. Lindt shamelessly reveals their tryst, before Buloff throws him into his own car hood and says the job is still on. Lindt is torn, but in the end, he doesn't care for killing Lisa and progresses into a full affair with her, where he tells her his real name but not his activities. Buloff tracks them both to the hotel they meet at, then Lisa to a tulip stand. She calls Scheurermann from a payphone, revealing she's the leak who's been ratting the victims out to his ring. As Lisa is also a lover of Scheurermann and gets fixes from him, his henchmen corner Lindt on Olaf's boat and beat him into not seeing her any longer. Lindt calls Buloff for a meeting in the woods to get this lucky dollar back. Buloff concedes to the consequences of his actions and Lisa's, writing a full report on what he knows about Scheurermann and Lindt, along with his actions, but leaving Lisa out of the details to protect her. Lindt is prepared to meet Buloff, leaving Lisa behind and taking a switchblade with him. When at the rendezvous, Buloff places Lindt under formal arrest, seeing through Lindt's lie about him killing Lisa. Lindt boasts Buloff will pay to, which he accepts. Lindt pulls his knife and slits Buloff's throat before stabbing him, Buloff's last words being "you're done for anyway". While Lisa's at the hotel phoning Scheurermann for another meeting, the police are dispatched to arrest Max. Max runs into the woods and fires Buloff's service weapon, but he's shot dead in retaliation. Lisa meets Scheurermann, who rejects her and reveals he knows about Lindt's affair with her; he shocks her from revealing Buloff hired Lindt to off her. The episode ends with Lisa at the funeral, revealed to be for her late husband. Ostermeyer says to Lisa that Buloff "was an outstanding man [...] to the end"; it's never revealed if he's confirmed her involvement, but he heavily implies wanting her silence about Buloff's corruption. == Cast == ==Production== A Black Veil for Lisa was shot in 1968 in Hamburg under the title Vicolo cieco. Curti described the style of the film as "remarkably different" from the Italian thrillers of the period, and closer to Anglo-Saxon and German models of the style. ==Release== A Black Veil for Lisa was released in Italy in September 1968. was shown in Germany as Das Geheimnis der jungen Witwe (translation: Mystery of the Young Widow). in this country, it was promoted as being part of the Edgar Wallace series. It was also released as Showdown. ==Reception== From contemporary reviews, "Whit." of Variety described the film as an "okay programmer" and that "Massimo Dallamano's direction [...] is as sturdy as script, on which he also collabed, will permit, and color camera work by Angelo Lotti is particularly effective." ==References== ===Sources=== * * ==External links== * Category:1968 films Category:Giallo films Category:1960s Italian-language films Category:Films directed by Massimo Dallamano Category:Films set in West Germany Category:Films scored by Gianfranco Reverberi Category:Films scored by Giovanni Fusco Category:1960s Italian films

63781388	A Blade So Black	A Blade So Black is a young adult fantasy novel written by L.L. McKinney and volume 1 of The Nightmare-Verse series.

A Blade So Black was released on September 25, 2018 by Imprint/Macmillan. == Plot == "When Atlanta teenager Alice Kingston’s father dies of heart failure—while at their favorite event, Dragon Con—she immediately is attacked by a “Nightmare” monster and then saved by Addison Hatta, a guardian of the portal between Atlanta and Wonderland." == Themes == The book deals with themes of nightmares and fears. It incorporates elements of generational trauma specific to the treatment of African Americans in the American south. A Blade So Black has been described as Afrofuturist by scholars. == Critical reception == School Library Journal described the book as "a must-purchase where refreshing urban fantasies and retellings are in demand. Enishia Davenport wrote in a starred review for Booklist, "McKinney breathes new life and fierce empowerment into Carroll’s classic. Her Wonderland is menacing, lush, and unique and populated by nuanced characters that are fleshed out and refreshingly authentic." Kate Quealy-Gainer described it in a review for The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books: "With a modern flair, a rich backstory, and just enough emotional heft, this particular looking glass will have readers eagerly falling through it." In a less positive review, Publishers Weekly stated: "The mechanics of Wonderland, its features, and its creatures sometimes feel hastily sketched, and secondary characters lack depth, but McKinney’s imagination knows few bounds, and Alice’s devotion to the others is contagious." == Adaptations == In December 2018 it was announced that Lionsgate optioned television rights to the book. == References == == External links == *A Blade So Black on Macmillan Publishers Category:2018 American novels Category:African-American novels Category:African-American young adult novels Category:Novels set in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:American fantasy novels Category:2018 debut novels Category:Afrofuturist novels
13538989	A Blade in the Dark	A Blade in the Dark () is a 1983 Italian giallo film directed by Lamberto Bava. Originally planned for television, the film was made as a nearly two hour piece split into four parts each of which would end with a murder scene. After the film was found to be too gruesome for Italian television censors, it was re-edited into a feature film. == Plot == The film begins with three boys entering an old house, two pushing the third boy inside, where he's to take a dare. The pair gang up on him by throwing a tennis ball into the basement, saying he's a "girl" if he doesn't retrieve it and chanting he's a "female" when he hesitates. The boy slowly shuffles down in fear, and after some suspense, a scream is heard when he's out of sight. The ball is thrown back, stained with what looks like blood, causing the two other boys to flee out of their own terror. This is later revealed to be a film scene within the film itself. Musician Bruno is hired to compose soundtrack for an upcoming horror film, renting the villa where the movie is set for a few weeks to help his inspiration. Property owner Tony Rendina, who's off to his father's rig in Kuwait, is delighted that Bruno accepts his request for some of his music, which Bruno promises to arrange for recording on a cassette. Giovanni lives in the basement as the groundskeeper, and Bruno's girlfriend Giulia is an actress off to another city for a stage play. Director Sandra is trying to capture the fear of the dark in the film, reels of scenes revealing it's inspired by the circumstances of the opening scene. She refuses anyone seeing the ending to not spoil the production for its complete artistic effect. Bruno is told before Tony owned the property, a woman named Linda leased out the villa, but she's since disappeared after moving out and never been heard from again. An unseen figure steals an extendable box cutter from Bruno's studio, finding a naked woman in a magazine image to leave cuts in for Bruno to find. Bruno meets Katia, one of the neighbors, who comes in unannounced and is scared by an arachnid in a cabinet. She doesn't tell him why she's there, but she flirts with him before leaving. Bruno finds Katia left her diary, which says she found out Linda's "secret". Katia is attacked outside by the figure, chased into the basement, where she hides behind unfinished drywall. The attacker finds her and jams the box cutter through the mesh, eventually slashing Katia's stomach and throat, causing her bleed to death. When Bruno goes outside when he hears the killer drag Katia's body, the killer pulls out the blade ready to slash him too. Not noticing Katia right at his feet, Bruno heads back inside, where he finds blood on his pants and receives a silent phone call. Bruno eventually goes over his music tapes, where he hears a woman's voice whispering "no one must know" the secret about Linda. The tapes are later destroyed, the diary pages thrown into the active fireplace. Giulia comes to surprise Bruno with a visit, supposedly in between rehearsals. When Bruno talks about his suspicions of Katia's murder, Giulia doesn't believe him and worries Bruno is cheating on her, causing their relationship to tense. When he later calls the theater company, the director revealed she couldn't keep attendance and was fired. Katia's roommate Angela arrives, saying the two women were both models and Linda let then go swimming in her pool, which Bruno graciously welcomes as well. She can't answer many questions about Linda, who apparently returns, as a figure in heels, a sweater and skirt, and red nail polish watches Angela in the changing room. When she goes into the pool, Angela finds the utility blade sunk to the floor. When she goes back inside to wash her hair, Linda stabs her hand into the bathroom vanity counter, covering her head in plastic and beating her head on the counter edge. She then rips Angela's hand away and slashes her throat over the bathtub before cleaning the scene. When Bruno sees the kitchen knife out of place and a hole in the vanity, he connects the dots, but he's still not believed. He goes into Linda's stored belongings in the basement with Sandra, where suitcases with her things included one filled with tennis balls. Sandra reveals Linda is the movie's primary inspiration. Giulia returns with a knife, as she's now scared because of the murders. Sandra places a call to Linda, saying how sorry she is and that she embellished the ending specifically, but Linda quietly cries and hangs up. Linda is shown back at the villa from the view outside her window. She retaliates by finding the final scene at the studio and shredding it with scissors. When Giovanni discovers Katia and Angela dead inside a tank, Linda bludgeons him to death with his own wrench. When Sandra arrives to reconcile with Linda, carrying a knife for self-defense, Giovanni jumps out to grab her before he dies. Linda surprises Sandra by garroting her with film reel, laughing maniacally while dragging her corpse around. Giulia arrives to find Sandra's body buried under film. Linda traps Giulia in the house by closing the garage door, taunting her with threats, messing with the lights, and dropping a ton of tennis balls from the ceiling. Giulia hides in a cabinet when she sees Linda, who finds her and wedges the knife in the closed door. When Bruno arrives, Giulia takes her chance to run, but Linda pierces her through her heart with the kitchen knife. With Bruno happening upon the scene, Linda charges him, only for Bruno to knock her out with a brick. Bruno is then surprised when only a wig is where Linda was left. The killer jumps out, revealing himself as Tony all along. When Tony tries to stab him, Bruno rams the knife in Tony, who slowly dies while muttering "I'm not a female child" a few times. Bruno talks with a crew member, revealing Tony was too insecure and childlike inside to stave off Linda, his alter-ego, so he murdered other women out of rage and to prove he was a man. The final reel put back together reveals the boy in the basement, a young Tony, leaving with a skirt and a wig with pigtails. == Cast == * Andrea Occhipinti as Bruno * Michele Soavi as Tony Rendina/Linda * Lara Lamberti as Giulia Rubini (as Lara Naszinski) * Fabiola Toledo as Angela * Anny Papa as Sandra * Stanko Molnar as Giovanni * Valeria Cavalli as Katia * Giovanni Frezza as young boy in film clip * Lamberto Bava (cameo in editing room) ==Production== Lamberto Bava was offered to direct A Blade in the Dark while he was assisting Dario Argento on Tenebrae (1982). The film was written by the husband and wife writing team of Dardano Sacchetti and Elisa Briganti. Bava and Sacchetti recalled that their collaboration was difficult, with the two being more friendly during the production of A Bay of Blood (1971), but their approach to this film was at odds with each other. The film was initially commissioned to be made for Italian television by producer Mino Loy and have been aired in four 30 minute segments. Bava explained that his initial goal was to have a shocking murder at the end of each segment. Producer Luciano Martino offered Bava his villa as a location for filming. ==Release== When the film was presented to the television censors, it was found to be too gory to be aired. Rather than edit the film, the producers instructed Bava to cut the film into a theatrical feature. This led to the 16mm print being blown up to 35mm for theatrical distribution. The film was released in Italy on August 6, 1983. Troy Howarth in his book on giallo films described the English dubbing of the film as "some of the worst to be inflicted upon any giallo". The film was released three times on DVD in the United States. It was first released by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 2001. The company subsequently re-released it in 2003 on a double feature DVD with Lamberto Bava's Macabre. Both these versions are out of print. The third DVD release came from Blue Underground in 2007. On Blu-ray, the film was released for the first time by 88 Films on August 23, 2015. == Critical reception == AllMovie gave the film a mixed review, writing, "Lamberto Bava eschews complex mystery in favor of elaborate stalk-and-slash sequences, with only partial success". == References == ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * * * == External links == * Category:Giallo films Category:1983 films Category:Films directed by Lamberto Bava Category:1983 horror films Category:Italian serial killer films Category:1980s Italian-language films Category:Films about composers Category:Films set in country houses Category:Italian horror films Category:Films scored by Guido & Maurizio De Angelis Category:Films produced by Luciano Martino Category:1980s Italian films Category:Italian slasher films

Tzoumerkas' second feature film after Hora Proelefsis, A Blast had its world premiere at the International Competition section of the Locarno International Film Festival 2014. Praised by the international press for its visceral filming and acting, its bold content and form, the film went on to screen in over 70 festivals and to be theatrically released in many countries around the world. ==Cast== * Angeliki Papoulia as Maria * Vassilis Doganis as Yannis * Maria Filini as Gogo * Themis Bazaka as the mother * Yorgos Biniaris as the father * Makis Papadimitriou as Costas * Haris Attonis as the clerk * Eleni Karagiorgi as Niki * Christoph Berlet as Joy ==Plot== A woman's violent journey to a renewed and disillusioned sense of self passes through a series of catastrophes. Following her mother's suicide after entrapping her whole family in a huge debt, Maria, a mother of three, decides to burn the forest surrounding her father's village to get money from a construction company, abandon her loving but constantly cheating and absent husband and their three children, coming to unreconcilable clashes with her always passive father, her half-crazy sister and her fascist brother-in-law. Bits of her rogue present are constantly interwoven with the days of her brighter, full of potential and sexually flourishing love past, creating a dazzling portrait of a woman and a country breaking into pieces. ==Production== A Blast was first presented as an in development project by Homemade Films and producer Maria Drandaki at the Cinelink of the Sarajevo Film Festival 2012 where it was awarded with the Eurimages Co-production Development Award. German producer Titus Kreyenberg and Dutch producers Ellen Havenith and Jeroen Beker became attached and the film was funded by the Greek Film Center, the Dutch Film Fund, FIlm und Medienstiftung NRW and Filmfoerderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein. Pan Entertainment, Graal SA, Marni Films, Mamoko Entertainment, Prosenghisi LTD, and Movimento Film served as co- producers. As Syllas Tzoumerkas stated in an interview with Cineuropa, the film's production was delayed and put in jeopardy by prime-minister Antonis Samaras' abrupt shutting down of ERT, the Greek state television, however the film started production in September 2013. Filming took place in Athens, Hamburg and the under construction tunnels of the Aegean Highway connecting Larisa to Thessaloniki. ==Release== The film premiered at the 2014 Locarno International Film Festival. Due to the film's explicit sex scenes, Locarno Film Festival put on its catalogue, tickets and promotional publications the note that "this film may hurt the sensitivities of some viewers". After its world premiere, the film became a festival-circuit regular, screening in several international film festivals such as BFI London Film Festival, Sarajevo Film Festival, Rotterdam Film Festival, Karlovy Vary Film Festival (Variety's 10 European Directors to Watch), Jeonju Film Festival, São Paulo Film Festival (New Directors Competition), Hamburg Filmfest, Hong-Kong Film Festival, etc. It was released in Greece 22 November 2014 by Strada Films, and after that in Holland (12 March 2015), Germany (16 April 2015), Italy (27 August 2015), Poland (12 September 2015), Denmark (19 September 2014), etc. The film's DVD and VOD release is handled in the US by Indiepix FIlms. ==Reception== Screen Daily's chief film critic Mark Adams gave the film a rave review upon its world premiere at the Locarno International Film Festival calling it a "freewheeling and full-on drama, driven forcefully and with a certain fearlessness by a striking lead performance by Angeliki Papoulia as a free-spirited woman who reaches the end of her tether". Indiewire & The Playlist's Jessica Kiang called the film a "punchy, difficult, allegorically urgent Greek tragedy, where a narrative of personal liberation becomes a political allegory of powerful pessimism", reading the main character's journey as "a series of assassinations". The Hollywood Reporter's Jonathan Holland describes the film as "a black, bleak, urgently contemporary film, Syllas Tzoumerkas' charged personal diatribe against an economic system seemingly designed first to make people, and then to break them". In October 2015, Guy Lodge gave the film a mixed review in Variety, praising the film for its energy and performances, but criticising it over thematic and construction elements, calling it "unruly, exhausting but appropriately incendiary". The film was met with mostly positive to great reviews in the countries it was released, praised for its bold directing and editing style and Angeliki Papoulia's lead performance. Der Spiegel's Oliver Kaever called Angeliki Papoulia "one of the most fearless European actress" for her turn as Maria and Polityka in Poland called it "a uniquely intelligent, unprecedented portrait that reveals the moods, secrets and deep divisions that run in the Greek society in the times of crisis". Süddeutsche Zeitung's F.Goettler noted that "with its passionate, impetuous and revolting hero A Blast is the Greek crisis" and in Dutch Der Filmkrant Joost Booren wrote that "Syllas Tzoumerkas takes in his energetic second film emphatic distance from the 'Greek Weird Wave'. "A Blast" is an angry film that speaks its heart". On the contrary, upon its release in its home country Greece, the film was met with mixed reviews, with critics in leading newspapers like To Vima and magazines like Athinorama reacting negatively to its pessimistic view of the country, its complicated structure and overt sexuality. Favourable reviews of the film were written in Lifo and Cinema magazines and Kathimerini newspaper. ==Accolades== A Blast and Syllas Tzoumerkas were nominated for the Golden Leopard at the International Competition of the Locarno Film Festival 2014, the Heart of Sarajevo at the Sarajevo International Film Festival 2014, the New Directors Competition Award of the São Paulo International Film Festival, the New Directors Competition of the Seattle International Film Festival, among others. The film was selected by the A.F.I. (American Film Institute) for its annual European Film Showcase and was awarded with the Jury Prize and the FIPRESCI Jury prize in Otranto and Prishtina film festivals respectively. For her performance as Gogo, Maria Filini was awarded with the Best Debut Actress Award at the Athens Film Festival 2015. == References == ==External links== * Official site * Syllas Tzoumerkas * Homemade Films Category:2014 films Category:2010s Greek-language films Category:Greek drama films Category:Films shot in Athens Category:2010s Greek films
2054290	A Blaze in the Northern Sky	A Blaze in the Northern Sky is the second studio album by Norwegian black metal band Darkthrone. It was recorded at Creative Studios in August 1991Darkthrone – A Blaze in the Northern Sky CD cover and released on 26 February 1992 by Peaceville Records. It contained the band's first black metal recordings and is considered a classic within the genre. It was the first album of what fans dub the "Unholy Trinity", the other albums being Under a Funeral Moon and Transilvanian Hunger.Eduardo Rivadavia: Under a Funeral Moon - Darkthrone.James Montague: Darkthrone - The Cult Is Alive. It was the last album to feature bassist Dag Nilsen. In 2020, the album was put on the National Library of Norway's permanent exhibition due to its significance to Norwegian culture and as a starting point for Norwegian Black Metal. == Background == Darkthrone's first album, 1991's Soulside Journey, was a Swedish-styled death metal release. After recording Soulside Journey, the band began writing songs with more black metal traits. This yielded the instrumental demo Goatlord. After recording Goatlord, three of the band members—Fenriz, Nocturno Culto and Zephyrous—decided that they wanted to focus on making black metal music. Bassist Nilsen disliked this shift in direction, and quit the band. However, he agreed to record his bass parts for the album as a session member. A Blaze in the Northern Sky was recorded during August 1991 at Creative Studios in Kolbotn; the same studio where Mayhem recorded their influential Deathcrush EP. In an interview, Fenriz said that the album was somewhat "rushed" and that many of the songs have "death metal guitar riffs" played in a "black metal style". Due to Darkthrone's sudden change from death metal to black metal, Peaceville was unwilling to release the album as it was. The shocked record label had expected that the band would continue recording death metal in the vein of Soulside Journey. Peaceville agreed to release the album only if they were able to remix it, stating that the sound was "too weak". The band then threatened to release it through Deathlike Silence Productions, the record label owned by Øystein "Euronymous" Aarseth of Mayhem (to whom the album is dedicated). However, Peaceville eventually agreed to release the album as it was recorded. == Release == The album was released by Peaceville on 26 February 1992. The first CD pressing was limited to 2,000 copies and had a white disc. The front cover featured Ivar Enger (Zephyrous), the band's rhythm guitarist. It was remastered and reissued by Peaceville in 2003, as well as being repackaged in a cardboard digipak. The second chapter of a four-part video interview (spanning the first four albums) with Fenriz and Nocturno was also included. A Blaze was reissued again by Peaceville in December 2009 as a double gatefold LP on 180 gram vinyl, limited to 2,000 copies. === Critical reception === In his retrospective review of the album, Eduardo Rivadavia from AllMusic gave A Blaze 5 out of 5 stars, calling it "a classic whose almost indefensibly lo-fi standards would reinvigorate an entire strain of black metal". Valefor from Metal Reviews wrote that it "would come to epitomize True Black Metal [...] raw production, simple riffs, no color on their album covers... just pure frozen evil."Valefor: Darkthrone - A Blaze in the Northern Sky. Retrieved 4 October 2012. Channing Freeman of Sputnikmusic called the album "triumphant", with a balanced blend of "frozen production and guttural screams" and "a sense of community". In 2009, IGN included A Blaze in the Northern Sky in their "10 Great Black Metal Albums" list, while a 2007 article in Decibel magazine called it "the first truly blackened death metal album". Kerrang! called it "a dark watershed for the black metal genre" and the song In the Shadow of the Horns as "seven minutes of defiant lo-fi production, frostbitten purpose and blunt-force simplicity". == Track listing == == Personnel == === Darkthrone === * Nocturno Culto – lead guitar, vocals * Zephyrous – rhythm guitar * Fenriz – drums, backing vocals === Additional musicians === * Dag Nilsen – bass guitar === Production === * Dave Pybus – album cover design == References == Category:Darkthrone albums Category:1992 albums Category:Peaceville Records albums

73850178	A Blazing Grace	A Blazing Grace is an album by the American band Jason & the Scorchers, released in 1995 on Mammoth Records. The initial album title was Men and Women, War and Peace. The band supported the album with a North American tour. The first single, "Take Me Home, Country Roads", was a modest radio hit. ==Production== The album marked a reunion of the band's original lineup; the band, in part, recorded the album as an excuse to play live and tour. Produced by the band, A Blazing Grace was recorded at Castle Studio, in Nashville. All of the band members were struggling with personal issues, and regarded the offer of free studio time as a blessing. "Why Baby Why" is a cover of the George Jones song; "Take Me Home, Country Roads" is a cover of the John Denver song. The band initially intended the cover songs to be b-sides. "Somewhere Within" was Jason Ringenberg's favorite composition. ==Critical reception== Newsday wrote that "Ringenberg's high-lonesome tone has always lent itself to balladeering, and it might be a mark of age and experience that a couple of the album's best songs gear down to make breathing room for heartfelt expression." The Indianapolis Star noted that "the Scorchers haven't lost one iota of supercharged twang." The Washington Post determined that Ringenberg "attacks the [songs] as if he were leading the Ramones at the Grand Ole Opry." Don McLeese, of the Austin American-Statesman, opined: "Though I once considered the Scorchers the great lost American rock band of the '80s, the band has regrouped with a 1995 album that is arguably its best—and is likely to rank with the year's best as well." Guitar Player deemed guitarist Warner Hodges "the Eddie Van Halen of country-punk." The Vancouver Sun concluded that "there's nothing amusing about taking George Jones' sublime 'Why Baby Why' and subjecting it to sub-metal boogieization." ==Track listing== ==References== Category:Jason & the Scorchers albums Category:1995 albums Category:Mammoth Records albums

7218457	A Blind Bargain	A Blind Bargain is a 1922 American silent horror film starring Lon Chaney and Raymond McKee, released through Goldwyn Pictures. The film was directed by Wallace Worsley and is based on Barry Pain's 1897 novel The Octave of Claudius. Lon Chaney played a dual role in the film, as both Dr. Lamb and "the Ape Man", one of Chaney's few "true horror films". The claim that Wallace Beery appeared as an ape-man uncredited has never been proven, but does persist in many sources.Blake, Michael F. (1998). "The Films of Lon Chaney". Vestal Press Inc. Page 127. . Although the film was finished in November 1921, it was only released in December 1922. This delay was due to problems with the censors, as the film's theme dealt with doctors creating artificial life and attempting to play God. The film was cut from six reels to five in the process, and the title cards had to be rewritten four times.Blake, Michael F. (1998). "The Films of Lon Chaney". Vestal Press Inc. Page 127.. The film is now considered lost and remains today one of the most sought after lost films of Lon Chaney's career. A lobby card from the film exists on the internet, as well as a photo of Chaney in the Ape Man makeup. ==Plot== The film is a contemporary 1920s picture (though the book was published in 1897) that takes place in New York City. The story involves a mad scientist who forces a man who is down on his luck to enter into an agreement to become a willing subject of the doctor's weird experiments, knowing full well that the end result will be the loss of his humanity. Robert Sandell (McKee), despondent over his failure as a writer and his mother's declining health, attempts to rob a theatergoer, Dr. Lamb (Lon Chaney), a sinister, fanatical physician living in the suburbs of New York. Lamb takes the boy to his home, learns his story, and agrees to perform an operation on Mrs. Sandell (Virginia True Boardman) on one condition – that Robert shall, at the end of eight days time, deliver himself to the doctor to do with as he will for experimental purposes. Frantic with worry over his dying mother's condition, Robert blindly agrees to the bargain. Mother and son take up their residence in the Lamb home, where Robert is closely watched, not only by the doctor, but also by his wife (Fontaine La Rue) and a grotesque hunchback (also Lon Chaney, in a dual role), whom Robert learns afterwards is the result of one of the doctor's first experiments. Dr. Lamb, anxious to keep his hold over Robert, not only gives him spending money, but also assists him in having his book published through Wytcherly, the head of a publishing company. Robert meets Wytcherly's daughter Angela (Jacqueline Logan) and promptly falls in love. In the meantime, the days are slipping by to the time of the experiment. Robert has been warned by Mrs. Lamb and the hunchback that great danger threatens him. At dawn, they show him as a warning a mysterious underground vault which holds a complete operating room and a tunnel of cages in which are confined strange half-human prisoners – the previously failed experiments of Dr. Lamb's. In agony and fear, Robert pleads with the physician and tries to buy his way out of the bargain, for now that his book has been published, he is now a successful writer. Only one day remains before the time limit is up, but the doctor, realizing his victim is considering escaping, seizes him and straps him to the operating table. Robert is rescued by Mrs. Lamb, the hunchback releases one of the cage doors, and the doctor is himself brutally murdered at the hands of an ape-man who was destroyed mentally by the doctor's experiments. Finally freed from the terms of his "blind bargain", Robert returns to his home to learn that his book has met with success and that Angela awaits him at the altar. == Cast == ==Background and production== Based on Barry Pain's novel, The Octave of Claudius, A Blind Bargain tied together horrific elements for which Lon Chaney became so well known. His characterizations of both Dr. Lamb and the hunchback assistant showcased Chaney's talent for makeup. For the finale, the ape-man that is released upon Dr. Lamb was rumored to have been played by Wallace Beery, in an uncredited cameo performance. ==Release and reception== The film was premiered December 3, 1922, at the Capitol Theater in New York, and met with a standing ovation the opening night of the film. Critical response for the film was good, most praising Lon Chaney's dual performance as the mad doctor and his apish servant as being the highlight of the picture. "It appears to have been the aim of all connected with this production to accent the weird, mysterious and uncanny elements and to make the picture so that it would thrill and fascinate spectators because of its horror and mystery...Lon Chaney's work in this picture is really marvelous and he again demonstrates that he is one of the best, if not the very best, character actor on the screen. As the ape-man, his portrayal and likeness to a huge chimpanzee is wonderful and sends chills up and down your spine. " ---Moving Picture World "Chaney, doubling as both the doctor and his hunchback, gives a creditable performance and allows for some double photography that is by no means unworthy of mention. Always at his best in a grotesque make-up, Chaney predominates in the character of the man-ape, using the ungainly lope of the supposed animal as a means of locomotion throughout the interpretation of the character." ---Variety "A theme that is thoroughly appropriate and suitable for Lon Chaney, providing him with two distinct roles in which he is given plenty of opportunities to live up to his reputation as "a man with a thousand faces"....Those who like his particular type of (grotesque) portrayal will find plenty to satisfy them." ---Film Daily "Mr. Chaney essays the dual role assigned to him with that fine assurance that marks all of his work. His make- up is of course wonderful and one marvels at the contrast between the Doctor with his erect and distinguished carriage and the deformed little man victimized by the surgical experiments." ---Exhibitors Trade Review "As the doctor, Chaney is not so good. Lon as a grotesque mistake of nature is far more thrilling than Lon in a frock coat and a vandyke beard. There are many thrills --- illogical perhaps, but now and then breath taking." ---Photoplay == Preservation and technical specifications == Today, the film is considered lost. The original negative was destroyed in 1931 by MGM several years after the takeover of Goldwyn Studios, and the last surviving print is believed to have perished in the same 1965 fire in Vault #7 that also destroyed the last known prints of London After Midnight and a number of other Lon Chaney films. The footage count in the film was . The film was tinted and toned various colors, including blue tone/flesh tint, blue tint, night amber, straw amber, light lavender, green tint, and one sequence at a party was stencil colored using the Handschiegl Color Process, in multi-coloring bubbles that were made during a party.Original cutting continuity. == Influences == Three years after A Blind Bargain was released, Chaney's co-star, Ray McKee, appeared with Clara Bow in a film titled Free to Love. McKee's character is a criminal who is a hunchback. This character is the direct result of McKee's working with Chaney in A Blind Bargain and shows the Chaney influence on McKee. The character is a strange amalgam of Chaney's character in A Blind Bargain and of his real-life hunchback co-star, John George, who was a Chaney regular in several films. == See also == * List of lost films * List of early color feature films == References == == External links == * * *A Blind Bargain at silentera.com Category:1922 films Category:1920s color films Category:1922 lost films Category:1920s monster movies Category:American silent feature films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films directed by Wallace Worsley Category:Films set in the 1920s Category:Films set in New York City Category:Goldwyn Pictures films Category:Lost horror films Category:Mad scientist films Category:1920s science fiction horror films Category:Lost American films Category:American monster movies Category:Lost science fiction films Category:1920s American films Category:1922 horror films Category:1920s English-language films Category:Silent science fiction horror films Category:English-language science fiction horror films

52209969	A Blonde Dream	A Blonde Dream () is a 1932 German musical comedy film directed by Paul Martin and starring Lilian Harvey, Willy Fritsch and Willi Forst. A separate English- language version Happy Ever After was made as a co-production with Gainsborough Pictures. A French-language version was also released. It was shot at the Babelsberg Studios in Berlin. The film's sets were designed by the art director Erich Kettelhut. ==Plot== Berlin at the height of the Depression at the beginning of the 1930s. The two window cleaners from the company Blitz- Blank, Willy I and Willy II, cycle back and forth through the big city from job to job, from house to house, with a ladder and washing utensils. They get along brilliantly and only clash when both are interested in the same girl. One day the blonde Jou-Jou enters her life. You see them through the window of the American Consulate General. When Jou-Jou is about to be thrown out of the house by the gruff porter, the two stand by her side as knights. Jou-Jou, who earns her living as a projectile in a traveling circus, dreams of a film career in America. A Mr. Merryman, rumored to be a major Hollywood mogul, once promised her a Hollywood film career for a fee of $25. The two Willys decide to help the girl. They take her home first so that she and her shaggy mongrel nicknamed Buffalo can have a roof over their heads. Both window cleaners live poorly but happily far from the city gates in the middle of a meadow - in two miserable but wildly romantic railway carriages that are looked after by an odd guy called 'Scarecrow'. Jou-Jou is assigned a discarded express train carriage as his own accommodation. But soon it is unmistakable that both Willy I and Willy II have their eyes on the blond dream. "Scarecrow" warns Jou-Jou that her presence here threatens to severely test the friendship of the two window cleaners. When the girl reads in the newspaper that Mr. Merryman is in Berlin, the decision seems easy and she returns to Berlin. But disillusionment follows, their 'Merryman' was a swindler! But now she suddenly faces the real Mr. Merryman. And he hires Jou-Jou – and only so that he can finally get his peace from her. Since all this damn hype about Jou-Jou and their dream of making a movie business almost destroyed Willy's friendship for both of them, Willy II bravely steps in front of the real Mr. Merryman and gives him a tongue-in-cheek tongue-in-cheek.

72355109	A Blonde Woman	thumb|300px|A Blonde Woman (Flora) A Blonde Woman, also called Flora, is an oil painting by Palma Vecchio, dated today to around 1520, but undocumented before 1870, in the collection of the National Gallery, London. This half- length depiction of a woman in loosened white chemise with a dark green mantle, holding some flowers, has been interpreted as an idealised representation of female beauty (sometimes in connection with the Roman goddess Flora), and as an actual portrait of either a gentlewoman or a courtesan. ==Description== The picture was painted in oils on a wood panel measuring 77.5 cm by 64.1 cm (2 ft 6½ in by 2 ft 3¾ in); a strip 2.54 cm (1 in) high has been added along the top of the panel, lengthening it. It is in very good condition, with most of the repainting concentrated in the side of the face and hair which is cast in shadow.Gould 1975; repr. 1987, p. 187. The subject is a young woman with fair skin and blonde carefully tended silken hair sweeping about her shoulders, who shows much décolletée; her white chemise or camicia is unfastened and slipping off her shoulder, baring her right breast and nipple, and there is a little piece of narrow blue ribbon, designed to fasten the chemise. In her right hand is a small bunch of colourful spring flowers.Richter 1910, i. p. 129.Richter 1910, i. pp. 133–134.Kren, et al., eds. 2018, p. 346. ==Date== By comparing Palma's treatment of the subject's coiffure with similar styles in pictures by contemporary Venetian artists, such as Lorenzo Lotto, the picture has been dated to about 1520.Gould 1975; repr. 1987, p. 188. Jean Paul Richter, writing in 1910, thought the picture representative of Palma's work during the previous decade, from 1510 to 1520, and allied in composition with the "beautiful series of portraits" now preserved in the Gallery of Vienna.Richter 1910, i. p. 130. The work has been compared to Palma's Sibyl, which is also dated to the 1520s.Royal Collection Trust. In Venus and Cupid in a Landscape, another work by Palma, dated by the Fitzwilliam Museum, where it hangs, to about 1523 or 1524,Fitzwilliam Museum. Venus has the same dimpled chin, and other facial features, as the subject of this painting. ==Analysis== Palma Vecchio is known mainly for religious scenes and portraits of women, and, according to Cecil Gould, this example of the latter group is characteristic of his style.Gould 1975; repr. 1987, pp. 184–185.Humfrey 1995, p. 167. The subject is a young woman of that "opulent voluptuous type", in Richter's phrase, which was much admired in Venice at the beginning of the sixteenth century, and was represented in works by Titian, Palma, Lorenzo Lotto, Bonifazio Veronese, Paris Bordone, and others.Richter 1910, i. p. 133. The character of these works is disputed, as to whether the women represented are simply ideals of female beauty created by the artist, or portraits of actually existing beauties, and, if portraits, of whom.Philipps 1905, p. 26.Humfrey 1995, pp. 167–168. In the National Gallery catalogues, this picture was for many years titled Flora after the ancient Roman goddess of spring and flowers.Richter 1910, i. pp. 129–130. Certain particularities of the composition, such as the posy of forget-me-nots, buttercups (or wall-flowers) and primroses held in the subject's right hand, and the erotic suggestion of the loosened chemise, have drawn comparison with Titian's earlier painting of the same name. Richter, who titles the work Portrait of a Lady, writes of the "cold whiteness" of the chemise which has fallen away from the shoulders, "like the discarded sheath of an opening flower".Richter 1910, i. pp. 129, 134. Gould thinks the influence of Titian likely, though unprovable given the dearth of primary sources for the picture. The identity of the sitter is unknown, and according to Gould impossible to determine given the "summary treatment of the features". Richter, conversely, describes Palma's "carefully individualised heads" of women as portraits.Richter 1910, i. p. 134. Palma painted a number of similar half-lengths of (real or ideal) beauties, and the type became one of his specialities. Such eroticised images were not intended for public exhibition, but to be hung in private apartments,Richter 1910, i. p. 135. and were commissioned by a clientele of wealthy male collectors. There is also evidence that some successful courtesans and mistresses bought and owned alluring portraits of themselves to advertise their charms.National Gallery. Portraits of such well-known women were ordered by their lovers and admirers, who were sometimes even pictured with them. Claude Phillips writes of "the exquisite, golden blond courtezans—or, if you will, models—who constantly appear and reappear in this period of Venetian art".Phillips 1897, p. 52. The connection extends to the name Flora, which was a common alias of prostitutes in Italy from Roman times.Jones 2012.Held 1961, pp. 202–203.Santore 2008, pp. 20–21. This painting has therefore been interpreted as "probably a portrait of a Venetian courtesan". According to Richter, however, although Palma's pictures of women may sometimes depict courtesans, they may equally often be portraits of great ladies, gentlewomen, and brides, whose husbands were simply proud of their beauty.Richter 1910, i. pp. 133–135. ==Provenance== Palma never signed or dated any of his canvases, and although this one is to-day attributed to him based on the style and handling of the composition, the documentation of the picture is completely lacking before 1870.Richter 1910, i. p. 131. On 30 April 1870 it was auctioned by Christie's as lot 53 of the William Delafield sale, with an attribution to Paris Bordone.Richter 1910, i. p. x. The picture was bought from a Dr. Becci in Florence, who had acquired it some time before in England, and was firmly convinced that it was by Leonardo da Vinci. It had previously belonged to a Mr. Delafield.Richter 1910, i. p. 136. It was acquired by Ludwig Mond in 1889, who, just before his death 1909, bequeathed it, along with the most of his collection of Old Master pictures, to the National Gallery, pending the death of his widow, Frida Mond, who lived until 1923.Wardleworth 2003, p. 88. In 1924, after settling a legal dispute with the family, the National Gallery acquired the picture (accession number NG3939) through the Mond bequest. Three copies or versions of the composition have between recorded: # Formerly in the collection of the Duke of Northumberland at Syon House, auctioned by Sotheby's on 26 March 1952 as lot 109. # From an anonymous sale, auctioned by Sotheby's on 12 December 1954 as lot 62. # Sold at Cologne in 1904. The sitter is described as wearing pearls.Spahn 1932, p. 126. == Allusions == * In his 1969 novel Ada or Ardor: A Family Chronicle, Vladimir Nabokov refers to this picture ("a Venetian blonde") and the painter ("a drunken Palma Vecchio").Nabokov 1969, p. 141.Shapiro 2014, p. 156. ==Related works== File:Portrait d'une Femme à sa Toilette, by Titian, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|Titian: Woman with a Mirror, File:Palma il Vecchio 006.jpg|Palma: Young Woman in a Green Dress, File:Jacopo Negretti, called Palma il Vecchio - Young Woman in a Blue Dress, with Fan - Google Art Project.jpg|Palma: Young Woman in a Blue Dress, with Fan, File:Palma il Vecchio - Mars, Venus and Cupid (1520).jpg|Palma: Mars, Venus and Cupid, File:Retrato de una mujer joven llamada "la Bella", por Palma el Viejo.jpg|Palma: "La Bella", File:Palma il Vecchio - Lady With A Lute.jpg|Palma: Lady with a Lute, File:Jacopo Negretti called Palma the Elder - Portrait of a Woman known as Portrait of a Courtesan - Google Art Project.jpg|Palma: A Courtesan, File:1520 Veneto Idealbildnis einer Kurtisane als Flora anagoria.JPG|Bartolomeo Veneto: Young Lady as Flora, File:Francesco Melzi Flora after 2019 conservation.jpg|Melzi: Flora, File:Palma Vecchio (active 1480-1528) - A Sibyl - RCIN 405763 - Royal Collection.jpg|Palma: A Sibyl, File:1525 il Vecchio Frau mit entbloesster Brust anagoria.JPG|Palma: Young Woman with Bare Breast, File:Jacopo Palma il vecchio (c.1480-1528) - Venus and Cupid - 109 - Fitzwilliam Museum.jpg|Palma: Venus and Cupid in a Landscape, File:Diana and Callisto - Palma Vecchio.jpg|Palma: Bathing Nymphs, File:Paris bordon, gli amanti veneziani, 1525-30 ca.

23233139	A Blood Pledge	A Blood Pledge (; also known as Whispering Corridors 5: A Blood Pledge and Suicide Pact) is a K-Horror film, and the fifth installment of the Whispering Corridors series of South Korean horror films set in girls' high schools that began with 1998's film of the same name. Aside from the setting and overall themes, it is unrelated to the other films in the series. ==Plot== The story begins with the pledge; Eun-Joo, So-Hee, Yoo-jin, and Eun-young pledge that they will die together that night. Eun-Joo jumps from the roof of her school, committing suicide. Her sister Jeong-Eun sees her jump. The next day in the school office, So-Hee admits that she was on the roof with Eun-Joo when she jumped. The three girls become paranoid about the death of Eun-Joo, and secrets about why each girl had a reason to jump-start to surface. So-Hee becomes depressed about the death, unlike the other two. Jeong-Eun confronts So-Hee about her sister's death but So-Hee repeats that she doesn't know what happened. Rumors start to spread around the school. Many girls accuse So-Hee of killing Eun-Joo as their relationship had become strained in the past year. Another girl claims that Eun-Joo killed herself because she was pregnant. That evening, Eun-young is beaten by her father for having low grades. The next day, she begs Yoo-jin to let her sleep at her home. So-Hee has flashbacks of the time when she was friends with Eun-Joo and feels guilty. Joo-yeon tells So-Hee that because she pushed Eun-Joo away, she is to blame for her death. Joo-Yeong is later killed by Eun-Joo. Eun-young sees Eun-Joo's ghost several times, which terrifies her. So-Hee finds a dismembered body, possibly Joo- Yeon's, in a classroom locker. Eun-young tells Yoo-jin that Eun-Joo promised she wouldn't kill any of them if they came clean. Later, Yoo-Jin and So-Hee see Eun-young on the roof. They beg her not to jump but she does, claiming that she is no longer afraid and that she feels good because she won't have to go back to her abusive home. So-Hee enters the church to apologize for her actions, followed by Yoo-jin. A flashback shows Soo-Hee with her boyfriend, Ki-Ho. Yoo-jin used to date Ki-Ho and made So-Hee and Eun-young stop being friends with Eun-Joo. In the present, Yoo-Jin says that she would kill herself if she didn't make top grades. Eun-young says she tried to kill herself last year because of her father, and So-Hee confesses her pregnancy. Yoo-jin says she doesn't want to lose to So-Hee again, who is better at schoolwork, and she and Eun-young decide to pretend to jump. Yoo-jin grabs So-Hee and ties a microphone around her neck, stringing her up. Eun-Joo storms in and strangles Yoo-jin. In a flashback, Eun-Joo had told So-Hee that she wanted to die together with So-Hee one day. However, on the day of Eun-Joo’s suicide, So-Hee confessed her pregnancy and swore that she was going to kill herself and take the baby with her. The four girls met on the roof, holding hands. Before the jump, Eun-young and Yoo-jin stepped back. So-Hee realized this and frantically tried to stop Eun-Joo but it was too late: Eun-Joo jumped to her death. The next scene is of So-Hee sobbing with Eun-Joo on the roof. Eun-Joo smiles and tells So-Hee that she missed her and wanted to return, but knew she would scare So-Hee. So-Hee hugs her and says she is sorry, begging Eun-Joo to take her with her. However, Jeong-Eun grabs So-Hee's hand, and Eun-Joo tells So-Hee that she must stay to take care of Jeong-Eun: So-Hee is now Jeong-Eun's older sister. Afterwards, So-Hee decides to keep the baby, while Ki-Ho has moved on with another girl. The two-step into an elevator, and as the door is closing, the girl's face turns into Eun-Joo's. == Cast == ; Main characters: * Oh Yeon- seo as Yoo-jin * Jang Kyung-ah as Eun-joo * Son Eun-seo as So-Hee * Song Chae- yoon as Eun-young * Yoo Shin-ae as Jung-eun ; Supporting characters: ==See also== * List of South Korean films of 2009 == References == == External links == * * * * Category:2009 films Category:2000s Korean-language films Category:2009 horror films Category:South Korean supernatural horror films Category:2000s South Korean films
20987461	A Bloody Aria	A Bloody Aria () is a 2006 South Korean black comedy film written and directed by Won Shin-Yeon, that starred Han Suk-Kyu, Lee Moon-Sik, Oh Dal-Soo, Lee Byung-Joon and Cha Ye-Ryun. The Los Angeles Times described the movie as a "thriller about a fated convergence of people from different strata of Korean society who queasily slide between roles of tormentor and victim." == Plot == An aspiring opera singer In-jeong travels to countryside with her college professor Yeong-seon. She wants to learn more about the outcome of her audition for a part in an upcoming opera performance. The two park on a deserted riverbank to make a campfire. Instead of talking about the audition, Yeong-seon tries to rape In-jeong who escapes to a forest. Yeong-seon wants to leave but his car gets stuck. Three local thugs with motorcycles discover the car and confront him. Meanwhile, In-jeong stops a man on a scooter who promises to take her to a public transport terminal after they meet his friends who are waiting at the river. As it turns out, he is the leader of the group and takes In-jeong back to the riverbank where she reunites with the scared Yeong-seon but the two do not admit knowing each other. The thugs eat roasted pork and have a small talk with the professor when a young student Hyeon-jae rolls out from a bag that was placed on one of the motorcycles. The thug leader starts harassing the boy. His behavior becomes more psychotic when In-jeong voices her disapproval. He orders the thugs to rape her and forces the student and Yeong-seon to fight until one of them drops. Hyeon-jae knows taekwondo and easily defeats Yeong-seon. He then proceeds to beat the thugs. With all of them unconscious, the boy digs a hole in the ground, buries the men up to their chests and pours gasoline on their heads preparing to set them on fire. Yeong-seon runs for help and In-jeong tries to stop the student. While she's talking to him, the leader regains consciousness and manages to hit the boy with a shovel and escape from the hole. After waking up, one of the thugs beats the injured boy so badly that all believe him dead. Meanwhile, Yeong-seon finds a police officer that fined him earlier that day and tells him about the thugs and the boy. The policeman happens to be the boy's older brother Moon-jae. When they arrive to the riverbank, they don't find anybody because the thugs locked the boy in the car's trunk and left to drive the car into the river at a different place. The boy eventually regains consciousness and shoots several times from a revolver he'd been hiding all the time. The car crashes and the policeman is able to find them. He recognizes the thug leader to be his former schoolmate Bong-yeon that he used to bully and physically abuse. The kidnapping and torture of his brother was meant to be a revenge for this abuse. The policeman proceeds with mocking and beating Bong- yeon in a manner that resembles his behavior at school. After beating him up, he leaves taking a small tin box from one of the thugs. The box originally contained cough powder but one of the thugs replaced it with a poison he used for catching birds. Believing it to be cocaine, the policeman samples the poison and dies shortly after becoming the only victim of the whole episode. == Cast == * Han Suk-Kyu as Moon-Jae, a policeman * Lee Moon-Sik as Bong-Yeon, a gang boss * Oh Dal-Soo as Oh-Geun, a gangster * Cha Ye-Ryun as In-Jung, a student of Young-Sun * Kim Shi-Hoo as Hyun-Jae, a victim * Lee Byung-Joon as Young-Sun, a professor of classical vocal music * Jung Kyung-Ho as Hong-Bae, a gangster * Shin Hyun-Tak as Won-Ryong, a gangster * Jin Yong-Ok as Tow truck driver == Release == A Bloody Aria was released in South Korea on 31 May 2006,"Box-Office Admission Results" (2006).

1930088	A Blossom Fell	"A Blossom Fell" is a popular song written by Howard Barnes, Harold Cornelius, and Dominic John and published in 1954. The best-known version was recorded by Nat King Cole. The recording was released by Capitol Records as catalog number 3095. The B-side was "If I May." The record first reached the Billboard magazine charts on April 27, 1955, and lasted 20 weeks on the chart, peaking at #2. (Note that in this era, Billboard combined data for both sides of two- sided hits, so the #2 status applies to the combination of "A Blossom Fell" and "If I May"). Nat King Cole recorded the song again for his album The Nat King Cole Story (1961). ==Other versions== *In the UK "A Blossom Fell" was even more popular with 3 cover versions to reach the UK charts: The first one was by Dickie Valentine who entered the UK listings on 18 February 1955 and climbed up to the # 10 spot. One week later the version by Nat King Cole appeared and outsold Valentines recording by reaching #3. Finally Ronnie Hilton's version charted at #10 a few weeks later. *Tony Bennett - Recorded June 9, 1955. *Diana Krall - All for You: A Dedication to the Nat King Cole Trio (1996) *Sue Raney - Songs for a Raney Day (1960). ==References== Category:1954 songs Category:1955 singles Category:Songs with lyrics by Howard Barnes Category:Nat King Cole songs
71001748	A Blot in the 'Scutcheon	A Blot in the 'Scutcheon is a tragedy in blank verse by Robert Browning, published in 1843 and acted in the same year.Keller 1924, p. 95. == Characters == * Mildred Tresham * Thorold, Earl Tresham * Henry, Earl Mertoun * Guendolen Tresham * Austin Tresham * Gerard, and other retainers of Lord Tresham Time, 17— == Synopsis == Mildred Tresham, only sister of Thorold, Earl Tresham, has been seduced by Henry, Earl Mertoun, whose lands adjoin those of her brother. Anxious to repair this wrong he formally requests her in marriage. Thorold, who knows nothing of his sister's fall, readily consents. But a retainer sees Mertoun climb to Mildred's chamber and informs his master, without being able to identify the intruder. Questioned by her brother, Mildred admits the truth of the story, but refuses to divulge her lover's name or to dismiss Earl Mertoun. Deeply wounded in his family pride, which is morbidly intense, Thorold is too emotionally stirred to infer that Mertoun and the lover are the same. Denouncing Mildred as a shameless woman he rushes into the park, where he wanders until midnight. Meanwhile, Mildred's cousin, Gwendolen, in a talk with Mildred, has divined the identity of Mertoun and the offender, and with her fiancé and the earl’s brother, Austin Tresham, goes out to find Thorold and to persuade him to forgiveness. They are too late, however. At midnight Thorold encounters Mertoun on his way to an interview with Mildred, and in his anger compelled him to fight a duel in which Mertoun, refusing to defend himself, is mortally wounded. Realizing at length his own harshness and injustice towards a boy who was penitent and eager to atone for his fault, Thorold exchanges forgiveness with Mertoun, and on his death, takes poison. He then goes to beg forgiveness of his sister who grants it and dies of a broken heart, closely followed by her brother. In dying he says that he leaves to Austin and Gwendolen an unblotted 'scutcheon. == Background == Browning's dramatic period extended from 1835 to the time of his marriage in 1846, and produced some nine plays, not all of which, however, were intended for the stage. Paracelsus, the first of the series, has been described as a "conversational drama", and Pippa Passes, though it has been staged, is essentially a poem to read. The historical tragedy of Strafford has been performed, but King Victor and King Charles, The Return of the Druses, Colombe's Birthday, A Soul's Tragedy, and Luria, while interesting in many ways, have not been regarded as successful stage-plays.Eliot, ed. 1909, p. 358. == Performance == A Blot in the 'Scutcheon was published in 1843 as the fifth number (No. V) of Bells and Pomegranates.Birch, ed. 2009. In a letter to John Forster, dated 25 November 1842, Charles Dickens wrote enthusiastically of Browning's play: "[It] has thrown me into a perfect passion of sorrow … I know nothing that is so affecting, nothing in any book I have ever read, as Mildred's recurrence to that "I was so young—I had no mother."'Roberts 2011. The play was performed at Drury Lane in 1843, but its chances of a successful run were spoiled by the jealousy of William Macready, the manager, and it ran for only three nights. It was presented again, under the management of Samuel Phelps, in 1848.Clarke 1920, p. 213. == Reception == The catastrophe has been criticised as not inevitable and the speeches as too analytical for the stage, but the pathos and tragic power of this drama have also received praise. == References == == Sources == * Birch, Dinah, ed.

17490919	A Blueprint for Murder	A Blueprint for Murder is a 1953 American film noir thriller film directed and written by Andrew L. Stone and starring Joseph Cotten, Jean Peters and Gary Merrill.. ==Plot== Whitney "Cam" Cameron (Joseph Cotten) arrives at a hospital to be with his widowed sister-in-law Lynne (Jean Peters), whose stepdaughter Polly has died under mysterious circumstances. A doctor cannot determine the cause of the child's death. Cam has great affection for his young nephew Doug (Freddy Ridgeway). He begins to fear for the boy's life when Maggie Sargent (Catherine McLeod), the wife of his lawyer, Fred (Gary Merrill), mentions that the dead girl's symptoms sound suspiciously as if she had been poisoned. Fred reveals that the will of Cam's brother, who also died from unspecified causes, put all his money into a trust for the boy. Lynne would inherit it all if anything happened to Doug. Police, prodded by Cam, exhume the girl's body. Poison is found and Lynne is brought to court, but a judge dismisses the charges for a lack of evidence against her. A desperate Cam cannot think of any way to keep Doug safe, particularly once Lynne decides to take the boy away to Europe for at least a year. Cam surprises them by turning up on the ocean voyage. He begins romancing Lynne, all the while plotting to poison her. He slips a tablet from her belongings into a cocktail. Lynne goes to great lengths to castigate Cam for his suspicions and demonstrate that the tablet contained nothing but aspirin. Cam leaves her stateroom, but a few minutes later Lynne's life is saved by the ship's doctor, proving that she did indeed possess poison. A court soon sentences Lynne to prison for life. ==Cast== * Joseph Cotten as Whitney 'Cam' Cameron * Jean Peters as Lynne Cameron * Gary Merrill as Fred Sargent * Catherine McLeod as Maggie Sargent * Jack Kruschen as Detective Lt. Harold Y. Cole * Barney Phillips as Detective Capt. Pringle * Freddy Ridgeway as Doug Cameron (as Fred Ridgeway) ==Reception== The film received a mostly negative review in The New York Times upon its opening. The film critic wrote, "Andrew Stone, the writer-director who flavored last season's The Steel Trap with such intriguing semi-documentary finesse, misses by a good mile in his latest case history, A Blueprint for Murder ... However, Mr. Stone's plodding fixation on conventionalized justice, redundantly stressed in the hero's narration, sidesteps any surprises along the way. Indeed, it loses conviction altogether before the climax, when he traps the culprit aboard an ocean liner, squiring her intended victim and enough strychnine—as Mr. Cotten accuses her, twice—to choke a horse. 'This farce', replies the understandably surly Miss Peters, 'has gone on long enough.'"The New York Times, film review, "New Suspense Film Opens at Palace", July 25, 1953. Accessed: July 6, 2013. Recently, Craig Butler of AllMovie was more positive. He writes "A Blueprint for Murder is a moderately entertaining crime thriller ... A bit more imagination would have brought a higher level of excitement to the film. However, Blueprint does benefit from a fine cast ... there's enough going on in Blueprint to make up for many of its flaws." ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:1953 films Category:1950s crime thriller films Category:American crime thriller films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American detective films Category:Film noir Category:Films directed by Andrew L.

16856735	A Blueprint for Survival	A Blueprint for Survival was an influential environmentalist text that drew attention to the urgency and magnitude of environmental problems. First published as a special edition of The Ecologist in January 1972, it was later published in book form and went on to sell over 750,000 copies.About the Ecologist, www.theecologist.org The Blueprint was signed by over thirty of the leading scientists of the day—including Sir Julian Huxley, Sir Frank Fraser Darling, Sir Peter Medawar, E. J. Mishan and Sir Peter Scott. It was largely written by Edward Goldsmith and Robert Allen (with contributions from John Davoll and Sam Lawrence of the Conservation Society, and Michael AllabyFantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain by Meredith Veldman. Cambridge University Press, 1994. p230) who argued for a radically restructured society in order to prevent what the authors referred to as “the breakdown of society and the irreversible disruption of the life-support systems on this planet”. It recommended that people live in small, decentralised and largely de-industrialised communities. Some of the reasons given for this were that: * it is too difficult to enforce moral behaviour in a large community * agricultural and business practices are more likely to be ecologically sound in smaller communities * people feel more fulfilled in smaller communities * reducing an area's population reduces the environmental impact The authors used tribal societies as their model which, it was claimed, were characterised by their small, human-scale communities, low-impact technologies, successful population controls, sustainable resource management, holistic and ecologically integrated worldviews, and a high degree of social cohesion, physical health, psychological well-being and spiritual fulfilment of their members.The Stable Society by Edward Goldsmith.

13007246	A Blues for Shindig	A Blues for Shindig is a gritty crime novel based in 1950s Soho and written by Mo Foster. Foster has said that parts of the novel are autobiographical, as this London-born author spent her early teens in the streets of edgy Soho. Foster was addicted to heroin and ran in beatnik circles, rubbing elbows with William S. Burroughs and Colin MacInnes. Inspired by MacInnes' real life depiction of London in his novel, City of Spades, Foster set out to write a short story that conveyed the same era from the perspective of strong woman. She wrote and rewrote the story of Shindig over twenty years. Foster recently suffered a stroke that prompted her to finish the manuscript for Shindig and send it out to publishers. A Blues for Shindig was published by PaperBooks in 2006. ==Plot summary== Shindig is a young woman who survives the rough streets of London's Soho neighborhood by working in an illegal bar and selling drugs in the alleys. Shindig's daily life is populated by abusers, boozers, losers, crooked cops and gangsters. Yet these seemingly deviant characters look out for one another and Shindig navigates through this underworld with a sense of adventure. Yet, she soon finds herself caught in the middle of a much larger power play. ==External links== * Guardian interview with Mo Foster Category:2006 British novels Category:Novels set in London Category:Novels set in the 1950s

50567457	A Boat Load of Home Folk	A Boat Load of Home Folk (1968) is a novel by Australian author Thea Astley. == Plot summary == The novel follows a group of passengers on a cruise ship docked at a Pacific Island as a hurricane approaches. ==Critical reception== In The Canberra Times Liam Mason noted that the reader was able to sympathise with the novel's characters: "There is also an almost depressing realism in Miss Astley's resolutions of her characters' crises: the failure of a friend, the failure of a marriage, the failure of a priest, the failure (at the most trivial level) of a womaniser in a would-be seduction. For there is not necessarily any solution. Nor need there be a new start after the ritual of death and disaster.""Under the Surface of a Hot Summer" By Liam Mason, The Canberra Times, 7 September 1968, p14 Michael Wilding, writing in Southerly found a lot to like about the book, but also had some reservations: "The precision of the writing, the spareness and clarity, are immediately appealing. But as the novel progresses the lack of any substantial content lets the writing drift towards the somewhat consciously fine, and the religious references—the recurrent calvaries, crucifixions and expiations, become obtrusive.""Writer and Reader" by Michael Wilding, Southerly, Vol 30, No 1, 1970, pp72-73 ==See also== * 1968 in literature ==References== Category:Novels by Thea Astley Category:1968 Australian novels Category:Angus & Robertson books

Suspecting that the men he seeks have fled to Britain, Falco accepts the mission and travels there with his wife, two baby daughters, their nurse, and his two brothers-in-law Aelianus and Justinus.

7690541	A Bold Stroke for a Wife	A Bold Stroke for a Wife is Susanna Centlivre's 18th-century satirical English play first performed in 1718. The plot expresses the author's unabashed support of the British Whig Party: she criticises the Tories, religious hypocrisy, and the greed of capitalism. ==Synopsis== Set in 18th-century England, the play tells the story of a military officer who wants to marry a young woman. His obstacles are the four guardians who watch over Anne Lovely. Each of the four has his own idea of the ideal husband. The catch is that each is disagreeable in his own way, and they can't possibly see eye to eye on a man for Anne. To gain Miss Lovely's hand in marriage, soldier Colonel Fainwell must convince the four guardians that he will make an ideal husband. Fainwell takes the bold stroke of wearing elaborate disguises, four of which mimic the personalities and occupations of each of the guardians in turn: an antiquarian, an old beau, a Quaker, and an exchange broker. In all, Fainwell dons the guise of a preening fop, a mysterious world traveler, a shuffling country steward, a dimwitted Dutchman and a fire-and-brimstone preacher in turn. The fire-and-brimstone Quaker character impersonated by Fainwell is Simon Pure, and one point of the plot is to discover the "real" Simon Pure. Fainwell gets the guardians' permission to wed Lovely but before the marriage can take place, the real Simon Pure shows up at the end to prove his identity. ==Characters== ===Main=== :Colonel Fainwell is the protagonist in this play, going after the consent of the four guardians to receive Anne Lovely's hand in marriage. Helped by his friend Freeman, he resorts to impersonations and deceitful behaviours to gain the consent of the four guardians by transforming himself into the ideal husband each guardian seeks. :Anne Lovely is the damsel in distress held hostage by the four guardians. She seeks an exit from them and relies on Fainwell to obtain consent from her guardians to gain her freedom. She has a massive amount of money that comes with her when she marries after the guardians give consent. She changes her life style and attitude for each guardian she stays with, as she has to stay with each of the guardians for three months per year. ===Guardians=== *Periwinkle is described as an antique collector, his wardrobe collection is made up of clothes of fashion from the last century, and he follows the words of the author of a collection of travellers' tales Sir John Mandeville more than the words of the Bible. Deception to obtain his consent fails the first time, but is successful the second time when he is tricked into signing the consent when presented with the false lease for his uncle's estate. *Tradelove is described as a stickler for trade, hates anything that comes with a sword, and is a great admirer of Dutch traders believing they understand trade better than any other nation. It is also noted that he is devilish in his dealings, as he cheated his father for the advantage of stock to get a bargain. He is encouraged to offer his consent to marry Anne Lovely to the Dutch trader in lieu of the payment of two thousand pounds wagered. *Sir Philip Modelove is described as a "beau." He is an old fashioned man who dresses fancy by keeping with the new fashions, and is the cheapest of the whole company on birthdays. He admires the French and enjoys the French operas, balls, and masquerades. Approving Colonel Fainwell's French behaviours and high class appearance, he gives his consent and introduces Fainwell to the rest of the guardians. *Obadiah Prim is a very rigid Quaker. At the start of the play Anne Lovely is seen entering Prim's house to start her three-month stay with him. He believes those who are not Quakers are impure. He is deceived by Colonel Fainwell when he impersonates Simon Pure and gives his consent when he is convinced Colonel Fainwell had converted Lovely. ===Other=== :Mrs. Prim, Obadiah's wife, berates Anne Lovely for not being a Quaker and for her appearance and choices in clothes. :Betty is Anne Lovely's maid and only friend. :Simon Pure is a Quaker preacher from Pennsylvania who comes to visit Obadiah Prim. His visit creates an entrance for Colonel Fainwell and is impersonated by him. :Freeman is Colonel Fainwell's friend, dedicated to helping Fainwell achieve his goals with Anne Lovely. He initially introduces Fainwell to his difficult task and directly helps obtain consent from Tradelove by the levering a wager the merchant has lost. Freeman also keeps an eye out for Colonel Fainwell during his impersonation of Simon Pure and sends in a false letter to help. :Sackbut is the tavern keeper. He describes each guardian to Colonel Fainwell and also helps Fainwell with his goal of obtaining consent from them. ==Summary== ===Act 1=== The act starts with Colonel Fainwell and Freeman at the local tavern as Colonel Fainwell is talking of love. He has seen Anne Lovely earlier in the day and inquires about her of his friend Freeman, who calls upon the Tavern owner Sackbut to tell Fainwell about the four guardians who were left with the care of Lovely and her fortune. It is revealed that her father wished Lovely dead a thousand times because he wished the world would end on his passing. Since fortune was to be passed down to Lovely, the father arranged it so that in order for Lovely to marry, she had to get the consent of all four guardians. Each of the guardians had their own view of the ideal husband in ways that contradicted each other making it impossible for a universal agreement among the four men. Lovely spends three months of each year at each of the guardians' residences. Her three months with Prim begins as the action opens. With promises of help from Freeman and Sackbut, Fainwell plans on obtaining the consent of the guardians, beginning with Sir Philip Modelove. During Fainwell's meeting with his friends, Lovely and her assistant Betty discuss Lovely's situation with the guardians. Lovely is sick and tired of being subjected to the "preposterous humours" of people in town and being pointed at. Lovely brings up that Colonel Fainwell had promised her freedom from her situation and mentions that she likes the Colonel above all the men she has ever seen. ====Key points==== Fainwell's method of obtaining consent is to assume the identity of the ideal gentleman to each guardian. Since he has no chance in obtaining consent as himself from all four guardians simultaneously, he is forced to get consent individually. The Colonel only needs to deceive each guardian long enough to receive consent to marry Anne Lovely while disguised as the guardian's ideal husband. ===Act 2=== Colonel Fainwell shows up at the park dressed nicely to impress Sir Philip with a few footmen to show off. Fainwell is supposedly dressed in a French style which attracts the attention of Sir Philip as Colonel approaches him. Once they begin to "praise one another", the woman sitting with Sir Philip leaves and the Colonel says everything that Sir Philip wants to hear. Sir Philip gives his consent and they arrange for Fainwell to be introduced personally to the other three guardians. At Obadiah Prim's house, Mrs. Prim and Anne Lovely argue about Lovely's choice of dress, Mrs. Prim saying it is too revealing. Lovely argues back saying Mrs. Prim is a prude and a believer of Quaker to Quaker relations. Mr. Prim enters and states that Lovely's breasts are too exposed and that she should hide them with a handkerchief, also stating that it inflames desire in other men. Lovely is upset and declares that her father never meant the tyranny of guardianship to control her life, while Mr. Prim defends himself by stating that all he meant was to prevent her from wearing temping attire and provoking others to sin. Sir Philip and Fainwell arrive at Prim's house and Fainwell is introduced to Mr. Prim formally for the first time. Then he is introduced to Lovely and as he goes to kiss her hand, he attempts to give her a letter which she drops and Prim picks up. After Fainwell reveals to Lovely who he really is, Lovely realizes she had made a mistake refusing his letter. She snatches the letter away from Prim and shreds it before anyone can take it back from her. The other guardians arrive and Fainwell is introduced to Periwinkle and Tradelove. Both guardians question Colonel Fainwell, determine that they disapprove of Sir Philip's suggestion, and leave declaring their requirement that all of their personal qualifications be met. ====Key Points==== We see in this act that Sir Philip is a fop. He has very big interests in Fashion and is made to believe the Colonel is a higher figure than he really is. The Colonel plays every card he knows to mirror Sir Philip's personality to make them seem to "…appear to have but one soul, for our ideas and conceptions are the same."(Act 2, Scene 1, 83–85). In the next scene, we see how Lovely rejects Quaker strictures and notions of 'modesty.' Mr. and Mrs. Prim's characteristics are revealed even more when the point about romance between Quakers is accepted even with temptation being involved, but if they are not Quakers, it is evil and is looked down upon. It is reconfirmed that the disapproval of the other guardians is unanimous, as each fails to see the Colonel as one of his own kind. ===Act 3=== Act three starts with Sackbut congratulating Colonel Fainwell for obtaining the consent of at least one of the guardians. The Colonel is in an Egyptian dress, disguised as a foreigner, to meet Periwinkle. Periwinkle is intrigued by not only the foreign appearance of Fainwell, but also the antique "habits" the Colonel displays. Periwinkle asks Fainwell if he has collected any rarities, as odd trinkets capture his interest, even asking if he's had a crocodile. Fainwell plays it off saying that he possesses more worthy knowledge than would be shown by possession of such petite items. He claims that he has great knowledge of the sun, more than what Descartes has claimed to discover and find out. With Periwinkle astonished and jealous, Fainwell lists a slew of items with claims of outrageous things they can do. He finishes off the list with a typical girdle claiming it has the power to make the wearer invisible and able to teleport instantaneously. Fainwell explains that in order for the girdle to work, the others in the room must face east. After the explanation Periwinkle tries on the girdle, Fainwell and Sackbut turn towards the east, and when they turn back, they pretend that Periwinkle disappeared. Not convinced, Periwinkle requests that the Colonel try the girdle on. Fainwell agrees and when Periwinkle and Sackbut turn east, Fainwell hides underneath a trap door so that when Periwinkle turns back, the illusion of invisibility is played out. After the demonstration, Sackbut raises a point saying that if Periwinkle would purchase the girdle and use it, he would be able to travel as he always wanted to. The Colonel says that the girdle would never change ownership for money and reveals that the point of his trip is to find the guardians of Lovely and win their consent in his marriage suit. The first guardian to give consent would receive the girdle, and Periwinkle declares that he is one of the four guardians of Lovely. Right when the agreement is to be signed and finalized, a drawer of the tailor reveals to Periwinkle that the foreigner is actually Colonel Fainwell, ruining Fainwell's plans. Fainwell flees immediately and Freeman enters to set forth the backup plan. Freeman informs Periwinkle that his uncle is dying and suggests that he make a trip to the estate despite it being far away. Periwinkle thanks Freeman, leaves, and the Colonel and Sackbut re-enter with the plan of going after the next guardian, Tradelove. ====Key Points==== Fainwell is dressed up as a foreigner armed with a "unique" item that is so intriguing to Periwinkle, Fainwell could demand anything and would likely receive it. Strangely enough, the item Fainwell uses is called "moros musphonon", meaning mousetrap for a fool in Greek. Periwinkle is indeed a fool and is easily manipulated into believing the girdle's abilities. He is also a fool for easily believing the disguised Fainwell was the nephew of his admirer John Tradescant. ===Act 4=== Act four opens at the Exchange Alley where all the stock action takes place with Tradelove looking busy. Freeman enters with Fainwell disguised as a Dutch trader with news saying the Spanish had raised their siege of Cagliari. The note states that no one would know right now, but in a few hours it will go public and this would be the perfect opportunity to make money. Tradelove and Freeman both make transactions that they think will bear fruit, and Freeman mentions to Tradelove that the Colonel has no idea of the potential opportunity present. Tradelove insists that the siege has been raised while Fainwell holds his end maintaining that it has not. Result: Tradelove lays down a money bet. With the bet made, Fainwell and Freeman make it back to Sackbut's Tavern to plan for Periwinkle's opening with his dying uncle. Before they get started, Sackbut enters with a letter addressed to Prim, introducing him to Simon Pure, a Quaker leader. Fainwell plans on impersonating this Simon Pure to try to secure consent from Mr. Prim. Sackbut prepares Quaker clothes and also provides the country dress Fainwell is to wear as the steward of Periwinkle's uncle. Tradelove shows up at the tavern seeking Freeman's audience. Fainwell disguised as the steward sneaks out, Freeman meets with Tradelove who immediately brings up that the letter Freeman received earlier was a fake. Tradelove loses the bet he made with Fainwell at the exchange and is unable to pay it. Freeman suggests that Tradelove offer his consent to marry off Anne Lovely without mentioning to the Colonel that he would still require the consent of the other three guardians. Tradelove agrees to this proposal and tells Freeman to ask the "Dutch Trader" to accept this proposal in satisfaction of the two thousand pounds wagered. The scene shifts to the Colonel disguised as the steward at Periwinkle's house informing him of his uncle's death. Fainwell now as "Pillage" sobs in between lines to make it seem like the uncle's death greatly impacts his life. Fainwell brings up the contents of the uncle's will, and lastly mentioning "his" lease needs to be renewed with the approval of Periwinkle. Periwinkle approves, and as he inspects the pen Fainwell hands him, Fainwell switches the lease for the consent contract and Periwinkle signs the consent form unknowingly. With the form in hand, Fainwell leaves Periwinkle's house and returns to the tavern where Freeman and Tradelove are waiting. Before the Colonel has a chance to make an appearance, Tradelove praises the generosity of the Dutch trader for accepting the proposal of his consent for marriage in lieu of the two thousand pound payment. The Colonel, now dressed as the Dutch trader, enters and secures the deal for consent, with Sackbut and Freeman as witnesses of the signing. Tradelove leaves, claiming he will put in a good word with the other guardians as he made the Dutch trader believe he was the main man in charge of Anne Lovely's marriage affairs. On Periwinkle's way out, he is smiling, thinking that he has bested the Dutch Trader, gaining relief for his debt at the small price of his consent for a still impossible marriage. ====Key Points==== Tradelove is seen to admire Dutch traders, claiming they know stocks and trade best of all nations, and yet he makes a wager with confidence against the Colonel based on the letter Freeman shows him. He shows his cocky behaviour, hoping to finally outwit a Dutch trader, and his trust in Freeman by accepting the information in the letter. After Tradelove finds out about his ruin, he offers consent for the trader to marry Lovely in lieu of his payment. He emphasizes that he is the leader of all the guardians in charge of Lovely's marriage plans, saying that he would not give up the consent easily. The deceit is played out and accepted by the Colonel, making Tradelove feel like a winner when in reality he is the loser. At Periwinkle's house, all goes according to plan; Fainwell acts as if the death was a true tragedy to help prove that the circumstances are genuine. He brings up the lease signing to get a signature one way or another, switching it with the consent contract to secure Anne Lovely from Periwinkle's end. The arrival of Simon Pure's letter was not originally in the plans and represents a godsend for Fainwell, an opportunity to win Prim's consent to marry Anne Lovely. ===Act 5=== The act starts at Prim's house with Mrs. Prim and Anne Lovely arguing over Lovely's choice in dress. Lovely declares that she wishes to dress in whatever fashion she desires and claims that Mrs. Prim would have never attracted any man with the way she dresses. Mrs. Prim counters that she did indeed attract many men while properly dressed. Loveley, she says, is too familiar with wicked people. The guardians all enter and all claim that they have found a husband for Lovely. As each speaks, a different guardian shoots the candidate down, despite, unbeknownst to them, each candidate being the same person. Prim is the only one without a candidate to marry Lovely, which changes quickly when a servant announces that Simon Pure, the Colonel in disguise, has arrived. The Colonel enters in a Quaker's outfit as Lovely and Mrs. Prim re-enter to greet the "guest." As Lovely enters, Fainwell cannot help but stare at her. Prim notices this and asks why Fainwell stares, to which he responds that he had a dream and saw Lovely in it. Prim interprets this as Lovely being converted and leaves with Mrs. Prim to have Fainwell convert Lovely so she will become a faithful Quaker. Lovely does not recognize Fainwell in his Quaker disguise and shrieks when he approaches her initially. Fainwell reveals his identity to calm her down. Due to the shriek, Prim investigates, but Lovely explains she shrieked because of Fainwell's non-stop blabber about converting her into a Quaker. Convinced, Prim exits once again to leave Fainwell and Lovely alone. Fainwell explains to Lovely that he has the consent of the other three guardians and only needs Prim's to marry her. Lovely plays along with Fainwell, faking that she has indeed converted to a Quaker. Prim is convinced that Lovely is converted. Then a servant enters and informs Prim that the real Simon Pure has arrived. Once Simon Pure has arrived, Fainwell's deception holds because a counterfeit letter is brought in, stating that there would be an imposter dressed as a Quaker with a mob to rob and kill Prim. Fainwell accuses Simon of being the imposter and Lovely adds on saying that she saw Simon with said mob, convincing Prim to dismiss the real Simon Pure. Fainwell realizes his time under cover is short, so he acts quickly and explains that Lovely would not be left alone by the Sathan and Lovely displays attitudes as if the spirits have filled her. Convinced, Prim gives his consent for Fainwell to marry Lovely and signs the papers, only for Simon to return with proof of his identity. Since Fainwell has obtained the consent, he no longer has any reason to deceive anyone anymore and admits that he was the false Simon Pure. All the guardians enter with Freeman and realize that they have all been deceived as Fainwell exposes his many identities to them. ====Key Points==== Fainwell's disguise as a Quaker admits him to the household of Prim and wins acceptance from him and his wife. After Lovely discovers his disguise, her acting helps persuade Prim that she has been converted, hence the speedy consent approval. The counterfeit letter that mentions an imposter could have gone both ways. With Fainwell's aggression and Lovely's assistance, Simon is forced to leave, and he is gone long enough for Fainwell to obtain the consent form from Prim. The letter had not been pre-planned, but the Colonel recognizes Freeman's handwriting, and his handywork. Freeman has kept watch, on the look-out for the arrival of the real Simon Pure. ==Analysis== Centlivre made fun of all the stereotypes of her time, fearlessly sending up the marriage mart, fashion, commerce, academia and even religion.Kistler, Julie. (15 April 2005) Pantagraph (Bloomington, IL). Illinois Wesleyan theater takes a 'Bold' step forward. Pg. D. ==History== A Bold Stroke for a Wife was first performed at the Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre, on 3 February 1718, where it ran six nights, which was considered a substantial success. The original cast included James Spiller as Periwinkle, William Bullock as Tradelove, George Pack as Obadiah, Christopher Bullock as Colonel Fainwell, John Ogden as Freeman, Jane Rogers as Mrs Lovely and Mary Kent as Mrs Prim. During its long life the play became very popular in the United States. It was produced as early as 1782 (in Baltimore). In 1786 a Charleston, South Carolina, journalist commented that "The Bold Stroke for a Wife . . . is one of the few comedies that has stood the test of time -- it is full of business and intrigue and abounds with such a variety as always arrests and keeps up the attention of the audience until it ends."Charleston[SC]Morning Post 10 October 1786 The play continued to find American audiences into the nineteenth century, and was billed as a "fine old comedy" when it was presented at Wallack's Theatre on Broadway in 1863. In 1960, this play was adapted as the film 'Ek Phool Chaar Kaante' (A Rose and Four Thorns) starring Sunil Dutt and Waheeda Rehman. The four guardians were portrayed by the then four most famous character actors of contemporary Bollywood- David, Dhumal, Rashid Khan and Johnny Walker. In a 1985 production by Double Edge TheatreDouble Edge Theatre of Boston, MA, was founded in 1982, and tries to incorporate 'living culture' into all of its productions. In some ways this can be compared to the concept of 'third theatre.' See Miller, David. (June 1995). TDR (Cambridge, Mass.), MIT Press. Songs at the well: Double Edge Theatre. (Boston, Massachusetts). Pg. 115. the play was set in the androgynous cabaret world of the 1920s as an ironic look at "the marriage game" written by an 18th-century male impersonator to underscore its cross-gender casting and the wry implications such an approach has in contemporary society.McLaughlin , Jeff. The Boston Globe. N.E. Life to Sponsor Performance Series. Section: Arts and Film. Pg. 58. ==Contribution to language== right|thumb|Cast list from first printing, 1718 ===Simon Pure=== Like the character of Mrs. Malaprop in Sheridan's play The Rivals, the name Simon Pure soon became a noun for a quality in a person. In Mrs. Malaprop's case, that quality was incorrect usage of a word by substituting a similar- sounding word with different meaning, usually with comic effect. In Simon's case, that quality was authenticity and in Simon's impersonator's case, that quality was hypocrisy.Safire, William. (3 June 1984). The New York Times. On Language; Taint So. Section 6; Pg. 614. In adjectival use, the compound quickly gained a hyphen and lost its capitals when, in 1894, William Dean Howells wrote glowingly of "American individuality, the real, simon-pure article." As in boycott from Captain Boycott and bloomer from Amelia Bloomer, names turn into words and lose their capital letters in eponymy. As a noun, Simon Pure is two words; as an adjective, it is lowercase and still holds the hyphen. That keeps the adjectival form untainted. The fact that there were two Simon Pures on stage is probably the reason the term became a confusing one. Depending on how it's used, it can mean either an honest man or a hypocrite who makes a great show of virtue.Miami Herald. (12 July 1985). Front Section. Pg. 25D. In modern usage, Simon Pure has become the source of two expressions: the phrase "The real Simon Pure", meaning "the real man"; and the adjective "simon-pure", meaning either # of genuine, untainted purity or integrity; or # pretentiously, superficially or hypocritically virtuous. In 1984, the term "simon-pure" received some publicity when Ambassador Robert Morris at the United States State Department conceded that the United States had taken some steps toward economic protectionism, but insisted, "If we are not simon-pure, we remain fairly credible."Safire, William. (3 June 1984). The New York Times. On Language; Taint So. Section 6; Pg. 614. As reported by then-The New York Times columnist William Safire, the phrase simon-pure means "untainted." In this context, delegates to conventions who are unencumbered by charges of being the creatures of ill-gotten fundsThat is to say, their presence at the convention is not the direct or indirect result of bribes are simon-pure delegates. ==References== * A Bold Stroke for a Wife, Broadview Press 1995 printing, . * "The Questors Presents A Bold Stroke for a Wife by Susanna Centilivre", The Questors Theatre, June 1954 * "A Bold Stroke for a Wife to Take Mainstage at IWU" Illinois Wesleyan University School of Theatre Arts, 30 March 2005 * Definition of simon-pure Merriam-Webster online dictionary * "Simon-pure", The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, Houghton Mifflin Company, 2004.

71358147	A Bolt of Lightning (Studio One)	"A Bolt of Lightning" was an American television play broadcast on November 12, 1951, as part of the CBS television series, Studio One. It was a historical drama portraying James Otis Jr. (1725–1783) and his 1761 prosecution of the Paxton's case, contesting Britain's use of writs of assistance to conduct warrantless searches of the colonists' property. Charlton Heston, at age 28, starred as Otis. The running time was 60 minutes including breaks hosted by Betty Furness, promoting Westinghouse refrigerators, electric roaster ovens, food crafters, and "odor-out" bulbs. ==Plot== ===Part 1=== In the opening scene, Otis leaves his law office in the evening. He passes Robinson, the crown's customs collector. Robinson and two others enter the home of John Emory. Robinson searches Emory's house for papers concerning contraband cargo of molasses and rum allegedly transported by ship to Boston. The search is conducted without a search warrant but rather on the basis of a writ of assistance, a legal process that had been declared illegal by the English courts. Robinson's men proceed to ransack Emory's house. At a public house, Samuel Adams recounts the colonists' grievances against the crown. Emory arrives and tells Adams what has happened at his house. Adams and Emory visit Otis's house. They tell Otis what happened and ask for Otis's assistance in voiding writs of assistance. Otis initially demurs, noting that as advocate general it is his duty to defend the writs. Adams appeals to Otis's conscience to stand up to the viciousness of Robinson and Governor Bernard. Otis agrees to speak to the Governor. A second merchant appeals to Otis to represent him in challenging the writs of assistance. Otis's sister, Mercy Warren, overhears the merchant's appeal and urges Otis to side with the people of Boston. Otis worries that standing against the Governor will damage his career. At a party attended by the Governor, Otis is asked about rumors that he intends to represent a group of merchants in challenging the legality of writs of assistance. Otis says he has been approached and that he is considering the matter. Otis asks the Governor to consider voluntarily abandoning the writs. The Governor orders Otis that, as advocate general, he must defend the writs in Court. Otis refuses to defend an illegal act and resigns his post. Part one closes with Otis at home after the party. He watches a lightning storm with his daughter, Mary, and says, "I've always had a curious feeling that, when God almighty in his providence should take me from time into eternity, it should be by a bolt of lightning." ===Part 2=== Otis asks Sam Adams to review the speech that he will deliver in court the next day, attacking the writs of assistance. Otis's wife scolds Adams for destroying Otis's career and putting the family at risk. Otis explains that he must speak up for the right of men to be secure in the privacy of their homes. Otis worries that, no matter how persuasive he may be, Judge Hutchinson will not listen. Adams expects Otis to lose and opines that war will ultimately be needed. Otis still hopes the dispute can be settled through the courts. Otis rehearses the speech for his daughter, Mary. The rehearsal fades out, and Otis is delivering his speech before Judge Hutchinson. Otis argues that the writs annihilate the sacred human right of a man to be secure in his house. He argues that a man is sovereign in his own house and that his rights there are inalienable. And if upheld, Otis urges that the people will resist. In a gathering of Otis's wife and daughter following the speech, Mary defends her father. Otis's wife and their older daughter feel ashamed that Otis has disgraced the family. The Governor meets with Robinson and asks Robinson to show Otis and the other trouble-makers the error of their ways. Sam Adams informs Otis that his speech is being printed and distributed throughout the colonies where its message will be like a lightning bolt. After hearing the speech in court, John Adams is introduced to Otis and congratulates him for the speech. Robinson enters the pub and confronts Otis. One of Robinson's men hits Otis in the head with a club. Otis sustains a brain injury, and the doctor tells the family that he will require constant care for a long time. ===Part 3=== Years have passed, and Otis's sister, now a spy for the patriots, visits Otis's home. She is told that Otis's mind is almost completely gone. He came out from the shadows briefly but the shadows have returned. The Battle of Bunker Hill is fought. Otis hears the battle and is pleased that the people are resisting. He insists he is not too sick to join the fight. He joins the patriots in the battle. Otis returns home after the battle. He describes the battle as "a fine beginning, a fine first page".

23013668	A Bone for a Bone	A Bone for a Bone is a 1951 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes short directed by Friz Freleng. It was released on April 7, 1951, and features the Goofy Gophers. The cartoon is the first of four Goofy Gophers cartoon directed by Freleng, and would be the final work by J.B. Hardaway at the Warner Bros. Cartoons studio, having returned after almost a decade at Walter Lantz Productions. ==Plot== The Gophers are playing a gin game in their hole in the ground outside a house, where Tosh loses his fifth game in a row, when Geo P. Dog digs a hole and dumps a bone on the Gophers and then dirt as he fills the hole in. Geo does remove the bone upon Tosh's request, but realizing that it was gophers who asked him to move the bone, he returns to the same hole to rebury the bone. This time, Mac goes up, only to be grabbed by Geo. Mac then yells for help, which arrives in the form of Tosh and a hammer, which Tosh uses to knock Geo's head into his collar, allowing the Gophers to return to their hole and escape the dog, but not before the Gophers have an argument over who should enter the hole first. As Geo then reaches into the hole to try to find the Gophers, the Gophers attach a fake hand to one end of a gray garden hose and a noose around the other end to fasten to the dog's actual hand. The hose is then brought out of another hole and extended out to the street, where it is quickly run over by a truck, leading the dog to believe he has been hurt until he finds Tosh behind him. After blocking two attempts by Tosh to get back into his hole, the dog challenges Tosh to come up with a trick, which he does: a card with firecracker that explodes, allowing Tosh to escape. Furious, Geo then gets a can of TNT and pours it down the Gophers' hole. Mac then emerges from the other one and asks to borrow a match, to which Geo obliges, only to see the match used to light the pouring TNT and ignite it. Finally, Geo chases the Gophers underground, and is tricked into believing they went into an open gas main. Soon after Geo enters the main, the Gophers close it making it pitch black. As the dog attempts to light a match, the gas main explodes, and the dog pops out of the oven in the house and eventually departs the premises (it is here that the dog is identified). The Gophers then resume their gin game. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1951 animated films Category:1951 short films Category:1951 films Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:Warner Bros.

52178053	A Boogie wit da Hoodie	Artist Julius Dubose (born December 6, 1995), known professionally as A Boogie wit da Hoodie (or simply A Boogie), is an American rapper and singer. He is signed to Atlantic Records, as well as his own label imprint, Highbridge the Label. His stage name is derived from the character "Ace Boogie" from the 2002 film Paid in Full, and because he was wearing hoodies all the time, friends gave him the nickname "A Boogie wit da Hoodie". His highest-charting singles are "Numbers" (which debuted at number 23 on the Billboard Hot 100), "Look Back at It" (number 27), and "Drowning" (number 38). His debut studio album, The Bigger Artist (2017), debuted at number four on the Billboard 200 chart. He released his second studio album, Hoodie SZN (2018), which became his first number one album on the Billboard 200. His third studio album, Artist 2.0 (2020), debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. He released his fourth studio album, Me vs. Myself on December 9, 2022. ==Early life and education== Artist Julius Dubose was born on December 6, 1995, in the Highbridge neighborhood of the Bronx in New York City. Dubose was raised in Highbridge and began rapping at age twelve after listening to Kanye West and 50 Cent. He attended Dewitt Clinton High School, where he expanded upon rapping during his freshman year, engaging in cyphers at lunchtime by performing rhymes he had already written and stored in a large notebook he carried with him. Remarking on his time in high school to XXL, he said "I was regular, everybody really noticed me. I was the one in the back of the classroom, quiet." Growing up, Dubose frequently got into legal trouble, mainly for selling cannabis and narcotics. After finding out what he was doing, Dubose's parents sent him to Florida as punishment. He attended Fort Pierce Central in Fort Pierce, Florida. In Florida, Dubose was kept under house arrest. During this confinement, he began to work on his artistry, starting off by tweaking his self-composed rhymes and gradually leading one thing to another. He even built an amateur studio inside the apartment that he lived in. Following his high school graduation, Dubose continued to focus on his music while working jobs in different, sectors including construction and pizza delivery. ==Career== ===2015–2016: Career beginnings=== Dubose's official discography began with the single "Temporary", which he released on SoundCloud. He was just nineteen at the time of its release. The song lacked good rhythm and flow, which is usually required for a good hip-hop number. Myster Whyte, who he met in Florida and produced the song, showed A Boogie the inside of his first professional studio. He asked A Boogie to work with a trainer until he got his techniques right. Dubose's said, "I used to record songs like, play the beat from one phone and have another phone recording me and just rap. Moving from that to a studio was like, 'Damn, I never knew I could sound like this'. It was just magic". The training sessions with Myster helped progress his sound. In 2015, Dubose moved back to New York in an attempt to start making hip hop his full-time career. He, Don Q, Quincy "QP" Acheampong, and Bubba then created Highbridge the Label and set up a home studio. A Boogie released his first full-length project, a mixtape titled Artist, in February 2016, which launched his career and was on Forbes list of up-and-coming rappers. The mixtape was recorded during a time where Dubose was dealing with a difficult break-up which helped influence the mixtape and Dubose's future sound all together. Dubose then released a collaborative project, alongside fellow Highbridge-based rapper Don Q, titled Highbridge the Label: The Takeover Vol.1, on May 18, 2016. Dubose went on to have three opening dates on Drake and Future's Summer Sixteen Tour. Dubose was also co-signed by Drake. In July 2016, A Boogie signed a deal with Atlantic Records. In September 2016, he was featured on the BET Hip Hop Awards cypher alongside Don Q, Russ, Kent Jones and Nick Grant. Later in October 2016, A Boogie released his first extended play (EP), titled TBA, in acronym for "The Bigger Artist". The EP peaked at number 63 on the US Billboard 200 chart and appeared on Rolling Stone magazine's 40 Best Rap Albums of 2016 list. ===2017–2018: The Bigger Artist and Hoodie SZN=== thumb|A Boogie wit da Hoodie performing in 2017 On June 13, 2017, Dubose was named as one of the ten of XXLs "2017 Freshman Class".

In January 2021, Dubose was sued by a Bergen County, New Jersey, couple, who claimed that he clogged the toilets and caused $260,000 in damages in their mansion, which they had leased to him in 2017 and 2018. Dubose was arrested a day after celebrating his 25th birthday in December 2020.

BCPO detectives were accompanied by detectives from the New York City Police Department and officers from the Demarest Police Department. While doing a search of Dubose's home, law enforcement seized four guns: "a Ruger .380 handgun, a Glock .40 caliber handgun, an H&K; 9mm handgun and a Smith & Wesson 9mm handgun." They also discovered "hollow point bullets, various high capacity magazines" as well as "marijuana, hashish oil edibles and drug paraphernalia commonly associated with the distribution of controlled dangerous substances." Dubose's security guard, 33-year-old Quashaun Hagler, was also arrested. Hagler, who is a Georgia resident, appears to have been at A Boogie's home at the time of the search and arrest. Hagler was charged with three counts of unlawful possession of a handgun (a 2nd-degree felony) and one count of possession of a large capacity magazine (a 4th-degree felony). Dubose was arrested at London's Wireless Festival in September 2021 by the Metropolitan Police, by request of the Greater Manchester Police.

13160033	A Book Like This	A Book Like This is the first studio album by Australian singer-songwriter duo Angus & Julia Stone. It was released in September 2007 in Australia and debuted and peaked on the ARIA Charts at number 6. The album was released in the UK through Flock Music/PIAS on 31 March 2008 and an alternative version was released in North America through Nettwerk on 3 March 2009 where the band performed songs from the album on US Radio Station KCRW . At the ARIA Music Awards of 2008, the album was nominated for Best Blues and Roots Album, Best Group, Breakthrough Artist and Best Cover Art. ==Reception== Andrew Leahey from AllMusic said "Angus & Julia Stone's debut recalls the lush, cuddle-up- in-bed indie folk of the Weepies and Kaiser Cartel. A Book Like This takes strength from its two young songwriters, both of whom approach love and coming-of-age issues from their own gendered perspective. Julia plays the part of the quirky ingénue, her vocals fluttering like a young Joanna Newsom over homespun melodies and gauzy instrumental backdrops... where brother Angus details an awkward encounter with the fairer sex". Leahey concluded "A Book Like This is an appropriate soundtrack for lazy Sunday afternoons and slow Monday mornings, when the pace of the world matches the relaxed gait of this band." ==Track listing== ===Alternative version (2009)=== ==Personnel== * Zach Brock– Strings, Violin * Ian Burdge– Cello * Mitchell Connelly– Drums, Percussion * Calina de la Mare– Violin * Emery Dobyns– Harmony * Ali Friend– Bass * Fran Healy– Bass, Congas, Glockenspiel, Piano * Sally Herbert– String Arrangements, Strings, Violin * Christopher Hoffman– Cello, Strings * John Metcalfe– Viola * Elizabeth Myers– Strings, Viola * Ian Pritchett– Bass * Jeff Ratner– Bass, Double Bass * Angus Stone– Guitar, Guitar (Electric), Harmonica, Vocals * Julia Stone– Bazouki, Guitar, Organ, Piano, Trumpet, Vocals * Cameron Whipp– Violin * Sarah Jane Wilson– Cello * Producers– Angus & Julia Stone, Fran Healy, Ian Pritchett * Mixer– Ian Pritchett * Album Illustrator– Caroline Pedler ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (2007–2010) Peak position US Heatseekers Albums (Billboard) 32 ===Year-end charts=== Chart (2007) Position Australian Artist Albums Chart 47 Chart (2008) Position Australian Albums Chart 60 Australian Artist Albums Chart 14 Chart (2010) Position Australian Artist Albums Chart 47 ==Certification== ==Release history== Country Date Format Label Catalogue Australia 8 September 2007 CD Capitol Records/EMI Music 5056592 Europe 8 September 2007 CD Discograph 3233062 United Kingdom 31 March 2008 CD/DVD, Digital download Flock/PIAS FLOCKCD1ST USA & Canada 2009 CD/DVD, Digital download Nettwerk 067003082525 ==References== Category:2007 albums Category:Angus & Julia Stone albums Category:EMI Records albums Category:Independiente Records albums
2566414	A Book from the Sky	A Book from the Sky () is the title of a book produced by Chinese artist Xu Bing in the style of fine editions from the Song and Ming dynasties, but filled entirely with meaningless glyphs designed to resemble traditional Chinese characters.Two of the characters were later found by Charles Stone to coincide with attested Chinese characters; however, one of these was itself a 9th-century forgery The book, which consists of four volumes totaling 604 pages, was printed in a single print run of 126 copies between 1987 and 1991, and was first publicly exhibited in October 1988, in Beijing's China Art Gallery. The work was originally titled Mirror to Analyze the World: The Century’s Final Volume (), a title which "evokes the trope of the book as jian 鍳 or mirror in the venerable tradition of imperial historiography". However, the artist eventually felt that this title was "cumbersome" and "heavily influenced by Western forms and the current cultural climate", and decided to adopt the name that was already in popular use, Tianshu. In Chinese, the term tian shu (“divine writing”) originally referred to certain kinds of religious texts, but is now used to mean "gibberish"; it has thus been suggested that nonsense writing would be a more appropriate translation of the title. ==Production== The book is composed using a set of 4,000 characters, as this is roughly the number of characters in common usage in modern written Chinese. These characters were designed on the basis of the Kangxi radicals, so that "in terms of density of strokes and frequency of occurrence, they... appear, on the page, to be real characters". In addition to these, page and fascicle numbers were indicated using tally marks based on the Chinese character 正. The characters were carved into individual pieces of movable type made from pear wood, in a style slightly squatter than that of Song typefaces. Initially, Xu himself typeset sample pages, and took them for printing to a factory in the village of Hanying (), in Caiyu township (). (This was one of the last remaining traditional printing factories in China, which after the Cultural Revolution mainly produced state-sponsored reprints of classical texts using pre-Revolution woodblocks.) Later, workers at the factory typeset the pages by referring to a "model book" prepared by Xu, which contained symbols such as ↓★○☒❖ that had been placed in a one-to-one correspondence with his 4,000 pseudo-Chinese characters. ==Reactions== Critical reactions to A Book from the Sky were initially dismissive. In 1990, an article in a Beijing newspaper, said to have been authored by an agent of the Ministry of Culture, described it as “ghosts building walls” (), i.e., obfuscation for the sake of obfuscation. Meanwhile, “New Wave” artists found it too “traditional and academic”. Nevertheless, the 1988 exhibition of the book at the China Art Gallery attracted a broad audience that included not only artists, but also professors and editors, some of whom visited the exhibition repeatedly in an attempt to find even a single real Chinese character. Later critics viewed the work more positively. A Book from the Sky is considered to be a representative of the “1985 Fine Arts New Wave” (), and has been interpreted as “a primary symbol of the broad liberalization movement that characterized the years prior to the Tiananmen massacre”. It has also invited comparisons with James Joyce’s Finnegans Wake, as “a radical challenge to how we think about language, writing, literacy, and human-machine relationship”. However, according to Xu, his main purpose was to “expose the fact that Chinese literary culture is 討厭 taoyan”: ‘boring’ or ‘tedious’. In later works such as Square Word Calligraphy and Book from the Ground, he takes this idea further by subverting the logographic nature of the Chinese script in ways that make it broadly accessible. ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== *Description on Xu Bing’s website *Blog post mentioning A Book from the Sky, with photographs Category:Art exhibitions in China Category:1988 books Category:Chinese characters Category:Artists' books
57279816	A Book of American Martyrs	A Book of American Martyrs is a 2017 novel by the American author, Joyce Carol Oates. The story chronicles two American families, the Voorheeses and the Dunphys, whose faith and convictions are vastly different. The story begins with the aftermath of the November 1999 murder of Dr. Gus Voorhees by Luther Amos Dunphy. Broadly, Oates' story explores the abortion debate in the United States, with a primary focus on exploring the growing divide and conflict between advocates and opponents of legal abortion care services, as well as anti-abortion violence. \- \- The story is set in a small town in Ohio where the Dunphy family lives and throughout Michigan where the Voorhees family lives. == Reception == The review aggregator website, Book Marks, reported that overall the novel received positive feedback. Erica Wagner of The Guardian noted that the novel does not live up to its potential, writing, "This is a gripping novel, full of unexpected twists that make what could be a political treatise into a page- turner. And it is as honest as its author can make it, or so the reader must believe; but that’s an honesty that only goes so far." Writing for The New York Times, Ayana Mathis describes how "The shifting kaleidoscope of voices is at once illuminating and dizzying. Oates may be betting the multitude of perspectives will help us see around our blinders and prejudices about the Other. The question is, who is the Other, and according to whom? In some respects, Oates’s bet pays off." However, Mathis continues, "There is a great deal of smugness in all of this, and worse, a dangerous paternalism. The Other, in this case, the white working poor, with all of its religion and pathologies, has been summarily dismissed as an ignorant horde in need of (liberal) guidance. Oates’s lengthy attempt at insights into these lives devolves into dehumanizing caricature." The Washington Post's Ron Charles praises the novel, concluding that, "To enter this masterpiece is to be captivated by the paradox of that tragic courage and to become invested in Oates’s search for some semblance of atonement, secular or divine. Regardless of your own faith or politics, the real miracle here is how, even after 700 pages, we can still be racing along, steeling ourselves for the very last line, a line we’re desperate to reach — but not too soon." Paste magazine's Bridey Heing commends Oates' ability to navigate both sides of a deeply polarizing topic, noting how, "Ultimately, Oates does not moralize, and this isn’t a book that will comfort those who are strong in their beliefs. But in that lies the book’s value. At a time when we as a society feel so ideologically distant and yet are told that we have more in common than all that divides us, this novel rings true without being weighed down by sentimentality." ==References== Category:2017 American novels Category:Novels by Joyce Carol Oates Category:Novels about abortion Category:Gun violence in popular culture Category:Ecco Press books

In 1983 Didion published Salvador, a book of essays on corruption and violence in El Salvador; the fiction and non-fiction reflect a similar perspective of rage and despair. ==Plot introduction== The novel is narrated by Grace Strasser-Mendana, an American expatriate who married into one of the three or four families that dominate Boca Grande politics, the Mendanas. Grace was trained as an anthropologist under Claude Lévi-Strauss, and later took up the amateur study of biochemistry, both attempts to find clear-cut, scientific answers to the mysteries of human behavior. Both attempts fail: Grace remains uncomprehending and cut off from the people around her, and in the final line of the novel she admits, "I have not been the witness I wanted to be." But Grace is not the novel's central character. That is Charlotte Douglas, another American woman sojourning in Boca Grande, although her family ties are elsewhere. Charlotte's beloved daughter Marin has run off with a group of Marxist radicals and taken part in an absurd act of terrorism, and in the wake of her daughter's disappearance, Charlotte's marriage to a crusading Berkeley lawyer (not Marin's father), has fallen apart. ==References== == External links == * Book page on Joan Didion website Category:1977 American novels Category:Novels by Joan Didion Category:Novels set in Central America
6759357	A Book of Giants	A Book of Giants is a 1963 anthology of 13 fairy tales from Europe that have been collected and retold by Ruth Manning-Sanders. It is one in a long series of such anthologies by Manning-Sanders. It was the first anthology to receive the familiar "A Book of..." title that Manning-Sanders would become notable for. This book was first published in the United Kingdom in 1962, by Methuen & Co. Ltd. It has been used in schools as a study aid. Some of the tales from this book are also included in A Choice of Magic (1971) by Manning-Sanders. And some of the tales from this book are included in Folk and Fairy Tales (1978) by Manning-Sanders. And in the foreword, Manning-Sanders discusses the long-ago roots of tales about giants: "The stories in this book are very old, and they come from many countries. We don't know who first told the story of Jack and the Beanstalk; but it has always been a favourite, and it used to be hawked around England in those little stitched-together pamphlets, called chapbooks, which travelling pedlars sold to the countryfolk for a penny or two each." The author adds: "You will notice that the giants, wherever they come from, have one thing in common: they are all very stupid, and the way to overcome them is to use your wits." ==Table of contents== *1. Jack and the Beanstalk (England) *2. The Giant and the Dwarf (Georgia) *3. Fin M'Coul and Cucullin (Ireland) *4. Sneezy Snatcher and Sammy Small (Cornwall) *5.

Prince Loaf (Romania) ==Reception== Kirkus Reviews gave A Book of Giants a kirkus star and wrote "Miss Manning-Sanders narrates these old legends in a direct language..." and "In his fine-lined drawings, Robin Jacques has built up a good contrast between the large and the small and has captured the essence of giantdom with a light touch." The Observer found "A splendid jacket by Robin Jacques at once invites the eye. Of course, myths have almost always been unfair to giants: still, we could not separate them from nursery lore, especially when, as in several of these tales, they are merely kindly, stupid fellows, easily outwitted (but not slain) by some sharp little dwarf. Though some are from local sources, others are from as far afield as Russian Georgia or Jutland. But are they so different?" ==See also== *Giant (mythology) ==References== Category:1962 short story collections Category:1962 children's books Category:Collections of fairy tales Category:Children's short story collections Category:British children's books Category:British short story collections Category:European fairy tales Category:Fiction about giants Category:1962 anthologies

46442290	A Book of Mediterranean Food	A Book of Mediterranean Food was an influential cookery book written by Elizabeth David in 1950, her first, and published by John Lehmann. After years of rationing and wartime austerity, the book brought light and colour back to English cooking, with simple fresh ingredients, from David's experience of Mediterranean cooking while living in France, Italy and Greece. The book was illustrated by John Minton, and the chapters were introduced with quotations from famous writers. At the time, many ingredients were scarcely obtainable, but the book was quickly recognised as serious, and within a few years it profoundly changed English cooking and eating habits. ==Context== Returning to postwar England, still with food rationing, after years living in the Mediterranean with its wealth of fresh ingredients, Elizabeth David found life grey and daunting. The food was terrible: "There was flour and water soup seasoned solely with pepper; bread and gristle rissoles; dehydrated onions and carrots; corned beef toad in the hole. I need not go on." ==Book== Partly to earn some money, and partly from an "agonized craving for the sun", David began writing articles on Mediterranean cookery. Her first efforts were published in 1949 in the British edition of Harper's Bazaar. From the outset, David refused to sell the copyright of her articles, and so she was able to collect and edit them for publication in book form. Even before all the articles had been published, she had assembled them into a typescript volume and submitted it to a series of publishers, all of whom turned it down. One of them explained that a collection of unconnected recipes needed linking text. David took this advice, but, conscious of her inexperience as a writer, she kept her own prose short and quoted extensively from established authors whose views on the Mediterranean might carry more weight. In the published volume, the sections are linked by substantial extracts from works by writers including Norman Douglas, Lawrence Durrell, Gertrude Stein, D. H. Lawrence, Osbert Sitwell, Compton Mackenzie, Arnold Bennett, Henry James and Théophile Gautier. She submitted the revised typescript to John Lehmann, a publisher more associated with poetry than cookery, but he accepted it, agreeing to an advance payment of £100. A Book of Mediterranean Food was published in 1950. Lehmann had suggested it be named "The Blue Train Cookery Book", since he supposed that the romance of Mediterranean countries was to be found in the exciting train journeys to reach them. The book appeared when food rationing imposed during the Second World War remained fully in force in Britain. As David later put it, "almost every essential ingredient of good cooking was either rationed or unobtainable." She therefore adapted some of the recipes she had learned during the years when she lived in Mediterranean countries, "to make up for lack of flavour which should have been supplied by meat or stock or butter." ===Lyricism=== The historian of food Panikos Panayi argues that with A Book of Mediterranean Food, David profoundly changed English cooking. He considers the opening section to contain "perhaps the most evocative and inspirational passage in the history of British cookery writing": David then describes the region and its perfumes: ===Illustrations=== Lehmann commissioned a coloured dust-jacket painting and black and white internal illustrations from his friend the artist John Minton. Writers including Cyril Ray and John Arlott commented that Minton's drawings added to the attractions of the book."Cookery", The Times Literary Supplement, 9 June 1950, p. 362; Arlott, John. "From Time to Time", The Guardian, 18 July 1986, p. 15; and "First Bites", The Guardian, 15 March 1994, p. B5 David, a woman of strong opinions, thought good illustration important. Minton provided 15 decorations to give a feeling of the Mediterranean, rather than simple illustrations of dishes from David's recipes. For example, his port scene shows a sailor drinking and conversing with a young woman beside a table laden with food; in the background is a street restaurant and boats in a harbour. Although David did not like Minton's black and white drawings, she described his jacket design as "stunning". She was especially taken with "his beautiful Mediterranean bay, his tables spread with white cloths and bright fruit" and the way that "pitchers and jugs and bottles of wine could be seen far down the street." ===Contents=== The chapters cover in turn: soups; eggs and luncheon dishes; fish; meat; substantial dishes; poultry and game; vegetables; cold food and salads; sweets; jams, chutneys and preserves; and sauces. The soup chapter sets the pattern for the book, with short, simple recipes, such as soup of haricot beans – two brief paragraphs – interspersed with long, complex ones like that for Mediterranean fish soup, which covers three pages. The eggs and luncheon dish section likewise balances the concise and simple such as ratatouille aux oeufs against the detailed and discursive three-page consideration of omelettes. Unlike many writers of cookery books, David rarely gives precise quantities or timings: in the fish chapter her suggestion for fresh tuna is: The meat section begins with recipes for veal, generally unfamiliar at English tables in 1950. David also gives recipes for kid and boar. Mutton, by contrast, was more often served then than in more recent decades, and David gives four recipes for it, one of them disguising the flavour to taste like venison by long marinating and highly seasoned saucing. The "substantial dishes" chapter discusses and illustrates the merits of risotto and paella, and deals with polenta and spaghetti – both less familiar in Britain then than now – and goes on to describe cassoulet. The next chapter, on poultry and game, begins with recipes for cooking chicken and duck, and goes on to partridge – both à la provençale and in Greek style – quail and pigeons, concluding with snipe cooked en papillote with mushrooms. The Mediterranean theme of the book is emphasised in the section on vegetables, in which there are five aubergine recipes and only one potato dish (pommes Anna). Dishes from Greece and North Africa are included along with typical southern French standards such as tomates provençales. The occasional non-Mediterranean dish is included, including cèpes à la bordelaise (fried in olive oil with parsley and garlic). The cold food and salads chapter gives instructions for three dishes of cold chicken, several traditional pâtés and terrines, and another non-Mediterranean recipe, the traditional Easter dish from Burgundy, jambon persillé de Bourgogne. David adds to this section suggestions for hors d'oeuvres, including Greek dishes then unfamiliar in Britain including dolmádes and taramá, as well as traditional French recipes such as sardines marinées à la niçoise. In the section on sweets, David comments that throughout the Mediterranean countries, the more complicated sweets are very often bought from pâtisseries; the few recipes she gives are for simple, traditional sweets made at home, such as torrijas (also called pain perdu) and cold orange soufflé. The jams, chutneys and preserves section includes preserved melon alongside more familiar fruits such as pears and plums. In the final chapter, on sauces, David includes classics like béchamel, béarnaise, hollandaise and mayonnaise (which, she advises, "stir steadily but not like a maniac"). To these she adds Turkish, Greek, Italian and Egyptian sauces, the majority of them intended to go with Mediterranean fish dishes. ==Reception== ===Contemporary=== The Times Literary Supplement observed in 1950 that "while one might hesitate to attempt 'Lobster à la Enfant Prodigue' (with champagne, garlic, basil, lemon, chervil, mushrooms and truffles), the resourceful cook with time to explore London's more individual shops, and money, should not often be nonplussed.""Cookery", The Times Literary Supplement, 9 June 1950, p. 365 The Observer commented, also in 1950, that the book deserved "to become the familiar companion of all who seek uninhibited excitement in the kitchen." ===Modern=== The celebrity cook Clarissa Dickson Wright comments that the book was "a breath of fresh air in the years of austerity that followed the Second World War, and [David's] espousal of excellent, well-prepared ingredients has become the hallmark of English food at its best." At that time "food was dull, vegetables were [thoroughly] stewed and olive oil was something you bought at the chemist and was marked 'for external use only'." David, on the other hand, "evoked a world of sunshine and lavender, of bougainvillea and cannas, and of fresh and simple food beautifully prepared." Rachel Cooke, writing in The Guardian, quotes the chef Simon Hopkinson, who knew David in the 1980s, as believing that David's "powerful effect .. on British palates .. was as much a question of timing as anything else". She "arrived on the scene at just the right moment: the British middle classes, exhausted by austerity, were longing, even if they did not precisely know it, for the taste of sunshine." Caroline Stacey, writing in The Independent, calls the book "her hymn of longing to the cooking around the southern shores", noting that it "changed what the British middle classes ate", and that she "ushered not only olive oil and garlic, but also aubergines, courgettes and basil on to the stripped-pine tables of 1960s kitchens." Melanie McDonagh, writing in The Telegraph, states that with A Book of Mediterranean Food, David "introduced the Brits to the cooking of Greece, Italy and Provence in 1950 after her return from Greece, via Egypt and India". She comments that the cookery writer Jane Grigson, a "devotee", said "Basil was no more than the name of bachelor uncles, courgette was printed in italics as an alien word, and few of us knew how to eat spaghetti ... Then came Elizabeth David, like sunshine." McDonagh adds that David "was one of the first and much the classiest of the personality food writers, even though she was never a telly chef: paving the way for Jamie, Nigella, Nigel and Hugh F-W." Dissenting from the general acclaim, Tom Norrington-Davies, also writing in The Telegraph, argues that the book "reached only a very small section of the population", but at once qualifies this, stating that these readers were "undergoing a dramatic upheaval. Educated, moderately wealthy women suddenly found themselves in their kitchens without servants". He cites Jane Grigson's observation, introducing a collection of David's writing, that "Elizabeth didn't so much restore [middle-class women's] confidence in cooking as invent it". Joe Moran, writing in the Financial Times, describes the genesis of the book as a "defining moment". It was when, "stranded by a blizzard" in a hotel in Ross-on-Wye whose restaurant served meals so dismal that they seemed to her to be "produced with a kind of bleak triumph which amounted almost to a hatred of humanity and humanity’s needs", David felt her famous "agonised craving for the sun". Furious at the joyless food, she started to draft the "sensuous descriptions" of Mediterranean food that led to A Book of Mediterranean Food. Marian Burros, writing in The New York Times, comments that David first showed "her importance" with the book. "The ration-weary English could barely buy enough to eat but they were enchanted by her descriptions of meals that included eggs, butter, seafood, tomatoes, olives, apricots, ingredients that were difficult, or impossible, to obtain. Foods that are taken for granted today in England – garlic, olive oil, Parmigiano Reggiano – were unknown and generally viewed with suspicion before Mrs. David." ==Editions== The book has appeared in the following editions since 1950, including translations into Danish and Chinese. * London: Lehmann, 1950 (1st ed.) * Harmondsworth : Penguin, 1950 (paperback) * London: Lehmann, 1951 * New York City: Horizon, 1952 * Harmondsworth, New York : Penguin, 1955 * Harmondsworth : Penguin, 1956 * London: Macdonald, 1958 (2nd ed.) * London: Cookery Book Club, 1958 * Baltimore: Penguin, 1958 * Baltimore: Penguin, 1960 * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1960 * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1965 * Harmondsworth, Baltimore : Penguin, 1966 * London: Cookery Book Club, 1968 * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1971 * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1975 * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1977 * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1983 * Copenhagen: Hans Reitzel/Gyldendals Bogklub, 1984 * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1987 * London: Dorling Kindersley, 1988 (illus., rev.) * Sydney: Collins, 1988 * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1989 (2nd ed.) * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1991 (new intro.) * Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1998 * New York: New York Review Books, 2002 * China: 麥田出版 / Tai Bei Shi, 2006 (地中海風味料理 / Di zhong hai feng wei liao li, by 大衛 David, Elizabeth with Da Wei; Fang-tian Huang * London: Folio Society, 2009 (intro. by Julian Barnes, colour illus. by Sophie MacCarthy) ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * Category:1950 non-fiction books Category:English cuisine Category:British cookbooks Category:Mediterranean cuisine
33623489	A Book of Memories	A Book of Memories () is a 1986 novel by the Hungarian writer Péter Nádas. The narrative follows a Hungarian novelist involved in a romantic triangle in East Berlin; interwoven with the main story are sections of a novel the main character is writing, about a German novelist at the turn of the century. An English translation by Ivan Sanders and Imre Goldstein was published in 1997 through Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The novel won the French Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger in 1998. ==Reception== Under the headline "The Soul of Proust Under Socialism", Eva Hoffman reviewed the book for The New York Times. She wrote that "in A Book of Memories, Peter Nadas ... has accomplished a remarkably interesting feat: he has transposed the novel of consciousness to the Socialist universe, and closed the gap between prewar modernism (inflected here by post-modern psychoanalysis) and Eastern Europe." Hoffman wrote that the novel has a style of details in "magnified, hot close-up", and that "Longueurs can have their plaisirs, as we know from Proust; but some passages in A Book of Memories are drawn out to the point of tedium or silliness, and the novel within the novel is marred by occasional affectation. Still, these are minor flaws in a work that offers a lot of incidental as well as major pleasures: quirky chapter titles, in the manner of Robert Musil ("A Telegram Arrives" and "Slowly the Pain Returned"); an astonishing scene in which two boys help a sow deliver her litter; a rare honesty about the conflicts of homosexual romance; and the colloquial freshness of the language." The American literary theorist Susan Sontag called A Book of Memories "the greatest novel written in our time, and one of the great books of the century." ==See also== * 1986 in literature * Hungarian literature ==References== Category:1986 novels Category:Hungarian novels Category:Novels by Péter Nádas

1253619	A Book of Prefaces	A Book of Prefaces is H. L. Mencken's 1917 collection of essays criticizing American culture, authors, and movements. Mencken described the work as "[My] most important book in its effects upon my professional career." In fact, the book was considered vitriolic enough that Mencken's close friend Alfred Knopf was concerned about publishing it because of the massive increase in patriotism during World War I in America. The book was eighty pages long and divided into four essays. The first three were concerned with specific writers: Theodore Dreiser, Joseph Conrad and James Gibbons Huneker, respectively. But perhaps the most important, and certainly the most outspoken essay was entitled "Puritanism as a Literary Force," during which he alleged that William Dean Howells, Henry James, and Mark Twain were victims of the Puritan spirit. :"The Puritan's utter lack of aesthetic sense, his distrust of all romantic emotion, his unmatchable intolerance of opposition, his unbreakable belief in his own bleak and narrow views, his savage cruelty of attack, his lust for relentless and barbarous persecution – these things have put an almost unbearable burden up on the exchange of ideas in the United States." Mencken had criticized Puritanism for many years, famously characterizing it as "the haunting fear that someone, somewhere, may be happy," but through World War I his criticism became increasingly outspoken, in part due to the rising tide of Prohibition. Mencken's book triggered the imagination of a famous American author. As a teen first entering the world of reading and books in the early 1920s, Richard Wright found literary inspiration in A Book of Prefaces. ==Response== ===Critical response=== Response to Mencken's book was generally poor, but certain defenders of American culture were particularly outspoken in their criticism of the book—most notably Stuart Sherman, a professor at the University of Illinois (Sherman was personally attacked in Prefaces). According to Sherman: "[Mencken] leaps from the saddle with sabre flashing, stables his horse in the church, shoots the priest, hangs three professors, exiles the Academy, burns the library and the university, and amid smoking ashes, erects a new school of criticism on modern German principles." Other major critics included Paul Elmer More and Irving Babbitt, although neither of these was as vitriolic as Sherman. ===Mencken's response=== According to Mencken, Sherman's review was "a masterly exposure of what is going on in the Puritan mind, and particularly of its maniacal fear of the German." "The curse of criticism in America is the infernal babbling of third-rate college professor... [the Book of Prefaces] shook the professors as they had never been shaken before." ==Sources== * Bode, Carl Mencken. Southern Illinois University Press, London, 1969. * Hobson, Fred Mencken.

71478678	A Book of Ryhmes	A Book of is a miniature book of poems by Charlotte Brontë. It was written in 1829 when Brontë was aged 13. The book is part of the collections of the Brontë Parsonage Museum in Haworth, West Yorkshire. A Book of (the word rhymes is misspelt) is one of six miniature books written by the teenage Brontë, forming part of her juvenilia. Dated 17 December 1829, it measures only 3.8 in × 2.5 in (9.7 cm × 6.4 cm). The book sold for $520 in an auction at Walpole Galleries in New York City in 1916 (). The last of Brontë's miniature books to be owned by a private collector, its location was subsequently unknown until April 2022 when it was announced that it would be for sale at the New York International Antiquarian Book Fair later that month. It sold for $1.25 million (£983,500), making it possibly the most expensive book ever sold, in terms of price per unit of surface area. The book was purchased by a British literary charity, the Friends of the National Libraries, which donated it to the Brontë Parsonage Museum. The estate of T. S. Eliot and the Garfield Weston Foundation donated funds to the Friends of the National Libraries to assist in buying the book. The principal curator of the Brontë Parsonage Museum, Ann Dinsdale, said that it was "...always emotional when an item belonging to the Brontë family is returned home and this final little book, coming back to the place it was written when it had been thought lost, is very special for us." At the time that it acquired A Book of , the museum already had nine other miniature books made by the Brontë siblings, and expected to receive seven more from the Honresfield Library in the near future. ==Contents== The Book of has 15 pages with handstitched brown paper covers. It contains 10 poems. The title page is inscribed ". Sold by Nobody. And printed by Herself". ===List of poems=== The contents of the book were listed by Brontë in her 1830 list of her work to date. The text of the poems was unknown until the 2022 rediscovery of the book, having never been transcribed or summarised. # "The Beauty of Nature" # "A Short Poem" # "Meditations while Journeying in a Canadian Forest" # "Song of an Exile" # "On Seeing the Ruins of the Tower of Babel" # "A Thing of 14 Lines" # "Lines written on the Bank of a River one fine Summer Evening" # "Spring, a Song" # "Autumn, a Song" ==See also== *Glass Town *The Young Men's Magazine * List of most expensive books and manuscripts ==References== ==External links== *AnneBronte.Org - A Book of is found Category:1829 books Category:Works by Charlotte Brontë Category:1829 poems Category:English poetry collections

19959644	A Book on Angling	A Book on Angling – Being a complete treatise on the art of angling in every branch is a work of angling literature with significant fly fishing content written by Francis Francis, angling editor to The Field and published in London in 1867 by Longmans, Green and Company. ==Synopsis== A Book on Angling is best described by the author himself in the preface to the first edition: > When first infected with the fever of Angling, more years ago than I care to > count up, my ambition was to catch every species of freshwater fish, from > the minnow up to the salmon, which inhabits our British waters.

64879264	A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on the Other Spirits	A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on the Other Spirits () is a treatise by the Swiss lay theologian and philosopher Paracelsus, published posthumously in 1566. It is about elemental beings and their place in a Christian cosmology. ==Background== A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on the Other Spirits was written by Paracelsus (1493/1494 – 1541) late in his life, but it is not known what exact year it is from. The descriptions of elemental beings are based on various ancient and traditional sources, which the author adapted and reinterpreted. ==Summary== Paracelsus argues from his reading of the Biblical creation narrative that man needs to use philosophy to gain knowledge about the natural world, or he will not be able to understand Christ and appreciate the Bible. The natural world contains many strange things, including elemental beings corresponding to the four classical elements: nymphs (water), sylphs (air), pygmies (earth) and salamanders (fire). He dismisses the conventional Christian view that elemental beings are devils, instead arguing that they are significant parts of God's creation, and studies them like he studied the rest of the natural world. ==Publication== Like Paracelsus' other theological works, A Book on Nymphs was published posthumously, first appearing as a separate print in 1566 and the year after in a collection of the author's philosophical writings. After that it has appeared in a number of collections of Paracelsus' works. An English translation by Henry E. Sigherist appears in Four Treatises of Theophrastus von Hohenheim Called Paracelsus, published by Johns Hopkins University Press in 1941 and republished in 1996. ==Legacy== The fairy-tale like quality of the treatise has made it a popular source of inspiration for poets and fiction writers. It was the main source for the descriptions of elementals in the 1670 work Comte de Gabalis, which in turn has influenced writers such as Alexander Pope, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqué, Charles Baudelaire and Anatole France. The dramatist Jean Giraudoux explicitly states his debt to Paracelsus in the preface to his 1938 play Ondine. ==References== ===Citations=== ===Sources=== * * * * * Category:1566 books Category:Paracelsus Category:Christian theology books Category:Christian cosmology Category:Elementals Category:Works based on European myths and legends Category:Literature of the German Renaissance Category:16th-century Latin books Category:Books published posthumously
37312423	A Book to Burn	A Book to Burn () is a late 16th-century philosophical work by the late-Ming Dynasty thinker and historian Li Zhi. A critique of the social, philosophical and cultural norms of his time, the book was highly controversial and cemented Li Zhi's reputation as a heretic at the time. ==History== Li Zhi began compiling the book in 1588, while living in a Buddhist monastery. It was first published in 1590 in Macheng, with a foreword by Mei Guozhen. The title was chosen by Li Zhi, who was aware that the book would be highly controversial, and that calls for its burning would be inevitable. Indeed, soon after its publication, it incited a vitriolic response from the exponents of Cheng-Zhu orthodoxy, accusing Li of heresy and poisoning minds; this controversy, however, only served to heighten Li Zhi's reputation. In 1602, after the imprisonment and suicide of Li Zhi, the book was proscribed and all copies were burned; this ban proceeded even into the Qing Dynasty. Yet, while officially banned, it continued to be printed and distributed in private. ==Contents== The book is divided into six chapters. Chapters one and two are responses to other books and philosophical works, while chapters three and four are essays on assorted topics. Chapter five deals with the study of history, and the last chapter contains poetic works. The book contains Li's defences of the School of Heart, influenced by the teachings of the earlier scholar Wang Yangming, against the Cheng-Zhu school. Among other arguments, it derided the ritual worship of Confucius as superstition, as well as the study of the classics in pursuit of understanding an 'absolute morality'. Instead, Li argued for a more intuitive understanding of virtue and morality, and of giving greater space for individualism, instead of 'taking Confucius' (idea of) right or wrong as the only idea of right or wrong'. ==References== ==Further reading== Phillip Grimberg, Dem Feuer geweiht: Das Lishi Fenshu des Li Zhi (1527-1602).

45183794	A Borrowed Identity	A Borrowed Identity (; ;) is a 2014 Israeli drama film directed by Eran Riklis. It is based on Sayed Kashua's book Dancing Arabs (2002). In Canada the film was released under the title Dancing Arabs, which was the film's English- language title at its world premiere (one reviewer noted that the title "will prove tricky in marketing campaigns"). The film was considered a flop in Israel, with only 48,000 views, despite an $11 million budget. It tells the story of Eyad, an Israeli-Palestinian teenager from Tira who moves to Jerusalem to attend an elite Jewish high school, where he meets Naomi, a Jewish student, and falls in love with her. As part of his school-mandated community service, he meets Yonatan, who suffers from muscular dystrophy, and his mother Edna. ==Cast== *Tawfeek Barhom as Eyad *Michael Moshonov as Yonatan *Yael Abecassis as Edna, Yonatan's mother *Danielle Kitsis as Naomi *Ali Suliman as Salah, Eyad's father *Marlene Bajali as Aisha, Eyad's grandmother *Laëtitia Eïdo as Fahima, Eyad's mother ==Plot== Eyad (Tawfeek Barhom) is a gifted Palestinian teenager who is accepted to an elite Israeli school. His father (Ali Suliman) drives him to Jerusalem and drops Eyad off at the new school. Before entering the school, Eyad's Father tells him that the Palestinian people once longed to defeat their Jewish enemies, but will now settle for being able to live side by side with dignity. In school, he struggles to adapt. His Israeli peers refer to him as "Ayid" and he is looked down upon by the others. Things change once he meets Naomi (Danielle Kitsis); he helps her with her chemistry schoolwork and the two start to meet at a cafe. Yonatan (Michael Moshonov) is a disabled Israeli teen whom Eyad is assigned by the school to visit. Eyad and Yonatan develop a strong bond, as they are both considered outsiders. Back in school, Eyad and Naomi fall in love and meet up constantly, however, things begin to get complicated. Eyad excels in the classroom and begins to earn the trust and respect of his Jewish peers. He begins to sell falafel and bagels and starts to finally feel comfortable at the school. One day, as Eyad and Naomi are walking in the streets, Naomi asks Eyad to tell her he loves her in Arabic, whereupon an Israeli soldier overhears Eyad, asks to see his ID card, and aggressively questions him. In English class, Eyad and Naomi declare their love to the others and want to tell the world about their relationship. Once Naomi tells her parents about her Palestinian boyfriend, she is no longer allowed to go back to school. Eyad also drops out of school and asks the principal to inform Naomi's parents that she can now go back to school as he is no longer there. The decision angers Eyad's father and he is no longer welcome at home, so he moves to a flat in East Jerusalem and begins to seek work as a waiter. After many unsuccessful attempts, he lands a job as a dishwasher. By this point, Yonatan's health has deteriorated significantly and he is no longer able to move. Yonatan's mother asks Eyad to move in with them, as she trusts him and cannot take care of Yonatan by herself. Eyad realizes that he and Yonatan resemble each other, takes Yonatan's Israeli ID, and becomes a waiter. Yonatan's mother (Yael Abecassis) finds out, but allows Eyad to continue as long as no one ever finds out. Using Yonatan's ID, Eyad takes Yonatan's final exams and scores highly for both of them. Naomi serves in the IDF and tells Eyad that she is sick of lying and chooses to break things off. A while later, Yonatan dies, while Eyad (posing as Yonatan) informs the Muslim authorities that the Muslim Eyad has died. Eyad and Yonatan's mother attend the funeral and the screen goes white. ==Reception== Godfrey Cheshire of the RogerEbert.com gave A Borrowed Identity 3 out of 5, while Stephanie Merry of The Washington Post gave it 3 out of 4 stars. Metacritic gave the film an approval of 73%, based on 14 reviews while Rotten Tomatoes gave Dancing Arabs 93%, based on 30 reviews. John Anderson of Newsday who called the film A Borrowed Life, gave it 3 out of 4 stars and compared it to Zaytoun. He also praised its camerawork, music, and characters. Michael Nazarewycz gave A Borrowed Identity 9 out of 10 and called it a "must see indie". A Borrowed Identity was released on DVD on 29 October 2015. ==References== ==External links== * * * ==Further reading== * * * * Category:Israeli drama films Category:2010s Arabic-language films Category:Interfaith romance films Category:Films about interracial romance Category:Films based on Israeli novels Category:Films directed by Eran Riklis Category:2014 drama films
58299136	A Borrowed Life	A Borrowed Life () is a 1994 Taiwanese film and the directorial debut of Wu Nien-jen. The film depicts cultural and regime change in Taiwan. The film's running time is 167 minutes. Reviews by Ken Eisner in Variety and Stephen Holden in The New York Times noted that the film was autobiographical and told largely from the perspective of director Wu Nien-jen as a child. Eisner was critical of the film for its excessive focus on the father-son relationship, which left other characters' viewpoints unexplored. Chen Kuan-Hsing examined languages and dialects used in the film, linking differences to the cultural changes portrayed within, as Japanese rule was lifted and the Kuomintang assumed control of Taiwan. ==Selected cast== *Tsai Chen-nan as Sega *Kerris Tsai as Sega's wife *Chung Yo-hong, Cheng Kwei-chung and Fu Jun as Wen Jian *Peng Wan-chun as sister *Lee Chuo-liang as brother *Akio Chen as Nomu, Sega's neighbor * as Sega's mother * as Sega's father *, Akiko, Nomu's wife *Chen Shu-fang, Akiko's mother ==Awards and reception== The film won the Grand Prize (Prize of the City of Torino for Best Film - International Feature Film Competition) at the Torino Film Festival in Italy, a FIPRESCI/NETPAC Award at the 1995 Singapore International Film Festival and the Silver Alexander Award as well as the FIPRESCI Prize (International Federation of Film Critics Award) at the 1994 Thessaloniki Film Festival in Greece. It also received the Golden Horse Audience Choice Award.

53686604	A Borrowed Man	A Borrowed Man is a 2015 science fiction hardboiled noir novel by Gene Wolfe. ==Plot== In the 22nd century, Ern A. Smithe is a "reclone" of a mystery writer, embedded with the recorded memories of his original and stored in a library where patrons can consult or borrow him. He is checked out by a woman who hopes that he can help solve the deaths of her father and brother, because her father's safe had contained nothing except one of Smithe's novels. However, Smithe's original was not a detective, only someone who wrote about them — and his knowledge of the world is over a century out of date. ==Reception== At Strange Horizons, John Clute stated that it was "almost (...) the saddest story I have ever heard", and "not (...) quite the most adamantly terminal novel Gene Wolfe has ever written", noting that its many apparent stylistic flaws are deliberate (for instance, Smithe's narration is in the style of a hardboiled mystery because, as a reclone, his speech production has been artificially constrained). Clute also observed that the name "Ern A. Smithe" can be parsed as "an urn in which a smith resides, a maker you can rent". Scores, by John Clute, at Strange Horizons; published November 2, 2015; retrieved April 4, 2017 In the Chicago Tribune, Gary K.

55228300	A Boy Born from Mold and Other Delectable Morsels	A Boy Born from Mold and Other Delectable Morsels is the second book of children's short stories by Lorin Morgan-Richards. Originally published in 2010, Richards's book of gloomy tales pokes fun at the absurdities of life. ==Humor== The book is largely compared to Edward Gorey and Tim Burton but characteristically weaves a deeper expression of sentiment not found in his earlier collection. Richards relates how the title story has been perceived by the readers: Some have thought of it as giving insight into some sort of pagan beliefs. One commented it was a metaphor for the Celtic Tree of Life. The little girl upstairs represents an above plane while 'Rune' resides in the below or Otherworld, and the remaining between provides the journey towards consciousness of spirit and self-interconnected. I will not say if these are accurate or intentional in any way, but obviously, the story itself was meant to fascinate adults as well as children, and like one reviewer mentioned, this story is fundamentally about finding oneself. Further reading reveals Zoog is a vampire who is hiding his allergy to blood and is found staring at a rainbow, while a woman accidentally feeds her 100 cats a sponge instead of cheese, and a man questions his existence only to be mistaken for a garden gnome. ==Contents== * A Boy Born from Mold * Lawrence Little * The Misanthropic Plunger * The Cold Pigeon Who Found Comfort in a Mock Owl * The Cryptic Life of Penny Brown * The Fruit Bat * The Finicky Cats * A Rare Benign Belbow (2014 Paperback edition) * Willy Nilleee and the Red-Tailed Squirrel (2014 Paperback edition) ==Editions== Modeling the construction of his first book Simon Snootle and Other Small Stories, Richards produced a pocket-sized handmade first edition of the book using dark blue faux leather with hand sewn linen pages inside. The cover was in a light blue background with an illustration of Ruin from the title story, who appears to be wearing several cultural tokens. A paperback edition of the book was released in 2014 with a cover showing Rune (Ruin) with a rat teaching him how to write, and the young vampire Zoog behind him. The paperback includes two stories not published in the first edition: "A Rare Benign Belbow" (originally released in 2011 with The Terribly Mini Monster Book) and "Willy Nillee and the Red-Tailed Squirrel". ==Audiobook== The audiobook features the narration of Jason Shepherd with a special music introduction by Seongje Hwang and Tae Sung Jie. ==References== Category:2010 children's books Category:2010 short story collections Category:Children's short story collections Category:American picture books Category:Black comedy books Category:Short stories about cats Category:Children's books about cats
36875415	A Boy Bringing Bread	A Boy Bringing Bread (c. 1663) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch painter Pieter de Hooch. It is an example of Dutch Golden Age painting and is part of The Wallace Collection. ==Descriptions and commentary== A boy offers a basket of bread to a lady in an interior; behind them a tiled courtyard leads into another dark interior, beyond which can be seen a canal with a second woman, possibly the boy's mother, watching the transaction from afar. With its masterly illusion of receding depth, the picture demonstrates De Hooch's sensitivity to differing effects of daylight in adjoining spaces, in this case through a series of indoor and outdoor spaces. Originally a girl reading a book sat in the doorway, but she was painted out in favour of the lady and the boy, whose stance echoes the verticality of the architecture and prompts the eye to travel upwards into the picture space. By paring down his composition De Hooch focuses the viewer's attention and imbues the scene with intensified quietude.Wallace Collection Online This painting by Hooch was documented by Hofstede de Groot in 1910, who wrote: > 34\.

Nikolas' mother had died two years before, eaten by a bear, and Nikolas tries to take comfort every night remembering the legend of a place called Elfhelm, where a girl found a magical place inhabited by elves that helped her to survive the winter. One night a mouse tries to steal some food but his life is spared by Nikolas who calls the mouse Miika and tries to teach him to speak. One day, the King calls his subjects and promises a big reward if someone is able to find an object that would bring hope to the kingdom. Joel joins a group of hunters to try to find Elfhelm. Joel leaves Nikolas under the care of Aunt Carlotta, a selfish woman who makes Nikolas' life miserable. Nikolas finds a map that confirms the existence of Elfhelm so he decides to go to the Extreme North to find his father and give him the map. During the journey, Nikolas learns that Miika has learned to speak and this provides hope in continuing his quest. When they reach the Half Moon Forest, a reindeer who Nikolas names Blitzen allows Nikolas to mount him. The trio reaches Elfhelm but finds nothing there except for Joel's knife. Nikolas loses hope and collapses. He is found by Little Noosh and Father Topo. Father Topo gives Nikolas a "hope spell" that allows him to recover. Father Topo informs him that he is in Elfhelm, but it is only visible to the people who believe in the place. Nikolas is able to see the place after believing in the elves and tries to stay in the town. He learns that a group of humans, including Joel, has kidnapped a small elf called Little Kip. Nikolas is sentenced to be eaten by a troll in the Dark Tower. Nikolas manages to escape with the help of a young fairy called the Truth Pixie. He then decides to try to find Joel's party and clarify the misunderstanding. In the forest, Nikolas finds a group of hunters and Little Kip, but he is trapped by the hunters and discovers his father is along with them. Joel has a change of heart and comes up with a plan. He frees Nikolas, Little Kip, and Blitzen and they run away from the hunters. Blitzen is unable to lift the sled with Joel sitting in it, so he decides to sacrifice himself to allow the trio to fly away. Nikolas comes back to Elfhelm with Little Kip and he is able to bring the little elf on time to prevent Father Topo from being punished. Little Kip's parents reward Nikolas with the elves' traditional making of toys. Nikolas then has an idea and has all the elves create bountiful gifts of toys and candies. Nikolas is about to ride Blitzen with the gifts when he is confronted by Mother Vodol. She sees the locket he carries with him showing the portrait of her mother, revealing that the girl who reached Elfhelm in the legend is none other than Nikolas's mother. Mother Vodol then tells him about how she lost faith in the humans when news spread in the place that the men (including Joel) took Little Kip. Nikolas tells her that his mother always remembered how joyful it was in Elfhelm. Nikolas goes back to the kingdom one night and he shows himself to the King, offering one of the toys. Confused, the King asks him about the meaning of the gift, leading Nikolas to take him to all the houses in the kingdom to leave toys for the children while trying to not disturb them. The King is moved and decides to help him. Finishing the story, Aunt Ruth explains to the children the meaning of Nikolas's actions and she felt that one of them has already accepted the fate of their mother and is learning to live with that. The children already figure the boy is Santa Claus. The children's father comes back, to find to their surprise that the living room is filled with Christmas ornaments and presents. Aunt Ruth then leaves the place and throws a firecracker in the ending scene, revealing herself to be the Truth Pixie. ==Cast== ==Production== A deal was completed in May 2016 for the book to be adapted into film by Blueprint Pictures and StudioCanal.

18040146	A Boy Called Hate	A Boy Called Hate is a 1995 American crime drama film starring Scott Caan, his father James Caan, Missy Crider, Adam Beach and Elliott Gould. It was the first film directed by Mitch Marcus, who also wrote the screenplay. ==Plot== Steve (Scott Caan) is a maladjusted Los Angeles teenager who renames himself "Hate" following a run-in with the local police. He lives with his father (James Caan), who is bilking a former employer in a workers compensation fraud scheme. One evening while taking a motorcycle ride, Hate witnesses what appears to be an attempted rape. He shoots the would-be attacker and takes off with Cindy, the young girl being assaulted (Missy Crider). It turns out that the rapist is an assistant district attorney (Elliott Gould), who survives the shooting and falsely reports that he was the victim of a robbery. Hate and Cindy leave Los Angeles, but their situation deteriorates when Hate fatally shoots a motorcycle officer whom he mistakenly believes has come to arrest him.Variety review ==Critical reaction== A Boy Called Hate had a brief theatrical release in June 1996 and received mixed reviews. Peter Stack, reviewing the film for the San Francisco Chronicle, suggested that "Two aspects of A Boy Called Hate are definitely worth the trip to the Lumiere, where the film opens today: James Caan's look-alike son, Scott, plays the lead role, and writer-director Mitch Marcus succeeds in capturing the grim essence of Los Angeles' arid outskirts as a tacky wasteland." Ella Taylor, reviewing the film for the LA Weekly wrote, "Mitch Marcus' first feature is living proof that the most fatigued of plots (young lovers-on-the-run-plus-gun) can be recharged by a director who understands the difference between exploration and exploitation." ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1995 films Category:1995 crime drama films Category:American crime drama films Category:1990s English-language films Category:Films directed by Mitch Marcus Category:1990s American films

When his wife dies of cancer, an overworked engineer struggles to care for his son with autism. In response to bullying, the young boy regresses into a fantasy world escape.

Film Daily less favorably states, "A Boy Called Po might have the best of intentions, and Asher clearly meant well with it, but that doesn’t cure its cloying and saccharine tone, falling prey as it does to the same old autism fiction tropes." Dove.org considers: "Po is an inspiring story about a committed father, David Wilson (Christopher Gorham), and his love and concern for his autistic son, Patrick, fondly called “Po”." Movieguide.org states: "A Boy Called Po is an engaging, low budget movie with a strong, powerful climax. There are a few endings after the climax, but they each resolve several important issues. The heart of this movie is the relationship between the father and his son." == Awards == In 2016, the film won the Gold Remi Award at Worldfest Houston, the Festival Award for Breakthrough Feature at the San Diego International Film Festival, Best Feature at the Palm Beach International Film Festival, Outstanding Achievement in Filmmaking, Music, at the Newport Beach Film Festival, Best Actor (Julian Feder) at the Albuquerque Film & Music Experience, Best Actor (Julian Feder) at the Young Artists Awards as well as being nominated for many other accolades. == References == ==External links== Category:2016 films Category:2010s American films Category:2010s English-language films Category:American drama films Category:Films about autism Category:Films about father–son relationships Category:Films scored by Burt Bacharach

23583555	A Boy Like That	"A Boy Like That/I Have A Love" is a song from the 1957 Broadway musical West Side Story, with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim. In the musical, the song is sung by the characters Anita and Maria. For the original Broadway cast recording, the song was performed by Chita Rivera (Anita) and Carol Lawrence (Maria). In the 1961 film version the roles were played by Rita Moreno and Natalie Wood, but the songs were dubbed by Betty Wand and Marni Nixon (as both Anita and Maria). However, the repeat of the two stanzas, sung by Anita, along with Maria's counterpoint of her defense, was omitted because of the complexity of the song, as well as to avoid the repetition, which would have slowed down the pace of the film. In the 2021 film, the roles were played by Ariana DeBose and Rachel Zegler. In 2010, Lin- Manuel Miranda and Raúl Esparza performed the song at Broadway Backwards, an annual Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS showcase of show tunes sung by different genders. Miranda played Anita, while Esparza played Maria. ==Selena version== In 1995 Selena recorded "A Boy Like That" for the various-artists compilation album The Songs of West Side Story, which was a benefit for AIDS Project Los Angeles. Her version of the song was released posthumously as a single in 1996 by RCA Victor, with the maxi-single including four remixes by Tony Moran. The song was also included on the soundtrack album Selena. David Pack produced the track and Sheila E. performed percussion. Additional vocals were provided by Michelle Weeks, Godwin, and Nikki Richards. ===Track listing=== US remixes # "A Boy Like That" (radio edit 1) - 4:06 # "A Boy Like That" (radio edit 2) - 4:06 # "A Boy Like That" (original edit) - 3:28 # "A Boy Like That" (extended remix) - 8:14 # "A Boy Like That" (guitar mix) - 4:54 # "A Boy Like That" (dub mix) - 8:40 # "A Boy Like That" (tribal mix) - 7:13 # "A Boy Like That" (original full version) - 5:51 ==References== Category:1957 songs Category:1997 singles Category:EMI Records singles Category:Selena songs Category:Songs from West Side Story Category:Songs with music by Leonard Bernstein Category:Songs released posthumously Category:Songs written by Stephen Sondheim

The first section, titled Fledgling, describes Stark's life before the outbreak of World War II, living his early years in Podhoryan near Munkacs. The author created for him fictional pet dove named "Taibele" as a device for the protagonist to share his thoughts. The first section concludes with the Jewish community of Carpatho-Ruthenia's deportation to Auschwitz in mid-1944. The story's second section talks about Stark's ordeals in the Holocaust, from the grueling slave labor in Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Melk to the death march to Ebensee. In Part Three, the book tells about recovering and rebuilding after the Holocaust, with Stark's emigration to the United States. Throughout the story, there are full-color illustrations by Gadi Pollack and Alex Firley. At the end of the book are over 130 pages of Appendices: a glossary; a historical overview of Europe between 1914 and 1948; a timeline of events and maps, tracing Stark's life as well as the region's Jewish history at that time in general; an explanation to of the book's illustrations; a learning guide, extracting lessons in history, geography, phsycolgy, Judaism, etc. from the story; and "Srulik's Personal Album", photographs of Stark, his family, and related objects. == Reception == The book received much praise from Jewish and Holocaust Memorial organizations. Linda Hooper, coordinator of the Paper Clips Project and the Children's Holocaust Memorial in Whitwell, Tennessee said that the book "will bring the realities of the effects of intolerance and mob mentality to life for students," and that "this is a story that should be shared!" Rabbi Israel Meir Lau, chairman of the Yad Vashem Council and former Chief Rabbi of Israel, called the book "spellbinding" and said that "[Starck is] an ember saved from the inferno of World War II."

The director of the Kleinman Family Holocaust Education Center, Sholom Friedman said it's "a poignant memoir," and Rabbi Shmuel Yaakov Klein, director of publications of Torah Umesorah, said that the publication is "a valuable source...heartrending...brimming with content...a welcome addition to Holocaust curricula." Rabbi Berel Wein, director of The Destiny Foundation, wrote in an approbation that "the book is filled with fascinating detail, drama and a touch of necessary irony," and Esther Farbstein, a notable Holocaust historian, wrote that she hopes "it will reach a wide audience of young people." Nachum Segal of the JM in the AM radio show interviewed Starck about the book. == References == Category:Personal accounts of the Holocaust Category:Children's books about the Holocaust Category:2015 non-fiction books Category:2015 children's books Category:Children's non-fiction books Category:Children's books set in Ukraine Category:Children's books set in the United States Category:Children's books about immigration Category:Children's books set in the 1930s Category:Children's books set in the 1940s Category:Children's books set in Poland Category:Children's books set in Austria
3163760	A Boy Named Charlie Brown	A Boy Named Charlie Brown is a 1969 American animated musical comedy-drama film, produced by Cinema Center Films, distributed by National General Pictures, and directed by Bill Melendez. It is the first feature film based on the Peanuts comic strip. It was well-received and a box-office success, grossing $12 million. == Plot == When Charlie Brown's baseball team loses the first game of the season, he becomes convinced that he will not win any of them. On the way to school one day, Lucy jokingly suggests that he enter the school spelling bee. However, Linus considers it a good idea and encourages him despite the jeers of Lucy, Violet, and Patty ("Failure Face"). Charlie Brown nervously enters the spelling bee and defeats his classmates. As he studies for the school championship, he and Linus sing a spelling mnemonic ("I Before E") as Snoopy accompanies them on a Jew's harp. In class the next day, Charlie Brown freezes when challenged with perceive, but recovers when Snoopy plays the song's accompaniment outside the classroom window. Crowned champion, his classmates cheerfully follow him home and sing ("Champion Charlie Brown"). Lucy proclaims herself his agent, and when his friends suggest that he continue studying, he is confused. They tell Charlie Brown that he must now take part in the National Spelling Bee in New York City, and he is again filled with self-doubt. As Charlie Brown leaves, Linus reluctantly offers him his blanket for good luck, and the other kids cheer for him. Back at home, Linus suffers terrible withdrawal after being separated from his blanket. Unable to withstand without it, he pleads with Snoopy to go to New York City and help him recover it. They meet with an exhausted Charlie Brown in his hotel room, but he does not know where he left Linus' blanket. After searching outside of the hotel, they return to him, only to find him absentmindedly using the blanket as a shoe-shine cloth. Linus joins Snoopy in the audience as Charlie Brown competes; the other kids watch the contest at home on television. One-by-one, the other contestants are eliminated until only Charlie Brown and one other boy remain. Although Charlie Brown spells several words correctly (fussbudget, disastrous and incompetent), he is eliminated when he accidentally misspells beagle as B–E–A–G–E–L (Snoopy's breed), much to his and everyone else's frustration. Lucy, who is equally ashamed that Charlie Brown lost, says he made her mad and turns off the TV angrily. Despite finishing as the national runner-up, Charlie Brown returns home, depressed, along with Linus and Snoopy. The next day, Linus visits him. He has been in his bed all day and refuses to see or talk to anybody. Linus tells him that the other kids missed him at school and that his baseball team finally won their first game of the season, but Charlie says he will never return to school or do anything again. As Linus leaves, he now points out that the world did not end despite his failure. He thinks for a moment, gets dressed, and goes outside. He sees the other kids playing, and when he spots Lucy as she plays with a football, he sneaks up behind her to kick it. She pulls it away and welcomes him home and the two look at the camera before the film fades to black. == Cast == * Peter Robbins as Charlie Brown * Pamelyn Ferdin as Lucy van Pelt * Glenn Gilger as Linus van Pelt * Andy Pforsich as Schroeder * Sally Dryer as Patty * Bill Melendez as Snoopy * Anne Altieri as Violet * Erin Sullivan as Sally Brown * Lynda Mendelson as Frieda * Christopher DeFaria as Pig-Pen Shermy appears in this film but doesn't have a speaking role. Peppermint Patty and 5 also appear in silent roles. == Production == === Development === The film was partly based on a series of Peanuts comic strips originally published in newspapers in February 1966. That story had a much different ending: Charlie Brown was eliminated in his class spelling bee right away for misspelling the word maze ("M–A–Y–S" while thinking of baseball legend Willie Mays), thus confirming Violet's prediction that he would make a fool of himself. He then screams at his teacher in frustration, causing him to be sent to the principal's office (A few gags from that storyline, however, were also used in You're in Love, Charlie Brown). === Music === The film also included several original songs, some of which boasted vocals for the first time: "Failure Face", "I Before E" and "Champion Charlie Brown" (Before the film, musical pieces in Peanuts specials were primarily instrumental, except for a few traditional songs in A Charlie Brown Christmas.) Rod McKuen wrote and sang the title song. He also wrote "Failure Face" and "Champion Charlie Brown". The instrumental tracks interspersed throughout the film were composed by Vince Guaraldi and arranged by John Scott Trotter (who also wrote "I Before E"). The music consisted mostly of uptempo jazz tunes that had been heard since some of the earliest Peanuts television specials aired back in 1965; however, for the film, they were given a more "theatrical" treatment, with lusher horn-filled arrangements. Instrumental tracks used in it included "Skating" (first heard in A Charlie Brown Christmas) and "Baseball Theme" (first heard in Charlie Brown's All-Stars). When discussing the augmentation of Guaraldi's established jazz scores with additional musicians, Lee Mendelson commented, "It wasn't that we thought Vince's jazz couldn't carry the movie, but we wanted to supplement it with some 'big screen music.' We focused on Vince for the smaller, more intimate Charlie Brown scenes; for the larger moments, we turned to Trotter's richer, full-score sound."Bang, Derrick. Liner notes for A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack (2017); Kritzerland, Inc. Retrieved 7 May 2020 Guaraldi's services were passed over entirely for the second Peanuts feature film, Snoopy Come Home, with Mendelson turning to longtime Disney composers, the Sherman Brothers, to compose the music score. The segment during the "Skating" sequence was choreographed by American figure skater Skippy Baxter. A segment during the middle of the film, in which Schroeder plays the entire 2nd Movement of Beethoven's Sonata Pathétique was performed by Ingolf Dahl. Dahl also performs the excerpts of the 1st and 3rd movements which appear in the film and are also played by Schroeder. Only the 3rd Movement (Rondo: Allegro) can be found on A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack and only as a shortened bonus track. The film also features a Jew's harp, which Snoopy plays to help Charlie Brown with his spelling. Vince Guaraldi's songs were mostly from other specials and included (in addition to "Skating" and "Baseball Theme") "Blue Charlie Brown", "Good Grief", "Snoopy Surfing", and "Linus and Lucy" (several renditions are featured, including 2 slowed down renditions, one in minor key, featured while Linus was looking for his blanket and of course, the traditional rendition when he finally finds it). Guaraldi also plays a rendition of "Champion Charlie Brown" in the opening credits on the piano. The French-language version replaces Rod McKuen's vocals with a French version sung by Serge Gainsbourg, "". A soundtrack album with dialogue from the film was released on the Columbia Masterworks label in 1970 titled A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack.

The film was well received by critics and holds a 95% rating at Rotten Tomatoes based on 22 reviews, with an average rating of 7.50/10. Time praised its use of "subtle, understated colors" and its scrupulous fidelity to the source material, calling it a message film that "should not be missed." The New York Times Vincent Canby wrote: "A practically perfect screen equivalent to the quiet joys to be found in almost any of Charles M. Schulz's Peanuts comic strips. I do have some reservations about the film, but it's difficult—perhaps impossible—to be anything except benign towards a G-rated, animated movie that manages to include references to St. Stephen, Thomas Eakins, Harpers Ferry, baseball, contemporary morality (as it relates to Charlie Brown's use of his 'bean ball'), conservation and kite flying. " The film was a success at the box office, earning $12 million."November 2015 Box Office Forecast", 5 November 2015, p. 3.Boxofficeprophets.com In its first week at Radio City Music Hall, it grossed $230,000, including a record $60,123 on Saturday, December 6. In its second week, it grossed $290,000 which made it number one in the United States. A 1971 Associated Press story argued the success of the film "broke the Disney monopoly" on animated feature films that had existed since the 1937 release of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. "The success of 'Peanuts' started a trend", animation producer Fred Calvert told the AP, "but I hope the industry is not misled into thinking that animation is the only thing. You need to have a solid story and good characters, too. Audiences are no longer fascinated by the fact that Mickey Mouse can spit." === Awards and nominations === The film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song Score, but lost to The Beatles' Let It Be. == Home media == The film was first released on VHS and Betamax in July 1983 through CBS/Fox Video, before seeing another VHS, Betamax, and LaserDisc release in 1984, then several more in 1985, September 26, 1991, February 20, 1992, and 1995 by CBS Home Entertainment through 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, and May 29, 2001, through Paramount Home Entertainment, before making its Region 1 DVD debut in the original 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen aspect ratio on March 28, 2006, by Paramount Home Entertainment/CBS Home Entertainment (co-producer Cinema Center Films was owned by CBS). The DVD has more than six minutes of footage not seen since the 1969 test screening and premiere. The footage consists of new scenes completely excised from earlier home video releases (VHS, CED Laserdisc, Japanese DVD) and TV prints — most notably, a scene of Lucy's infamous "pulling-away-the-football" trick after her slide presentation of Charlie Brown's faults (and her instant replay thereof), as well as extending existing scenes. The film was released on Blu-ray on September 6, 2016, along with Snoopy Come Home, however, unlike the DVD releases, both films are presented in an open-matte 4:3 ratio.Amazon.com The film earned $6 million in rentals."Big Rental Films of 1970", Variety, 6 January 1971, p. 11.A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1969) – Box office / business == See also == * Peanuts filmography * Snoopy, Come Home * Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown * Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (And Don't Come Back!) * The Peanuts Movie == References == == External links == * * * * Category:Peanuts films Category:1969 films Category:1969 animated films Category:1960s American animated films Category:1960s musical comedy-drama films Category:American children's animated comedy films Category:American musical comedy-drama films Category:Children's comedy-drama films Category:Cinema Center Films films Category:Comics adapted into animated films Category:1960s English-language films Category:Films about spelling competitions Category:Films based on American comics Category:Films directed by Bill Melendez Category:Animated films set in New York City Category:Peanuts music Category:Films with screenplays by Charles M.

18117912	A Boy Named Charlie Brown (1963 film)	A Boy Named Charlie Brown is an unaired television documentary film about Charles M. Schulz and his creation Peanuts, produced by Lee Mendelson with some animated scenes by Bill Melendez and music by Vince Guaraldi. ==Background== On October 6, 1963, a documentary producer and KPIX-TV PSA announcer named Lee Mendelson released a television documentary film about the life and career of baseball legend Willie Mays entitled A Man Named Mays, which aired on NBC that same day. In mid-December 1963, two months after the documentary was released, Mendelson decided that following his film about the best baseball player, he would produce a film about the worst baseball player, Charlie Brown. Mendelson subsequently hired animator Bill Melendez, who had experience working with the Peanuts characters in a handful of commercials for the Ford Motor Company from 1959 until 1962, to direct some interstitial animation based on the strips. A Boy Named Charlie Brown was screened for the Greater San Francisco Advertising Club in the Spring of 1964, where it was received with considerable enthusiasm, but Mendelson was unsuccessful in securing sponsorship. Although the special never aired on television and later forfeited, the documentary was instrumental in starting the Greater San Francisco Advertising Committee and garnering commercial support and the creative teamwork that resulted in A Charlie Brown Christmas in 1965 and the ensuing series of Peanuts television specials. It was the first film to carry the Greater San Francisco Advertising Committee policy. An album by the Vince Guaraldi Trio with music from the above documentary, originally titled Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown, was released by Fantasy Records in 1964. Portions of the unaired A Boy Named Charlie Brown were later broadcast in 1969 as Charlie Brown and Charles Schulz, a CBS documentary that preceded the release of Peanuts' first motion picture, also called A Boy Named Charlie Brown.Bang, Derrick.

64988053	A Boy Named Charlie Brown (soundtrack)	The 1969 animated film A Boy Named Charlie Brown, based on Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts, had two different soundtrack albums. These albums were released individually in 1970 and 2017. ==Background== A Boy Named Charlie Brown is the debut theatrical film based on the Peanuts comic strip by Charles M. Schulz. For the music score, producer Lee Mendelson recruited jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi, who had previously composed uptempo jazz melodies for the first six Peanuts television specials as well as the unaired documentary of the same name. Guaraldi did not compose new songs for the film, but instead fitted established compositions with a more theatrical treatment featuring lusher horn-filled arrangements. Instrumental tracks used in the film included new versions of the songs "Skating", "Baseball Theme", "Charlie Brown and His All-Stars", "Oh, Good Grief", "Air Music", "Blue Charlie Brown", and several variations of the Peanuts franchise theme song, "Linus and Lucy". Guaraldi also resurrected the non-Peanuts song "Lucifer's Lady" from his album The Eclectic Vince Guaraldi (1969), retitled "Kite Music (Lucifer's Lady)". To fill out the sound, Mendelson also hired composer/arranger John Scott Trotter (who also worked in concert with Guaraldi since 1966's It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown) and composer/singer Rod McKuen. When discussing the augmentation of Guaraldi's established jazz scores with additional musicians, Mendelson commented, "It wasn’t that we thought Vince's jazz couldn't carry the movie, but we wanted to supplement it with some 'big screen music.' We focused on Vince for the smaller, more intimate Charlie Brown scenes; for the larger moments, we turned to Trotter's richer, full-score sound." Guaraldi's services were passed over entirely for the second Peanuts feature film, Snoopy Come Home, with Mendelson turning to longtime Disney composers the Sherman Brothers to compose the music score. The film included several original songs, some of which boasted vocals: "Failure Face", "I Before E" and "Champion Charlie Brown". McKuen wrote and sang the title song, as well as writing "Failure Face" and "Champion Charlie Brown". Trotter composed additional songs, like "Cloud Dreams", "Catatonic Blues" and "Bus Wheel Blues". Several recording sessions occurred between April and October 1969, all under the supervision of Trotter. He and Guaraldi booked several jazz combos for one date; Guaraldi worked solely with trio sidemen Peter Marshall and Jerry Granelli on another. A soundtrack album with dialogue from the film was released on the Columbia Masterworks label in 1970 titled A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack. The first all-music version of the soundtrack was released on CD by Kritzerland Records as a limited issue of 1,000 copies in 2017, titled A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack. ==A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack== A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack is the first of two soundtracks issued for the film, released in early 1970. The soundtrack was a commercial success and was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score, ultimately losing to The Beatles' Let It Be. A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack was out of print by 1973. , it has not been issued on CD. Unlike traditional music soundtracks, A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Selections from the Film Soundtrack was presented as a condensed book-and-record radio play version of the film, running approximately 50 minutes in length. Most musical segments act as underscores behind dialogue. === Track listing === Despite individual tracks being listed on the album, track running times for each title were not published. == A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack == A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the second of two soundtracks issued for the film. It was released on CD by Kritzerland Records in 2017 with a limited run of 1,000 copies,A Boy Named Charlie Brown: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack at kritzerland.com which sold out within one week of release. Vince Guaraldi historian and author Derrick Bang referred to the 2017 release as the "Guaraldi Holy Grail" for fans of the jazz pianist. For many years, the logistics involved in releasing a music-only soundtrack were daunting. Licensing issues were complex as both Columbia Masterworks Records and Cinema Center Films had ceased to exist decades earlier and asset ownership passed along to a number of subsequent corporate entities. The music itself also posed challenges, as it involved not only Guaraldi's estate (Guaraldi died in 1976), but those associated with John Scott Trotter and Rod McKuen, who had died in 1975 and 2015, respectively. === Track listing === Track 18, "Linus and Lucy (Found Blanket)", is the same flute-driven, monaural version used during the cold open scene in It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown (1966). === Personnel === Credits were adapted from 2017 liner notes. ;Vince Guaraldi Nonet: * Vince Guaraldi – piano * Conte Candoli – trumpet * Milton Bernhart – trombone * Herb Ellis – guitar * Monty Budwig – double bass * Peter Marshall – double bass * Jerry Granelli – drums * Jack Sperling – drums * Victor Feldman – percussion ;Vince Guaraldi Sextet: *Vince Guaraldi – piano, electric keyboards, arranger *Emmanuel Klein – trumpet *John Gray – guitar *Ronald Lang – woodwinds *Monty Budwig – double bass *Colin Bailey – drums Additional * Phil Macy – engineer (1970 release) * Derrick Bang – liner notes (2017 release) ==References== ==External links== * "You're Finally a Film Score, Charlie Brown": A track-by-track analysis of A Boy Named Charlie Brown by Derrick Bang Category:1970 soundtrack albums Category:2017 soundtrack albums Category:Albums arranged by Vince Guaraldi Category:Vince Guaraldi soundtracks Category:Cool jazz soundtracks Category:Mainstream jazz soundtracks Category:Peanuts music
377172	A Boy Named Goo	A Boy Named Goo is the fifth studio album by American rock band Goo Goo Dolls, released in 1995 on Warner Bros. As a commercial success, it has been RIAA- certified as double-platinum. ==History== This is the Goo Goo Dolls' last studio album with George Tutuska on drums; he was replaced by Mike Malinin just before the album was released. This album is the Goo Goo Dolls' first studio album to not have 14 tracks. The song "Stand Alone" was written by George Tutuska, and because John Rzeznik didn't want to exploit George's efforts after his dismissal, the song was only included on a promo version of the album. On the wide-release version, it is replaced with "Disconnected" and "Slave Girl", which were initially B-sides to the "Only One" single. On the same promo, "Ain't That Unusual" was labeled as "Someday". The two replacement songs are covers of songs by defunct Buffalo and Sydney punk bands The Enemies and Lime Spiders. The song "Name" is well known as the Goo Goo Dolls' first hit. According to lead singer John Rzeznik, the song's unusual composition came about "quite accidentally". This album also marked the band's last with the Metal Blade Records imprint. ==Walmart controversy== On June 5, 1996, the band's label, Warner Bros., released a statement claiming that Walmart had decided to stop selling A Boy Named Goo because some Walmart customers had complained that the album cover was offensive. The statement claimed that some customers had incorrectly thought that the child on the cover was smeared in blood rather than blackberry juice. Walmart acknowledged that they had decided to stop selling the album, but denied Warner Bros.'s claim that this was because of complaints about the cover art, instead ascribing the decision to weak sales. Of the reports that Walmart customers had thought that the child on the cover was smeared in blood, Rzeznik said, "The name of the album is A Boy Named Goo. The picture is of a boy covered with goo. What part of this concept are they unclear on?" == Track listing == All songs written by John Rzeznik, except where noted. ===Original track listing=== The track listing for advance copies—before George Tutuska was fired from the band—was slightly different. ==Covers and media appearances== Haste the Day, a metalcore band, covered the song "Long Way Down" for their album When Everything Falls. The song "Ain't That Unusual" was featured on the soundtrack of the 1995 film Angus. A remix of the song "Long Way Down" was also featured on the soundtrack of the 1996 film Twister. ==Personnel== * John Rzeznik – lead and rhythm guitar, lead and backing vocals * Robby Takac – bass guitar, backing vocals, lead vocals on tracks 2, 5, 8, 10, and 13 * George Tutuska – drums ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1995–1996) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1996) Position US Billboard 200 62 ==Certifications and sales== ==References== Category:Goo Goo Dolls albums Category:1995 albums Category:Warner Records albums Category:Metal Blade Records albums Category:Albums produced by Lou Giordano Category:Obscenity controversies in music
316851	A Boy Named Sue	"A Boy Named Sue" is a song written by humorist, children's author, and poet Shel Silverstein and made popular by Johnny Cash. Cash recorded the song live in concert on February 24, 1969, at California's San Quentin State Prison for his At San Quentin album. Cash also performed the song (with comical variations on the original performance) in December 1969 at Madison Square Garden. The live San Quentin version of the song became Cash's biggest hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and his only top ten single there, spending three weeks at No. 2 in 1969, held out of the top spot by "Honky Tonk Women" by The Rolling Stones. The track also topped the Billboard Hot Country Songs and Easy Listening charts that same year and was certified Gold on August 14, 1969, by the RIAA. Silverstein's own recording was released the same year as "Boy Named Sue", a single on the album Boy Named Sue (and His Other Country Songs), produced by Chet Atkins and Felton Jarvis. ==Content== The song tells the tale of a young man's quest for revenge on a father who abandoned him at three years of age and whose only contribution to his entire life was giving him a guitar and naming him Sue, commonly a feminine name, which results in the young man suffering from ridicule and harassment by everyone he meets. Ashamed of his name, he becomes a hard-hearted nomad as a young man; he swears that he will find and kill his father for giving him "that awful name". Sue later locates his father at a tavern one summer day in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, and after recognizing him by the scar on his cheek and his evil eye confronts him by saying, "My name is Sue! How do you do? Now you're gonna die!" This results in a vicious brawl that spills outdoors into a muddy street. As the two pull their guns on each other, Sue's father smiles with pride and admits that he is the man ("son of a bitch" in the Johnny Cash version) that named him Sue. Because Sue's father knew that he would not be there for his son, he gave him the name as an act of tough love, believing (correctly) that the ensuing ridicule would force him to "get tough or die". Learning this, Sue makes peace and reconciles with his father. Sue closes the song conceding his father's point of view, but that if he ever has a son, he will name the boy "Bill, or George, any damn thing but Sue" because he "still hate(s) that name." ==Structure== The song has an unusual AABCCB rhyme scheme, broken only to mark the midpoint and ending. The song is performed mostly in the speech-like style of talking blues rather than conventional singing.A Boy Named Sue, YouTube.com ==Censorship== The term "son of a bitch" in the line "I'm the son of a bitch that named you Sue!" was bleeped out in the Johnny Cash version both on the single and the At San Quentin album, and the final line was also edited to remove the word "damn". Both the edited and unedited versions are available on various albums and compilations. The term "son of a bitch" was edited to "son of a gun" or altogether bleeped out in some versions. When performing the song live in later performances (such as in April 1970 at the White House and in 1994 at the Glastonbury Festival, for example), Cash would himself utter a bleep-censor sound in lieu of the word. The unedited version of the original San Quentin performance is included on later reissues of the At San Quentin album and on Cash's posthumous The Legend of Johnny Cash album. Silverstein does not utter any profanity in his original version, with Sue's father instead identifying himself as the "heartless hound" that named him Sue. ==Inspiration== The core story of the song was inspired by humorist Jean Shepherd, a close friend of Silverstein, who was often taunted as a child because of his feminine-sounding name.Bergmann, Eugene B.: Excelsior, You Fathead! The Art and Enigma of Jean Shepherd, 2005. The title might also have been inspired by the male attorney Sue K. Hicks of Madisonville, Tennessee, a friend of John Scopes who agreed to be a prosecutor in what was to become known as the "Scopes Monkey Trial". Hicks was named after his mother, who died after giving birth to him."Johnny Cash Is Indebted to a Judge Named Sue". The New York Times, July 12, 1970, p. 66. In his autobiography, Cash wrote that he had just received the song and only read over it a couple of times. It was included in that concert to try it out—he did not know the words and on the filmed recording he can be seen regularly referring to a piece of paper. Cash was surprised at how well the song went over with the audience.Cash, Johnny: Cash: The Autobiography, 1997 The rough, spontaneous performance with sparse accompaniment was included in the Johnny Cash At San Quentin album, ultimately becoming one of Cash's biggest hits. According to Cash biographer Robert Hilburn, neither the British TV crew filming the concert nor his band knew he planned to perform the song; he used a lyric sheet on stage while Perkins and the band improvised the backing on the spot. While another song, "San Quentin", was expected to be the major new song featured in the concert and subsequent album (so much so the album includes two performances of "San Quentin"), "A Boy Named Sue" ended up being the concert's major find.Robert Hilburn, Johnny Cash: The Life (New York: Little, Brown, 2013), p. 353-355;363 Cash also performed it on his own musical variety show, ending the song with the line, "And if I ever have a son, I think I'm gonna name him... John Carter Cash", referring to his newborn son. Cash also performed this variant at the White House in April 1970; in later years, however, he would restore the original "any name but Sue" ending, but change the wording to "if I ever have another son". When Cash performed with The Highwaymen in the 1980s and 1990s, he would end the song by saying "if I ever have another boy, I think I'm gonna name him Waylon, or Willie, or Kris." referring to bandmates Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, and Kris Kristofferson. According to Shel Silverstein's biographer Mitch Myers, it was June Carter Cash who encouraged her husband to perform the song. Silverstein introduced it to them at what they called a "Guitar Pull," where musicians would pass a guitar around and play their songs. Silverstein later wrote a follow-up named "The Father of a Boy Named Sue" on his 1978 Songs and Stories in which he tells the old man's point of view of the story. The only known recording of the song by a major artist is by Shel Silverstein himself. Various cover artists have covered this song since then. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1969) Peak position Australia (Go-Set) 2 South Africa 13 US Billboard Hot Country Singles 1 US Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks 1 US Cash Box Top 100 2 ===Year- end charts=== Chart (1969) Rank Canada 49 US Billboard Hot 100 36 US Adult Contemporary (Billboard)Top Records on 1969 (Based on Billboard Charts)", Billboard, December 27, 1969. pp. 16-17.

MAD Magazine issue No. 137 (September 1970) included a parody titled A Boy Dog Named Lassie, based on the fact that the Lassie movies and TV series employed male Collies in the female title role. The gender-bending implications of the title have been adapted to explore issues of sex and gender, another use of the popular song title that goes beyond its original scope. The 2001 documentary A Boy Named Sue features a transgender protagonist and uses the song in the soundtrack. A Boy Named Sue: Gender and Country Music is the title of a 2004 book about the role of the gender in American country music.Kristine M. McCusker, Diane Pecknold (2004) A Boy Named Sue: Gender and Country Music, University Press of Mississippi, In Winston Groom's 1986 novel Forrest Gump and its 1995 sequel Gump and Co., the title character explores the world with a male ape named Sue, who had been a NASA test animal. The ape is never mentioned in the 1994 Forrest Gump movie. In the film Swingers, one of the male characters is named Sue. The name is explained by another character by saying, "his dad was a big Johnny Cash fan." "A Boy Named Sue" is referenced in the Red Hot Chili Peppers song "Save This Lady." The Stone Temple Pilots' song "Crackerman" references "A Boy Named Sue" in the second verse. Big John Bates did an uptempo cover of the song for a Johnny Cash compilation record in 2009. ==References== Category:Songs about parenthood Category:Shel Silverstein songs Category:1969 singles Category:Live singles Category:Johnny Cash songs Category:Songs written by Shel Silverstein Category:Song recordings produced by Chet Atkins Category:Song recordings produced by Bob Johnston Category:Columbia Records singles Category:RCA Records singles Category:Novelty songs Category:1969 songs

40199202	A Boy Scout Around the World	A Boy Scout Around the World (Danish: Jorden Rundt i 44 dage, literally: Around the World in 44 Days) is a travel description published in October 1928 and written by Danish Boy Scout and later actor Palle Huld at the age of 15, following his travel around the world in spring 1928. His trip was sponsored by a Danish newspaper and made on the occasion of the 100th birthday of Jules Verne, a French author of adventure and science fiction. Palle Huld was chosen after having answered a newspaper advertisement; applicants had to be boys, 15 years old, able to manage in English and German and of good health. Like the characters in Jules Verne’s 1873 novel Around the World in 80 days he was only allowed to travel by land and sea, not by air. The travel (on first class) went from Denmark to Great Britain, across the Atlantic Ocean to Canada. From the American west coast he continued to Japan, China, Soviet Union, Poland, Germany and back to Denmark. He had to travel alone but was helped along the way by reporters of the newspaper, members of Danish embassies and local Boy Scouts. The travel was followed by not only Danish newspapers but newspapers around the world and on his return to Copenhagen he was met by a crowd of 20,000 people. He travelled towards the west, which was the fastest but also the opposite direction of the one taken in Around the World in 80 Days. Unlike the novel, he had little problems in reaching departures. In western Canada he met First Nations, who promised not to take his scalp, though red scalps were at a premium. He was impressed by the luxury of the Pacific Ocean liner; its restaurant was the size of the hall of a castle in his opinion and onboard he could play tennis and water polo. Around the world he was met by the press and he got increasingly better at handling them as the travel progressed. One question that gave him problems was about his taste in women; he told the journalist that he was too young to think of it. He was met with generosity, many accessories for his travel such as shoes and a camera were given to him for free. He declined one offer. On board the Pacific liner he would not let a young American woman darn his socks. Later, when he visited the famous Japanese Admiral Togo, he had to take his shoes off and thereby reveal the holes in his socks, which made him regret not taking the offer. Nevertheless, Japan was his favorite country since he found everything pretty. After his journey he was invited to, among others, Great Britain where he met with Robert Baden-Powell founder of the boy Scout Movement and France where he laid flowers on the grave of Jules Verne. ==Legacy== The book was translated into 11 languages and is said to have inspired Belgian cartoonist Hergé to create the Tintin comics. The theory that Palle Huld should be the inspiration for Tintin goes back to 1988 where it was proposed by Tintin collector Stéphane Steeman in an article titled Les Amis d’Hergé. He found striking resemblances between the pictures of Palle Huld's memoires and Hergé's early drawings of Tintin He was backed by Philippe Goddin, who found it likely that especially Tintin's staged reception at Brussels' north station in the guise of a 15-year-old Belgian Boy Scout, following the 1930 publication of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, was inspired by Palle Huld's reception in Copenhagen. It has not been possible to verify these claims by the papers left by Hergé, and Palle Huld himself had not heard of them when interviewed in 2009 on Tintin's 80 birthday. Palle Huld died in 2010 at the age of 98 years. On what would have been his 100th birthday in 2012 the Danish version was reprinted in his honor. ==Language editions== *Czech: Kolem světa za 44 dni...

41158519	A Boy Was Born	A Boy Was Born, Op. 3, is a choral composition by Benjamin Britten. Subtitled Choral variations for men's, women's and boys' voices, unaccompanied (organ ad lib), it was originally composed from 1932 to 1933. It was first performed on 23 February 1934 as a BBC broadcast. Britten revised the work in 1955. The composer set different texts related to Christmas to music as theme and variations, scored for an a cappella choir with boys' voices. == History and versions == Britten composed A Boy Was Born at age 19 as a student at the Royal College of Music. He wrote it between 25 November 1932 and 11 May 1933. His last project at the college, it is his first major vocal work and his first mature work on religious themes. He dedicated it to his father. The work is in the form of a musical theme and six variations setting ten different texts dating mostly from the 16th century, with one by Christina Rossetti from the 19th century, so forming the first of his "poetic anthology" works.Oliver (1996): p. 39. Variation structures particularly appealed to Britten: even before composing A Boy Was Born, he had started a set of variations for string orchestra which he was later to complete as the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge.Oliver (1996): p. 40. Later he was to compose a set of variations for his Piano Concerto,Oliver (1996): p. 69. and his opera The Turn of the Screw is extensively based on the variation principle. Movement Title Author Theme A boy was born Anon. 16th century Variation 1 Lullay, Jesu Anon. before 1536 Variation 2 Herod Anon. before 1529 Variation 3 Jesu, as Thou art our saviour Anon. 15th century Variation 4 The Three Kings Anon. 15th century Variation 5 In the Bleak Midwinter Christina Rossetti Corpus Christi Carol Anon. before 1536 Variation 6 (Finale) Noel!, Welcome Yule Anon. 16th century Christmas Thomas Tusser A Christmas Carol Francis Quarles A Boy Was Born was first performed on 23 February 1934 in a BBC radio concert of contemporary music. Leslie Woodgate conducted the Wireless Chorus and choirboys of St Mark's, North Audley Street, London. Sir Edward Elgar died the same day. The work takes about 32 minutes to perform. It was among Britten's first compositions to be published, by Chester Music. Britten revised it in 1955.Oliver, Michael. Benjamin Britten. Phaidon, 1996: p. 216. This version was first performed on 22 November 1955 in London at the Grosvenor Chapel, by the Purcell Singers conducted by Imogen Holst. Britten himself conducted a recording with Michael Hartnett (treble), the Purcell Singers, boys' voices of the English Opera Group, and the choir of All Saints. In 1957–58, Ralph Downes added an organ part. In 2013, celebrating Britten's centenary, A Boy Was Born was performed by the BBC Singers and the Temple Church Choir at The Proms, conducted by David Hill. Festivals in Sheffield and Birmingham in 2013, in honour of the centenary of Britten's birth, were named after the composition. == Music == Britten displayed in the elaborate work his skill in composition and the handling of words. He composed six choral variations on the first four notes sung by the sopranos: { \set Score.automaticBars = ##f \key d \major \time 2/2 \relative c' {d2 \bar "|" e2 g2 \bar "|" e2} \addlyrics {A boy was born } } Paul Spicer notes about the key: "Theoretically in D, the work, like most of Britten’s music, is as much modal as diatonic, though his modality bears little relationship to that of the English pastoralists—Vaughan Williams and the rest—who were then at their most influential." He mentions Alban Berg as a composer who influenced Britten's variation techniques such as augmentation and inversion of motifs. The first variation is in the form of a dialogue between Mary (women's voices) and the child (boys). Variation 2 tells of the massacre of the innocents with jerky rhythms, altering and distorting the original theme. In variation 3 a semi-chorus sings the text, "Jesu, as Thou art our saviour", punctuated four times by a boy (or boys) singing "Jesu" as a melisma. Variation 4, about the three kings, has the theme as a wordless background flow to the narrative, picturing a distant procession. Variation 5, set for upper voices only, opens with Rossetti's "In the Bleak Midwinter" sung by women's voices, whose parts 'clashing' in seconds suggest the cold while their descending phrases suggest the falling snow: against this, the boys choir sing an artlessly folk-like setting of the Corpus Christi Carol. Variation 6 is in the form of a lively rondo, one of the most complex to perform as it divides into eight distinct voice parts, followed by a recollection of the earlier variations and final return of the original theme.Milner, Anthony. "The Choral Music": Chapter 29 in The Britten Companion, ed. Christopher Palmer. Faber, 1984: p. 330 The choral writing is demanding. Spicer points out that the boys' choir has to be a separate group but should be positioned not far from the mixed choir because of their intricate relationship. == See also == * "Puer natus in Bethlehem", a medieval Latin Christmas hymn == Notes == == References == == External links == * Listening to Britten – A boy was born, Op.3 goodmorningbritten.wordpress.com, 8 June 2013 Category:Compositions by Benjamin Britten Britten Category:1933 compositions Category:Christmas music

39271639	A Boy and His Atom	A Boy and His Atom is a 2013 stop-motion animated short film released on YouTube by IBM Research. One minute in length, it was made by moving carbon monoxide molecules with a scanning tunneling microscope, a device that magnifies them 100 million times. These two-atom molecules were moved to create images, which were then saved as individual frames to make the film. The movie was recognized by the Guinness Book of World Records as the World's Smallest Stop-Motion Film in 2013. The scientists at IBM Research – Almaden who made the film are moving atoms to explore the limits of data storage because, as data creation and consumption gets bigger, data storage needs to get smaller, all the way down to the atomic level. Traditional silicon transistor technology has become cheaper, denser and more efficient, but fundamental physical limitations suggest that scaling down is an unsustainable path to solving the growing Big Data dilemma. This team of scientists is particularly interested in starting on the smallest scale, single atoms, and building structures up from there. Using this method, IBM announced it can now store a single bit of information in just 12 atoms (current technology takes roughly one million atoms to store a single bit). ==Creation== thumb|right|Diagram of a carbon monoxide molecule|alt=A large black spherical object with a slightly smaller red one merging into it from the right A Boy And His Atom was created by a team of IBM scientists – together with Ogilvy & Mather, IBM's longstanding advertising agency – at the company's Almaden Research Center in San Jose, California. Using a scanning tunneling microscope, Carbon monoxide molecules were manipulated into place on a copper substrate with a copper needle at a distance of 1 nanometer. They remain in place, forming a bond with the substrate because of the extremely low temperature of 5 K (, ) at which the device operates. The oxygen component of each molecule shows up as a dot when photographed by the scanning tunneling microscope, allowing the creation of images composed of many such dots. The team created 242 still images with 65 carbon monoxide molecules. The images were combined to make a stop-motion film. Each frame measures 45 by 25 nanometers. It took four researchers two weeks of 18-hour days to produce the film. The graphics and sound effects resemble those of early video games. "This movie is a fun way to share the atomic-scale world," said project leader Andreas J. Heinrich. "The reason we made this was not to convey a scientific message directly, but to engage with students, to prompt them to ask questions." In addition, the researchers created three still images to promote Star Trek Into Darkness—the Federation logo, the starship Enterprise, and a Vulcan salute. ==Reaction== Guinness World Records certified the movie as The World's Smallest Stop-Motion Film ever made. The film was accepted into the Tribeca Online Film Festival and shown at the New York Tech Meet-up and the World Science Festival. The film surpassed a million views in 24 hours, and two million views in 48 hours, with more than 27,000 likes. As of February 2023, the film has over 22 million views and over 690,000 likes. ==Implications== While the film was used by the researchers as a fun way to get students interested in science, it grew out of work that could increase the amount of data computers could store. In 2012, they demonstrated that they could store a bit of computer memory on a group of just 12 atoms instead of a million, the previous minimum. If it became commercially viable, "You could carry around, not just two movies on your iPhone," Heinrich said in a companion video about the film's production, "you could carry around every movie ever produced."Moving Atoms, at 2:55. ==See also== * Teeny Ted from Turnip Town, the "world's smallest book" which requires an electron microscope to be read ==References== ==External links== * * * *IBM researchers make world's smallest movie using atoms (w/ video) at Phys.org Category:2013 animated films Category:2010s animated short films Category:2013 films Category:Experiments Category:IBM Category:Individual physical objects Category:Nanotechnology Category:Scanning probe microscopy Category:2010s English-language films
21833180	A Boy and His Blob	A Boy and His Blob is a puzzle-platform game developed by WayForward Technologies and published by Majesco Entertainment. It is a re-imagining of the 1989 video game, A Boy and His Blob: Trouble on Blobolonia, which was originally developed by Imagineering for the NES. The game was released for the Wii in North America on October 13 and in Europe on November 6, 2009. A high-definition port of the game developed by Abstraction Games was released on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux on January 20, 2016. A PlayStation 3 version was made available on June 28 of the same year as a cross-purchase with the PS4 and Vita versions. Mobile ports for iOS and Android were later released worldwide on November 17 and September 26 of 2017 respectively. A Nintendo Switch version was released on November 4, 2021 by WayForward and Ziggurat Interactive. WayForward's director Sean Velasco, a fan of the original NES title, expressed a desire to re-create and update the experience for current generation gamers, streamlining the NES title's gameplay mechanics to create a more "forgiving" experience. A Boy and His Blob's art direction has received widespread critical acclaim and praise, and was utilized by the developers, in addition to a minimalistic story, in order to create a "heartwarming... and friendly game" accessible to a wide audience. ==Gameplay== left|thumb|alt=In-game screenshot of the Boy using the Blob as a parachute. The two are hovering over a ledge in a forested area with a large sign beneath them indicating the player should use the parachute transformation.|The "blob" is capable of a number of transformations in order to traverse the game's puzzles, such as a parachute to avoid damage from falls. A Boy and His Blob is a 2D side-scrolling puzzle platformer in which players control a young boy as he cooperates with a blob-like creature to overcome various obstacles. The boy can feed the blob a variety of jelly beans, which are unlocked as the game progresses and vary depending on the level, which transforms it into one of fifteen different objects that can be used to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. These include ladders for climbing, anvils to drop on top of enemies, holes that allow the boy to drop through platforms, and cannons for shooting to the difficult-to-reach areas. Unlike the original NES game, which only displayed each jelly bean's flavor, this version allows players to select beans from a wheel that shows what each bean does. The boy can also hug and scold the blob, as well as call to it to revert its transformation and bring it to his side. However, the boy will die if he touches an enemy or a hazardous object, or falls from a great height, sending the player back to the beginning of the area. The game is split into four worlds, each containing ten levels and a boss battle. Finding three chests hidden within each main level unlocks additional challenge levels, which reward bonus developer material such as concept art and storyboards when cleared. ==Plot== The planet Blobolonia is threatened by an evil emperor, and the titular "blob" flees to Earth seeking help. It crash-lands on Earth and finds the eponymous "boy". They team up in order to dethrone the evil emperor, first by completing a quest on Earth and then by traveling to Blobolonia.A Boy and His Blob (2009-10-13). Majesco Entertainment. Retrieved 2009-10-16. Along the way, minions of the Emperor attempt to stop them. ==Development== WayForward's director Sean Velasco, a fan of the original NES title, felt the series "had a ton of potential" and was "a title whose time had come to be re- imagined". He felt the title would be a natural fit for WayForward's signature proprietary animation and 2D visuals. The rights to the series originally belonged to Absolute Entertainment, but Majesco Entertainment was able to acquire the rights after Absolute went bankrupt in 1995. WayForward, already having a positive working relationship with Majesco, pitched the "idea of [creating] a very heartwarming Boy and Blob, and having a very friendly game" that both improved upon the usability of the original title and featured 2D hand-drawn animation "reminiscent of animated movies from the '80s". The designer of the NES title and co-founder of Activision, David Crane, was not involved with the Wii title, but the new developers expressed respect for both him and his work when creating the new title. In terms of faithfulness to the original NES title, producer Robb Alvey explained that "(it's about) the original spirit of the game and creating something for this generation of gamers. If you're familiar with the original game, you'll recognize immediately the homage we pay to its origin. And if you've never played the original, it's not going to feel like anything 'retro'". Sean Velasco similarly expressed that the game is a "re-imagining" of the original title instead of a direct sequel or remake. Some changes made to the gameplay include frequent save checkpoints and unlimited jelly beans. Marc Gomez, as art director, was responsible for most of the game's signature look and feel. He wanted to do something very soft, inspired by the works of filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki. The decision to make the boy "much younger and rounder" than his NES counterpart was also Marc's, as was the idea of making the blob "a more faithful companion (similar to) a dog". With the new, younger design for the boy and the blob, Marc "wanted them to have (a) mutual need for each other... One can't progress without the other". Overall, the game has around 4,000 unique frames of animation. In terms of the game's controls, Sean Velasco wanted something "very intuitive for the family crowd" and wanted to "avoid anything that doesn't directly serve the game itself" such as, "waggle controls simply for the sake of waggle". The "hug" button is a vestigial feature of a more fleshed out emotion system abandoned during development. Managing the blob's emotions and keeping him happy throughout the game proved too much of a hassle during testing, so the mechanics were largely thrown out. Sean Velasco felt the in-game hug was "too heart-melting to ignore", so it was kept.Five Questions with Sean Velasco Lead Designer of A Boy and His Blob. Game Informer. Iss 199. Nov 2009. p.47. Velasco remarked that its simplicity allowed them to create a "very heartwarming...and friendly game" and to really highlight a "major component of the game, which is the friendship between the boy and blob". Gomez explained that "everything is about subtlety. There will be hints here and there letting you in on what is taking place. The story will develop as much as the player wants to venture in the details". ==Reception== Reception for A Boy and His Blob has been largely positive, with many reviewers commenting on the game's art design and faithfulness to the feel of the NES original. Nintendo Power called it "a super magical adventure full of mesmerizing sights and compelling gameplay" and praised that the game "can be enjoyed on multiple levels and by players of all ages", giving it a score of 8.5/10.A Boy and His Blob Review. Nintendo Power. Nov 2009. p.85. IGN praised the game's art direction, yet criticized the control scheme and "die-and-retry nature of the level designs", awarding the game a 7.6/10. GameTrailers likewise questioned aspects of the control scheme, but praised the game's puzzles and overall feel, giving the game a total score of 8.5/10. Game Informer awarded the game an 8.0/10 (with a "second opinion" score of 8.75/10) calling the game "a stylish rebirth [of] the NES cult classic" and praising the game's learning curve, atmosphere, and nostalgia factor. Similar to other reviews they faulted the game's "twitchy controls". Joystiq noted that A Boy and His Blob was a "really good example of how to update a classic; the game feels new, yet retains what fans love about the original experience", yet expressed frustration at the game's need to "hold [your] hand" at times by providing "hints" to a puzzle's solution in the form of overabundant signs. They noted, however, that this feature may be appreciated by younger children and casual gamers. 1UP.com gave A Boy and His Blob a B+, noting occasional problems with the blob's AI and some shortcomings in terms of the game's secondary animation, but praising the game's more "forgiving" gameplay when compared to the NES A Boy and His Blob and calling the art "gorgeous". G4TV called the game "the kind of game the Wii was designed for". ==References== Category:2009 video games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:IOS games Category:Linux games Category:MacOS games Category:Majesco Entertainment games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:Puzzle-platform games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation Vita games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video games about children Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set on fictional planets Category:Video game remakes Category:Wii games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:WayForward games Category:Ziggurat Interactive games
200010	A Boy and His Dog	thumb|Cover of Vic and Blood #2 A Boy and His Dog is a cycle of narratives by author Harlan Ellison. The cycle tells the story of an amoral boy (Vic) and his telepathic dog (Blood), who work together as a team to survive in the post-apocalyptic world after a nuclear war. The original 1969 novella was adapted into the 1975 film A Boy and His Dog directed by L.Q. Jones. Both the story and the film were well-received by critics and science fiction fans, but the film was not successful commercially. The original novella was followed by short stories and a graphic novel. The film adaptation was an influence on Love and Monsters (2020) by Michael Matthews. The story and its film adaptation have also been mentioned to be influential in the creation of the Fallout video game series by Black Isle Studios. ==Publication history== Ellison began the cycle with the 1969 short story of the same title, published in New Worlds, and expanded and revised the tale to novella length for his story collection The Beast that Shouted Love at the Heart of the World the same year. He subsequently bookended the original story with two others in the same world: "Eggsucker" (The Ariel Book of Fantasy Volume Two, 1977), and "Run, Spot, Run" (Amazing Stories, 1980). The stories were adapted as a two- issue black and white comic series illustrated by Richard Corben, Vic and Blood: The Chronicles of a Boy and His Dog (Mad Dog Graphics, 1987). The series was collected as a color graphic novel of the same name in 1989 by NBM/St. Martin’s Press, and was in turn published in French by Comics USA (Vic & Blood: Les chroniques d'un gars at son chien, 1989) and in Spanish by Norma Editorial (Vic & Blood, CEC #72, 1990). Both the graphic novel and the prose stories were collected in Vic and Blood: The Continuing Adventures of a Boy and His Dog (Edgework Abbey/iBooks, 2003). Ellison's introduction to the collection explains that 1969's A Boy and His Dog is part of a larger novel that he has been writing for over 30 years and that story is finished, but the last, longest part is written as a screenplay with no current plans for production. Ellison suggested as late as 2003 that he would combine the three stories (possibly with additional material) to create a novel with the proposed title of Blood's a Rover (not to be confused with the Chad Oliver story or the James Ellroy novel Blood's a Rover). In January 2018, Subterranean Press announced the publication of Blood's a Rover, combining materials from the author's files, versions of the novella and short stories that have been expanded and revised, material from Corben's graphic novel, and previously unpublished material from the unproduced 1977 NBC television series Blood's a Rover. ==Setting== The novella and the film adaptation have the same alternate timeline setting, diverging with the failed assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Instead of concentrating on the Space Race, technological advancements in robotics, animal intelligence, and telepathy take place. A more heated Cold War takes place, culminating in a conventional World War III. A truce is signed, lasting another 25 years, though mounting tensions lead to World War IV in 2007, this time involving massive nuclear warfare and only lasting five days. Civilization is almost entirely obliterated, leaving the surface of Earth reduced to a desolate, irradiated wasteland. Years later, in 2024, foragers who remain above ground must fight for the remaining resources. Most survivors in the former United States are male, as women were usually in the bombed cities while many men were out fighting in the war. In the novella, nuclear fallout had created horrific mutations, such as the feared burnpit screamers, known for their noise and deadliness (in the film, they appear in only one scene, though they are only heard). ==Eggsucker== ===Plot=== Blood recalls how he met Vic in 2048, and describes him as "steadfast, responsible, and game as they come." He recounts an evening during which he and Vic go to barter scavenged items with the "82nd Airborne", the armorers for most of the local roverpacks except for that of the child-slaver "Fellini." Transported from a dock by skiff to the 82nd Airborne's boat, the pair trade wine and spent brass for fresh ammunition, and Vic is invited to stay and drink. Blood declines to drink, and is repeatedly insulted by the gang, until the goading drives him to attempt to bite one of them. The gang member knocks Blood down and points a rifle at Blood's head, and Vic immediately shoots the gang member. As Vic covers the remaining stunned gang members, Blood climbs into Vic's pack and passes out. He awakens again with them on the dock and Vic running for their lives. Upon reaching safety, Vic unceremoniously dumps Blood onto the ground and storms off in anger at having lost access to "the only armorer in the territory." Blood initially lets him go, but thinks better of it after considering the alternatives, and saves Vic from walking into a crater in the road containing a "Screamer" (a green corpse-like mutant). The pair run miles up the road, and having reconciled, sit down to eat. ==A Boy and His Dog== ===Plot=== Vic, aged 15, was born in and scavenges throughout the wasteland of the former southwestern United States as a "solo" (as opposed to a member of a "roverpack" gang). Vic is most concerned with food and sex. Having lost both of his parents, he has no formal education and does not understand ethics or morality. He is accompanied by a well-read, misanthropic, telepathic dog named Blood, who helps him locate women, in return for food. Blood cannot forage for himself, due to the same genetic engineering that granted him telepathy. The two steal for a living, evading "roverpacks" (gangs) and mutants. Blood and Vic have an occasionally antagonistic relationship, though they realize that they need each other. At a movie house, Blood claims to smell a woman, and the pair track her to an abandoned YMCA building. There, they meet Quilla June Holmes, a teenaged girl from "Downunder", a society located in a large underground nuclear vault. Before Vic can rape her, Blood informs the pair that a roverpack has tracked them to the building and they have to fight them off. After killing a number of them, the trio hides in a boiler and set the structure on fire. Vic finally has sex with Quilla June, and though she protests at first, she begins to come on to him. Blood takes an instant disliking to her, but Vic ignores him. Vic and Quilla June have sex repeatedly but eventually she attacks him and takes off to return to her underground community. Vic, furious at her deception, follows her, despite Blood's warnings. Blood remains at the portal on the surface. Downunder has an artificial biosphere complete with forests and underground cities. One, named Topeka after the ruins of the city it lies beneath, is fashioned in a surreal mockery of 1950s rural innocence. Vic is captured by the ruling council (the Better Business Bureau). They confess that Quilla June was sent to the surface in order to lure a man to Downunder. The population of Topeka is becoming sterile, and the babies that are born are usually female. They feel that Vic, despite his crudeness and savage behavior, will be able to reinvigorate that male population. Vic is first elated to learn that he is to impregnate the female population, but he quickly grows jaded of his surroundings and plots his escape. Quilla June is reunited with Vic and they plan to escape together. Vic uses the fact that Quilla June's father secretly desires sex with her as a distraction, incapacitating him so that they can escape. On the surface, Vic and Quilla June discover that Blood is starving and near death, having been attacked by radioactive insects and other "things". Quilla June tries to get Vic to leave Blood and take off with her. Knowing he will never survive without Blood's guidance and, more importantly, that Blood will not survive without care and food, Vic faces a difficult situation. It is implied that he kills his new love and cooks her flesh to save Blood's life. The novella ends with Vic remembering her question as Blood eats: "Do you know what love is?" and he concludes, "Sure I know. A boy loves his dog." ===Reception=== The novella won the Nebula Award for Best Novella upon its release in 1969 and was also nominated for the 1970 Hugo Award for Best Novella. ===Film adaptation=== The 1975 science fiction film directed by L.Q. Jones was controversial for alleged misogyny; the script included lines that were not in Ellison's original stories and that authors such as Joanna Russ found to be objectionable. The film's final line is from Blood: "Well, I'd say she certainly had marvelous judgement, Albert, if not particularly good taste." Ellison disavowed this addition as a "moronic, hateful chauvinist last line, which I despise." Ellison did, however, accept that the ending remained popular with fans, saying: "I would have kept the original last line from the original story, which I think is much more human and beguiling than the sort of punchline that L.Q. Jones used. But L.Q. knew what he was doing in terms of the market, I suppose." On the other hand, Harlan also loved the movie (as stated in an interview conversation with L.Q. Jones on the Shout Factory Blu Ray); after Jones screened it to him, he said it was exactly what the story was supposed to be on screen. It was a few days after he brought up his problems, mostly concerning the way Blood talked about the girl during the locker room scene when they first meet. ==Run, Spot, Run== ===Plot=== Although Blood is now back on his feet and travelling west, the pair's situation deteriorates as the guilt-ridden Vic begins having hallucinations of a ghostly Quilla June, which Blood also experiences through their telepathic link. Due to his preoccupation, Vic stumbles into an encounter with a roving gang of child soldiers and slaves led by the adult "Fellini", and badly breaks his ankle while attempting to escape. At Blood's suggestion, Vic climbs into a hollow tree stump to hide, and Blood covers him with leaves and dirt before going to hide himself. Hours later, with the gang gone, Blood returns to find the stump surrounded by giant spiders. Driving them off, Blood finds Vic in a hopeless, almost catatonic state, and despite Blood's appeals, Vic allows himself to be cocooned by one of the spiders. Blood runs off as the spider finishes and begins to look for new prey, and he continues west, now haunted by the ghost of Vic rather than Quilla June. ===Production=== The reasons given by Ellison for this abrupt ending have differed over the years. One relates to his anger over the L.Q. Jones ending of the film, as detailed above. The other is, according to Ellison, essentially a desire to stop his fans from requesting more stories about the two characters. Ellison claimed at the time of the film's release that he had said all he wanted to say about Vic and Blood, and that there would be no more sequels. ===Blood's A Rover=== A publication of a sequel novel, Blood's A Rover, was announced by Ace Books in the early 1980s; while Ellison spent the advance, he never delivered a manuscript, and the publication was canceled (Ace agreed to settle for republishing 13 of Ellison's books. In the introduction to Vic and Blood, dated 25 March 2003, Ellison claimed to have finished it, but that "the final, longest section is in screenplay form—and they're bidding here in Hollywood, once again, for the feature film and tv rights—and one of these days before I go through that final door, I'll translate it into elegant prose, and the full novel will appear" ==References== Category:1969 short stories Category:Alternate history short stories Category:Cannibalism in fiction Category:Cold War fiction Category:Fiction about telepathy Category:Fiction set in 2024 Category:Nebula Award for Best Novella-winning works Category:Novels set during World War III Category:Fiction about nuclear war and weapons Category:American post-apocalyptic fiction Category:Short stories by Harlan Ellison Category:Short stories set in the United States
17488265	A Boy and His Dog (1946 film)	A Boy and His Dog is a 1946 American Technicolor short drama film directed by LeRoy Prinz. It won an Oscar at the 19th Academy Awards in 1947 for Best Short Subject (Two-Reel). Short-story author Samuel A. Derieux, who died twenty-four years earlier in 1922, received story credit for the film, suggesting to some the expectation that he wrote a work with the title "A Boy and His Dog"."Samuel Arthur Derieux ... was the author of: ...

41649549	A Boy and His Dog (1975 film)	A Boy and His Dog is a 1975 American black comedy science fiction film directed by actor L.Q. Jones, from a screenplay by Jones based on the 1969 novella of the same title by fantasy author Harlan Ellison. The film stars Don Johnson, Susanne Benton, Alvy Moore, and Jason Robards. It was independently produced and distributed by Jones' company LQ/Jaf Productions. The film's storyline concerns a teenage boy, Vic, and his telepathic dog, Blood, who work together as a team in order to survive in the dangerous post-apocalyptic wasteland of the Southwestern United States. Shout! Factory released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in August 2013. ==Plot== In the post-nuclear war America of 2024, Vic (Don Johnson) is an 18-year-old boy, born in and scavenging throughout the wasteland of the former southwestern United States. Vic is most concerned with food and sex; having lost his parents, he has no formal education and does not understand ethics or morality. He is accompanied by a well-read, misanthropic, telepathic dog named Blood, who helps him find women to rape, in exchange for which Vic finds food for the dog. Blood cannot forage for himself due to the same genetic engineering that granted him telepathy. The two steal for a living, evading bands of raiders, berserk military androids, and mutants. Blood and Vic have an occasionally antagonistic relationship (Blood frequently annoys Vic by calling him "Albert" for reasons never made clear), though they realize that they need each other to survive. Blood wishes to find the legendary promised land of "Over the Hill" where above-ground utopias are said to exist, though Vic believes that they must make the best of what they have. Searching a bunker for a woman for Vic to rape, they find one, but she has already been severely mutilated and is on the verge of death. Vic displays no pity. He is merely angered by the "wastefulness" of such an act, as well as disgusted by the thought of satisfying his urges with a woman in such a condition. They move on, only to find slavers excavating another bunker. Vic steals several cans of their food, later using them to barter for goods in a nearby shanty town. That evening, while watching old vintage stag films at a local outdoor "cinema", Blood claims to smell a woman, and the pair track her to a large underground warehouse. There, Vic attempts to rape Quilla June Holmes (Susanne Benton), a scheming and seductive teenage girl from Downunder, a society in a large underground settlement. Unknown to the pair, Quilla June's father, Lou Craddock (Jason Robards), had sent her above ground to "recruit" surface dwellers. Blood takes an instant dislike to her, but Vic ignores him. After Vic saves Quilla June from raiders and mutants, they have repeated sex. Eventually, she secretly returns to her underground society. Enticed by the thought of more women and sex, Vic follows her, despite Blood's warnings. Blood remains on the surface at Downunder's portal. Downunder has an artificial biosphere, complete with forests and a city, which is named Topeka after the ruins of the destroyed city that it lies beneath. The city is ruled by a triumvirate known as the Committee, who have shaped Topeka into a bizarre caricature of pre-nuclear war America, with all residents wearing whiteface and clothes evocative of rural United States prior to World War II. When Vic is told that he has been brought to Topeka to help fertilize the female population, he is elated to learn of his "stud" value. His joy is short-lived, when he is informed that Topeka meets its need for exogamous reproduction by electroejaculation and artificial insemination, which will deny him the sexual pleasure that he had envisioned. People who refuse to comply with the Committee are sent off to "the farm" and never seen again, as they are violently killed. Vic is informed that when his semen has been used to impregnate 35 women, he will also be sent to "the farm". Quilla June helps Vic escape only because she wants him to kill the Committee members and destroy their android enforcer, Michael (Hal Baylor), so that she can usurp their power. Vic has no interest in politics or remaining underground. He only wants to return to Blood and the wasteland. The rebellion is quashed by Michael, who crushes the heads of Quilla June's co-conspirators before Vic disables him. She proclaims her "love" for Vic and wants to escape to the surface with him—now that her rebellion has been quashed, and the Committee has decreed that she will be sent to the farm. On the surface, Vic and Quilla June discover that Blood is starving and near death. She pleads with Vic to abandon Blood, forcing him to face his true feelings. Vic decides that his loyalties lie with his dog. Off-camera, Vic murders Quilla June and cooks her flesh so that Blood can eat and survive. Blood thanks Vic for the food, and they both comment on Quilla June. Vic says that it was her fault that she followed him, while Blood wryly jokes that she had marvelous judgment but did not have particularly good "taste". The boy and his dog continue to talk as they walk off together into the wasteland. ==Cast== * Don Johnson as Vic * Tim McIntire as "Blood" (voice) * Susanne Benton as Quilla June Holmes * Jason Robards as Lou Craddock * Alvy Moore as Dr. Moore * Helene Winston as "Mez" Smith * Charles McGraw as Preacher * Hal Baylor as Michael * Ron Feinberg as Fellini * Michael Rupert as Gery * Don Carter as Ken * Michael Hershman as Richard * L.Q. Jones as Actor In Porno Film ==Production== Harlan Ellison wrote the original novella A Boy and His Dog and began an adaptation for film. However, after encountering writer's block, actor/director L.Q. Jones came onboard to write the script. Jones' own company, LQ/Jaf Productions (L.Q. Jones & Friends), independently produced the film. Distributors initially were reluctant to finance the production, so Jones raised $400,000 through family and business associates. The film was shot at Pacific Ocean Park in Venice, California, and on location around Barstow, California and Coyote Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert. In an interview, Harlan Ellison said: "When he [Blood] calls Vic 'Al' or 'Albert', he is referring to the Albert Payson Terhune dog stories, whereas a traditional boy and his dog relationship is turned upside down in this movie." James Cagney's voice was considered as the voice of Blood, but was dropped because it would have been too recognizable and prove to be a distraction. Eventually, after going through approximately 600 auditions, they settled on Tim McIntire, a veteran voice actor who also did most of the music for the film. Ray Manzarek (misspelled in the film credits as "Manzarec"), formerly of The Doors, was also among those credited for the score. McIntire sang the main theme. Bolivian composer Jaime Mendoza-Nava provided the music for the Topeka underground segment. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 78% approval rating based on 36 reviews, with an average rating of 6.6/10. The site's consensus states: "An offbeat, eccentric black comedy, A Boy and His Dog features strong dialogue and an oddball vision of the future". On Metacritic the film has a score of 68% based on reviews from 10 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film 2.5 stars out of a possible 4, writing that Ellison's novella "seemed almost to defy filming" but nonetheless Jones managed to offer "a sort of wacky success". Richard Eder of The New York Times wrote that the realistic world set up in the beginning and the underground community introduced later "don't really work together; their contrast, and a ridiculous ending, shatter the picture. And the talking dog chews up the pieces".Eder, Richard (June 17, 1976). "Film: 'Boy and His Dog'". The New York Times. 32. Variety called the film "a turkey" and "an amateurish blend of redneck humor, chaotic fight scenes, and dimwitted philosophizing"."Film Reviews: A Boy And His Dog". Variety. March 26, 1975. 32. Gene Siskel of the Chicago Tribune gave the film 1.5 stars out of 4 and wrote: "Rather than illuminate the present through a glance at a possible future, 'A Boy and His Dog' is simply a dim-witted collection of tired sex gags and anti-American imagery".Siskel, Gene (March 30, 1976). "'Boy and Dog' runs tired". Chicago Tribune. Section 3, p. 3. Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times praised the film as "an offbeat delight" with performances that "have that comfortable naturalness often detectable when an actor is directing other actors".Champlin, Charles (October 10, 1975). "After the Dust Has Settled". Los Angeles Times. Part IV, p. 1. Gary Arnold of The Washington Post panned the film as a "shoddy, puerile science-fiction parable" that "mistakes juvenile facetiousness for wit and glorifies a juvenile concept of freedom, which means making it in the wild, away from such unmanly encumbrances as civilization and girls".Arnold, Gary (July 14, 1975). "'Boy and His Dog' Trying to Survive". The Washington Post. B6. The film was not commercially successful at its release. It has since become a cult film and also inspired the video game series Fallout "on many levels, from underground communities of survivors to glowing mutants", according to Jesse Heining, a developer of the game. On the film's DVD audio commentary, Jones states that Ellison was generally pleased with the film, with the exception of some lines of dialogue. Ellison particularly objected to the film's final line, which did not originate from his original short story, in which Blood said of Quilla, "Well, I'd say she certainly had marvelous judgement, Albert, if not particularly good taste". Ellison referred to it as a "moronic, hateful chauvinist last line, which I despise".Ellison, Harlan; Corben, Richard. Vic and Blood. Simon & Schuster. 2003. pp. 5–6. The 1975 science fiction film directed by L.Q. Jones was controversial for alleged misogyny; the script included lines that were not in Ellison's original stories and that authors such as Joanna Russ, in her essay "A Boy and his Dog: The final solution," found to be objectionable. Ellison did, however, accept that the ending remained popular with fans, saying: "I would have kept the original last line from the original story, which I think is much more human and beguiling than the sort of punchline that L.Q. Jones used. But L.Q. knew what he was doing in terms of the market, I suppose." On the other hand, Harlan also loved the movie (as stated in an interview conversation with L.Q. Jones on the Shout Factory Blu Ray); after Jones screened it to him, he said it was exactly what the story was supposed to be on screen. It was a few days after he brought up his problems, mostly concerning the way Blood talked about the girl during the locker room scene when they first meet. ==Accolades== The film won the 1976 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation at MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention in Kansas City, Missouri, located not far from the real Topeka, Kansas. Johnson won the Golden Scroll for Best Actor, which was shared with James Caan for his performance in Rollerball. In 2007, it ranked #96 on Rotten Tomatoes' "Journey Through Sci-Fi" (100 best-reviewed science fiction films)."RT's Journey Through Sci-Fi" , Rotten Tomatoes, 2007. ==Legacy== According to L.Q. Jones, George Miller cited the 1975 film adaptation of A Boy and His Dog as an influence on the Mad Max films, particularly The Road Warrior (1981). ===Sequel=== There were rumors regarding a sequel, but it never materialized. On the film's DVD audio commentary, L.Q. Jones states that he had started to write a script sequel to the film that would have picked up where the first film ended and featured a female warrior named Spike, and we would have seen this world through the eyes of a female instead of a male (this happens in Ellison's story, Blood's a Rover, when Blood partners with Spike after the ostensible death of Vic). Jones and Ellison reportedly collaborated on this short-lived effort, although Ellison said that such 'collaboration' never went beyond a short "what if?" conversation, and that any efforts were solely that of Jones. According to Cult Movies 2, Jones had a sequel planned called A Girl and Her Dog, but the plan was scrapped when Tiger, the dog who portrayed Blood, died. In a December 2003 interview, Jones claimed that he had been repeatedly approached to make a sequel, but funding was always an issue. In 2018, Ellison's teleplay featuring Spike — the girl in the proposed A Girl and Her Dog film — was finally published. Blood's a Rover by Harlan Ellison (Subterranean Press 2018), a "fix-up" novel, consisting of "Eggsucker" and "Run Spot, Run", two short stories from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as "A Boy and His Dog" (Ellison's novella) and an unproduced teleplay from the 1970s, "Blood's a Rover", was published in a limited number of hardcovers. ==See also== * List of American films of 1975 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1970s American films Category:1970s English-language films Category:1970s comedy thriller films Category:1970s science fiction comedy films Category:1970s teen films Category:1975 comedy films Category:1975 films Category:1975 independent films Category:Adaptations of works by Harlan Ellison Category:American comedy thriller films Category:American dystopian films Category:American independent films Category:American post-apocalyptic films Category:American science fiction comedy films Category:American science fiction thriller films Category:American survival films Category:Films about cannibalism Category:Films about dogs Category:Films about nuclear war and weapons Category:Films about rape Category:Films based on science fiction short stories Category:Films based on short fiction Category:Films set in 2024 Category:Films set in deserts Category:Films set in Phoenix, Arizona Category:Films set in the future Category:Films shot in the Mojave Desert Category:Films shot in Ventura County, California Category:First Run Features films Category:Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation winning works

53349884	A Boy and a Girl with a Cat and an Eel	A Boy and a Girl with a Cat and an Eel is a 1635 oil painting by Judith Leyster that is now in the National Gallery, London. ==Academic interpretation== There have been various interpretations of Judith Leyster's A Boy and a Girl with a Cat and an Eel by different scholars. Some, such as Neil McLaren, have argued that it represents the Dutch proverb "Een aal bij de staart hebben" (or "to hold an eel by the tail") meaning that you do not get to hold onto something just because you have it.McLaren 1960, p.219; Maclaren and Brown 1991, p.227 This moralistic interpretation is supported, Cynthia Kortenhorst-Von Bogendorff Rupprath says, by the eye contact with the viewer made by the little girl in the painting as she wags her finger. Other interpretations include allusions to other Dutch proverbs as well as the popular pastime in seventeenth-century Dutch festivals or kermis of katknuppelen, the bludgeoning of cats. The depiction of children torturing or being scratched by cats was a popular one at this time in the Netherlands, and may allude to the Dutch proverbs "Hij doet kattekwaad", which translates literally to "he does the mischief of the cat", or "'t Liep uit op katjesspel", the literal translation of which is "it ends in the game of the cat", which relate to mischievous or arguing children. Leyster's husband, Jan Miense Molenaer, included such an image in his group portrait "The Ruychaver- van der Laen Family" (c. 1629–30) in which a boy holding a clawing cat by the tail torments a girl by dangling it near her; she shies away tending to her scratched hand. These roles are reversed in Leyster's painting where it is the girl pulling the cat's tail, tragedy has not yet struck, and the girl's eye contact and shaking finger leave it perhaps up to the viewer to interpret what result her actions will have. Some scholars have also interpreted the eel being held as a kat aal or cat-eel, which were fed to cats as they were not worth eating. In this case it would be the boy who had enticed the cat into his grasp and he would be getting what was coming to him. Yet another interpretation is that the girl is waving her finger to make the viewers feel that she is reprimanding her brother for teasing the cat, and she is thereby distracting their attention from her own misbehaviour, which is pulling the cat's tail, making it nervous, and about to scratch. There are other examples of Dutch paintings as well as poems, such as Jacob Cats in his introductory section of his book Kinderspel or Children's Games, which use children as a motif both to mock and to preach morals to adults, and Frima Fox Hofrichter says this painting falls into that category. ==See also== * List of paintings by Judith Leyster ==References== Category:Oil paintings Category:Paintings by Judith Leyster Category:Cats in art Category:Paintings of children Category:Fish in art Category:Collections of the National Gallery, London
58622515	A Boy and a Priest	"A Boy and a Priest" is the second episode of the twenty-second season of the American animated television series South Park. The 289th overall episode of the series, it aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 3, 2018. The episode references the Catholic Church sexual abuse cases, which were previously addressed in "Red Hot Catholic Love". ==Plot== As the families of South Park gather at church on Sunday, Stan Marsh questions why he has to attend every week. His parents, Randy and Sharon, admonish him on the ritual's importance, and say that they always feel better after each service. At church, Father Maxi struggles to deliver his sermon amid all the constant interruptions by members of the congregation who make jokes referencing Catholic Church sexual abuse cases. Butters Stotch attempts to console Maxi, relating to him how he had been the subject of ridicule at school, but now enjoys greater popularity. Encouraging him not to give his tormentors the satisfaction of cowering in shame, he invites Maxi to board game night with his friends at Stan's house, but Maxi's appearance there garners more ridicule from Randy, who finds the scene of a Catholic priest sitting with five boys worthy of a photograph on social media. When an embarrassed Maxi leaves, Butters goes after him. Saying that he himself was once like Father Maxi, Butters implores him not to allow himself to be daunted by the cruelty of others, and to simply be himself. As a result of this, Maxi spends more time socializing with Butters, and neglects his duties, to the point that churchgoers find the church doors locked the following Sunday. When Mr. Mackey alerts the Denver Archdiocese that "another" priest has disappeared from his parish, the diocese sends a cleanup crew of ordained church officials to thoroughly clean the South Park church, Stan's house, and any other location where Father Maxi has been, in order to remove trace evidence of child molestation, in particular semen. At Clyde Donovan's birthday party at a roller rink, Butters brings Maxi, much to the anger of Clyde, who does not want a priest at his party. A demoralized Maxi leaves with Butters, and later confesses to him that some time ago, he learned the extent of the Catholic Church sex abuse problem, and that it was worse than anyone thought (as seen in the episode "Red Hot Catholic Love"). When the cleanup crew appear at the roller rink and learn that Maxi was there with Butters, they kidnap Stan and Clyde, and after tracking Butters down, they kidnap him as well. The cleanup crew take the three boys into the woods, where they have deployed a Zamboni ice resurfacer modified to clean up semen, or "Kumboni". Father Maxi tracks down and confronts the cleanup crew, telling them to do whatever they want to him, but to spare the children. Surprised, the bishop in charge says that they are not there to kill him, but to cover up his crimes and issue him a transfer to the Maldives, just as the Church has always done with priests accused of child molestation. When they assure him that other priests will take over for him in South Park, Father Maxi uses the Kumboni to trample the cleanup crew to death. He returns to his position at South Park's church, delivering his sermons and calmly enduring the continued jokes at the expense of the Church. The credits of the episode have slight opaque text in the background reading "#cancelsouthpark" ==Reception== Jesse Schedeen with IGN rated the episode an 8.2 out of 10, summarizing in his review "This week's South Park offered a better sense of how the new season will set itself apart. The idea of looking back a decade or more to revisit classic South Park episodes is definitely appealing, and hopefully this won't be the last time we see that approach in Season 22." John Hugar with The A.V. Club rated the episode a B+ and ended his review stating, "This episode isn't an all-time classic like 'Red Hot Catholic Love,' but much like last week's episode, it handled a dark, difficult topic with the appropriate mix of irreverence and empathy. Trey and Matt are clearly embracing their role as social commentators, and so far, the results have been thoroughly rewarding." The episode was denounced by The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights. However, the criticism was not for casting the Catholic Church in a negative light, but for portraying the Catholic priests accused of misconduct as molesting younger children instead of adolescents. ==References== ==External links== * "Episode 2202 'The Boys Are Missing' Press Release".

5481481	A Boy in France	“A Boy in France” is an uncollected work of short fiction by J. D. Salinger which appeared in the 31 March, 1945 issue of The Saturday Evening Post .Wenke, 1991 p. 167: Selected BibliographySlawenski, 2010 p. 126 The story is the second part of a trio of stories following the character Babe Gladwaller. The first story is "Last Day of the Last Furlough", and the third is "The Stranger". "A Boy in France" is one of the few Salinger war stories which deals directly with combat conditions. The setting is at the front, as Babe, hunkered down in a foxhole, tries to comfort himself by rereading a letter from his sister. The bond between Babe and Matilda anticipates the relationship between Holden Caulfield and his younger sister Phoebe in Salinger's later novel The Catcher in the Rye.Slawenski, 2010 p. 116-119: Plot summary ==Publication== First submitted in 1944 as "What Babe Saw, or Ooh-La- La!", the story was then reworked and first published in The Saturday Evening Post, March 31, 1945. It subsequently appeared in the 1946 collection Post Stories 1942–45, edited by Ben Hibbs. The Saturday Evening Post republished the story in its July/August 2010 issue as a memorial to Salinger. There is some doubt that such a republication would have been possible were Salinger still alive. ==Plot summary== The protagonist of the story is Babe Gadwaller, identified only as “a boy in France” until the end of the piece. The story starts with Babe finishing his canned army rations. He makes small talk with a comrade and looks for a fox hole to rest in. He silently prays that he will not be hit for not digging his own trench, but he is in too much discomfort to dig one himself. He finds a "kraut hole" with a bloody blanket still there. He settles into the hole and tries to get comfortable in the confined space. When he is bitten by a red ant he tries to slap the offending insect and is painfully reminded of a fingernail he lost earlier in the day. He then plays a childish mindgame, imagining his finger healed, his body clean and well- clothed, safe and at home "with a nice, quiet girl". After reading a newspaper clipping and tossing it away, Babe re-reads a letter from his sister Matilda for the "thirty-oddth" time. She asks him over and over if he is in France. Their mother trusts (hopes against hope) that he is still safe in England but Matilda has guessed the truth, that her brother is in harm's way. She also keeps him updated on recent happenings at home (including her opinion of two of his former girlfriends, Jackie and Frances, both mentioned in "Last Day of the Last Furlough"), and wishes that he will come home soon.Slawenski, 2010 p. 116-119: Plot summary ==Characters== *Babe: In each of the three stories he is markedly different. *Matilda: She is the only other character featured in each story of the trilogy and is Babe's little sister. Her love and innocence helps Babe to hold on to his humanity. This sibling relationship is a popular theme in Salinger stories, seen also in "For Esmé—with Love and Squalor" and The Catcher in the Rye. ==Style and theme== As a means of conveying the “psychological turmoil” suffered by Babe, the “interior monologue is encased within the account of a detached third-person narrator. Salinger thereby conveys Babe’s mental disarray within a framework of realistic action.”Wenke, 1991 p. 1920: The story “presents psychological turmoil within a fixed dramatic setting.” Literary critic John Wenke provides an example in the following passage: Babe fabricates “a compensatory fantasy future” while lying in bloodied and stinking “Kraut hole]].”Wenke, 1991 p. 20-21 Slawenski, 2010 p. 116-117 He conjures up an attractive woman, who emerges through a portal to read to him from the works of Emily Dickinson and William Blake. Wenke, 1991 p. 21 Using a first-person retrospective narrative, Salinger alerts the reader that, despite Babe’s life-threatening circumstances, he survives his ordeal. Wenke, 1991 p. 20: The account “guarantees the narrator’s survival…” Slawenski, 2010 p. 118: “The message of this story hinges on two poems Babe longs to hear above all else. One is “ The Lamb” by William Blake and the other is " I Never Saw a Moor" by Emily Dickinson...” == Footnotes == == Sources == *Slawenski, Kenneth. 2010. J. D. Salinger: A Life.

11298545	A Boy in a Bush	"A Boy in a Bush" is the fifth episode of the first season of the television series, Bones. Originally aired on November 8, 2005. on FOX network, the episode is written by Steve Blackman and Greg Ball and directed by Jesús Salvador Treviño. The episode features FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth and Dr. Temperance Brennan's investigation into the death of a six-year-old boy, whose remains were found near a shopping mall. ==Summary== Special Agent Seeley Booth shows up at Dr. Temperance Brennan's lecture at American University. He tells her someone has found human remains in an adjacent field of a local mall, where six-year-old Charlie Sanders was believed to have gone missing. Booth needs Brennan's help to locate the remains and then determine if they are in fact those of their missing six-year-old. Brennan, Booth, and Zack head to the field, where they find a small, decomposed body. Back in the lab at the Jeffersonian, Brennan, Zack, Angela Montenegro and Dr. Jack Hodgins determine that the body does belong to Charlie Sanders and they are probably looking for a pedophile. Booth visits Charlie's mother, Margaret Sanders, and learns that Margaret has two other foster sons, Shawn and David Cook, but Charlie was her only biological child. As he leaves, Booth finds out that Charlie disappeared from the local mall and not the nearby park. Brennan confronts Angela and asks her if she is considering leaving the Jeffersonian. Angela confides to her that this job is difficult for her and she is not sure what she is going to do. Zack is also having trouble working on such "small" remains so Brennan advises him to pull back emotionally from the case. When Brennan finds a hereditary genetic defect on Charlie's bones, Booth and Brennan confront Margaret with this information and learn that she is not Charlie's biological mother as she claimed. Margaret tells them she took Charlie to save him from the foster care system after his mother died of a drug overdose, but did not have anything to do with his abduction and death. Brennan becomes angry at Booth when she learns he arrested Margaret for kidnapping, but Booth claims he had no choice. She wants Booth to let Margaret go so she, Shawn and David can continue to be a family but Booth remains resistant. As Angela works on isolating the image of Charlie's abductor in the surveillance footage, she learns from Zack that Hodgins is extremely wealthy; his family runs the organization that is the single biggest donor to the Jeffersonian. Hodgins pleads to Booth and Angela to keep his family background a secret. He explains that he does not want to go to the banquet the team has been invited to because he will be outed by his family's rich friends and his life at the Jeffersonian will be forever changed. Angela's isolated reflection of Charlie's abductor turns out to be his foster brother, Shawn. However, he was not the killer. By drawing upon her own experience as a child in the foster system, Brennan convinces Shawn to tell her the name of Charlie's killer. It was Edward Nelson, their neighbor. Booth arrests him for Charlie's sexual assault and murder, and arranges for Shawn and David to be returned to Margaret. As they prepare to leave for the banquet, Dr. Goodman notes Angela's distress over her job and comforts her by telling her that she gives the victims back their faces and identities, not "death masks". ==Conception== The idea for the episode was conceived to explore the reaction of the various characters to the death of a child, in particular, Dr. Brennan's team of scientists working at the Jeffersonian, who are used to working with decomposed bodies and human bones. The writers, Steve Blackman and Greg Ball, established Brennan's background as a foster child to "ratchet up her emotional stakes and allow us to see her more vulnerable than ever before."Blackman, Steve & Ball, Greg, "Writer's Block: A Boy in a Bush ", official site of Bones.

10966581	A Boy in a Tree	"A Boy in a Tree" is the third episode of the first season of the television series, Bones. Originally aired on September 27, 2005 on Fox network, the episode is written by Hart Hanson and directed by Patrick Norris. The plot features FBI Special Agent Seeley Booth and Dr. Temperance Brennan's investigation of a teenage boy's remains found inside an exclusive private school. ==Summary== Booth brings Brennan and her assistant Zack Addy to the exclusive Hanover Preparatory School, where a decomposing body has been found hanging from a tree. They retrieve the body and return to their lab at the Jeffersonian Institution in Washington, D.C., where they confirm that the body belongs to a teenage boy, most likely a student. Dr. Jack Hodgins determines that the boy died 10 to 14 days earlier. As Booth asks for a list of students from the headmaster of the school, Brennan calls to tell him of the cochlear implant she found in the victim's ear. She informs him that they will be able to identify the victim by tracing the serial number on the device. The victim is Nestor Olivos, a student of the school and the only son of the Venezuelan ambassador. The team finds it odd that Nestor's hyoid bone is broken, as the hyoid of an adolescent should be flexible and almost unbreakable. While the school's headmaster and its head of security are adamant that Nestor had committed suicide, Nestor's mother, the Venezuelan ambassador, urges Dr. Brennan to find the truth and believes that Nestor had been murdered. The central mystery of the case is whether Nestor killed himself or was murdered. Based on the Tabinid maggots' pupal casing, Hodgins determines that Nestor ingested a heavy dose of ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic, before he died. However, the team cannot be certain if the boy had taken the drug involuntarily but Dr. Brennan is able to give a scenario of Nestor's death involving the ketamine. Combined with the ketamine, the choking would have caused Nestor to regurgitate stomach acids, which would have been trapped in the throat and weakened the hyoid bone. The weight of Nestor's body could then break his hyoid. In addition to the forensic evidence, Dr. Brennan and Agent Booth find DVD recordings of sexual activities, which they discover had led to blackmail. Nestor's classmates Tucker Pattison and Camden Destry had set up a video camera facing Nestor's bed. After Tucker used a video recording to blackmail Camden's mother, he and Camden decided to blackmail Nestor as well. When Tucker and Camden learned that Nestor was going to tell the headmaster of their blackmail attempt, they drugged Nestor and hung him on a tree in order to feign a suicide. In the end, Dr. Brennan and Agent Booth were able to prove that Nestor was murdered. After the case, Booth is given his own access pass to the lab courtesy of Brennan. ==Music== The episode featured music by the following artists:Bones Season 1 music \- * Miles from Montery - West Indian Girl * Sunshine everywhere - Deep Audio * City Streets - Positive Flow * Cold Hands (Warm Heart) - Brendan Benson ==Production details== The episode was written and filmed prior to "The Man in the S.U.V", which was aired as the series' second episode.Bones' episode list , Official site of Bones.Production codes for "The Man in the S.U.V." and "A Boy in a Tree" are 1AKY02 and 1AKY01 respectively.

67215164	A Boy with a Flying Squirrel	A Boy with a Flying Squirrel (Henry Pelham), or Henry Pelham (Boy with a Squirrel), is a 1765 painting by the American-born painter John Singleton Copley. It depicts Copley's half-brother Henry Pelham with a pet flying squirrel, a creature commonly found in colonial American portraits as a symbol of the sitter's refinement. Painted while Copley was a Boston-based portraitist aspiring to be recognized by his European contemporaries, the work was brought to London for a 1766 exhibition. There, it was met with overall praise from artists like Joshua Reynolds, who nonetheless criticized Copley's minuteness. Later historians and critics assessed the painting as a pivotal work in both Copley's career and the history of American art. The work was featured in exhibitions at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and the National Gallery of Art. As of 2021, it is held by the former. == Background == thumb|Daniel Crommelin Verplanck by John Singleton Copley, 1771 By 1765, John Singleton Copley established himself as the foremost portrait painter of Boston's mercantile elite. Though he was familiar with European art, Copley had not yet ventured outside New England and was largely self-taught. He was at the time primarily a portraitist, but he desired to become a European-style history painter. To test whether his art met English standards, Copley completed A Boy with a Flying Squirrel by early fall 1765, which was to be viewed by a London audience. Chained squirrels held by women and children were common in colonial American portraits. In these works, the successful domestication of a squirrel indicated the owner's refinement and education, as the training process was meant to "civilize" both the squirrel and the owner. Besides A Boy with a Flying Squirrel, Copley produced two other squirrel paintings in 1765: Mrs. Theodore Atkinson and Boy with a Squirrel, John Bee Holmes. Copley's 1771 portrait of Daniel Crommelin Verplanck also featured a squirrel. According to the American critic Henry Theodore Tuckerman, Copley reportedly was "intimately acquainted" with the flying squirrel's natural history and had several pet flying squirrels of his own. A Boy with a Flying Squirrel subject, Henry Pelham, was Copley's half-brother. Pelham was born in 1749, the son of Copley's widowed mother, who married Peter Pelham in 1748. Under Copley's tutelage, Pelham became a painter and engraver, as well as Copley's official business manager and assistant. Copley and Pelham held a close and affectionate relationship, as evidenced by a volume of correspondence between the two published in 1914. == Description == The painting is a profile portrait of Henry Pelham seated at a table, and the work's title has been referred to as A Boy with a Flying Squirrel (Henry Pelham), Henry Pelham (Boy with a Squirrel), and The Boy and the Squirrel. Pelham wears a dark blue coat with a red collar, a yellow waistcoat, and a white collar while his right hand holds onto a gold chain attached to his pet flying squirrel. Copley rendered a variety of colors and textures, including the red drapery in the background, the highly polished mahogany table, the boy's skin, the squirrel's fur, and the reflections in the glass of water. Special attention was given to the squirrel, as seen in the meticulous portrayal of its eyes and gliding membrane. The squirrel is shown cracking a nut, which in colonial American art, is a symbol for patience and perseverance. == History == === Transatlantic crossing === A Boy with a Flying Squirrel was completed while Copley was still based in Boston, but it needed to be shipped across the Atlantic Ocean for a spring 1766 exhibition in London at the Society of Artists of Great Britain. Copley was aware of the risks of sea passage to artwork; he had previously lost pastels in a shipwreck in the spring of 1765. In his letters concerning A Boy with a Flying Squirrel, Copley worried about a "changing of the colours" while the painting was at sea. Thus, he assembled a professional team to facilitate the safe transport of his painting to London. The painting crossed the Atlantic as part of a Mr. Roger Hale's baggage. Hale then delivered the painting to Captain R. G. Bruce, a friend of Copley's who was living in London. Bruce in turn gave the work to a Lord Cardross who took it to the studio of Britain's leading painter Sir Joshua Reynolds. The American-born painter Benjamin West was in London at the time and examined the painting prior to its exhibition. On first viewing the work, West was said to have exclaimed, "What delicious coloring! worthy of Titian himself!" Though the painting's attribution was lost by the time it arrived at Reynolds's studio, West deduced that the painter was American because the canvas was stretched over American pine. A letter from Copley eventually reached West confirming Copley as the work's artist, though the painting was still mislabeled as a work by "Mr. William Copley, of Boston, New England" during the subsequent Society of Artists exhibition. === Reception === Following A Boy with a Flying Squirrel 1766 London exhibition, the Society of Artists encouraged Copley to come to London for artistic training and elected him a fellow in recognition of his talent. Bruce eavesdropped on conversations between viewers during the exhibition and interviewed Reynolds on his opinion of the painting—all of which Bruce reported back to Copley. According to Bruce, Reynolds commended the work as a "very wonderfull [sic] Performance". Nevertheless, Reynolds and his colleagues noted Copley's overzealous attention to detail, with Reynolds himself commenting that the composition had "a little Hardness in the Drawing, Coldness in the Shades, An over minuteness". Reynolds further tempered his enthusiasm for the painting by adding that Copley needed to receive proper training before his "Manner and Taste were corrupted or fixed by working in [his] little way at Boston". A Boy with a Flying Squirrel also garnered the attention of Benjamin West, who in a letter to Copley recognized "the great Honour the Picture has gaind you" but found the painting "to [sic] liney". The painting's success in England encouraged Copley to make more disciplined portraits in his late American career and strengthened his conviction to move to London, which he finally did in 1774. === Provenance and exhibition === The painting was inherited by Copley's son John Copley, 1st Baron Lyndhurst when Copley died in 1815. Following the death of Baron Lyndhurst in 1863, an 1864 Christie's auction in London sold the painting to James Sullivan Amory, husband of Copley's granddaughter Mary Copley Greene Amory. The painting was inherited in 1891 by their son Frederic Amory, and in 1928 by Copley's great-granddaughter. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, celebrated Copley's bicentennial with a February 1 to March 15, 1938 exhibition that included A Boy with a Flying Squirrel. From September 19 to October 31, 1965, the painting was part of a Copley exhibition in Washington, D.C., at the National Gallery of Art. The painting was gifted by Copley's great-granddaughter to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, in 1978. The museum's annual report for that year described the work as "the most important single gift to the collection in many years". As of 2021, the painting is in the museum's Saunders Gallery among other works by Copley. == Commentary == Many 19th-century art critics considered A Boy with a Flying Squirrel to be one of Copley's most important works. According to the art historian William Dunlap, the Scottish writer Allan Cunningham judged that "of all that [Copley] ever painted, nothing surpasses his Boy and Squirrel for fine depth and beauty of colour". H. T. Tuckerman claimed in 1867 that the painting shaped Copley's "whole future career". More recently in 1976, the American art scholar John Wilmerding wrote that the work was an "early masterpiece and a significant milestone in colonial American art". Some reviewers observed Copley's painting to be more than just a portrait. In 1880, the American artist and journalist S. G. W. Benjamin considered A Boy with a Flying Squirrel to be one of the artist's most important history paintings. In 1983, the art historian Trevor Fairbrother drew parallels between the painting and "European devotional pictures" as well as the French painter Jean- Baptiste-Siméon Chardin's scenes of boys playing with cards. The art historian Jennifer Roberts believed A Boy with a Flying Squirrel to be "the most consequential painting Copley had yet produced in America". It was Copley's first major noncommissioned work and first exhibition painting. Furthermore, it was Copley's first work for a European audience, and he wanted the painting to be presentable to "the first artists in the World". In doing so, his artistic style departed from his previous work. For example, Roberts judged Copley's inclusion of a highly detailed glass of water—an element found nowhere else in Copley's other works—to be a "curiously overdetermined object". Roberts also noted Copley's "unprecedented" and "unusual" use of a profile format, with A Boy with a Flying Squirrel being Copley's sole single- sitter profile painting produced in America. In a broader sense, Roberts viewed the "triumph" of the painting's critical success as an "originary episode" in the history of American art. She further saw the London exhibition's "direct juxtaposition" of Copley's painting against European works as a key indication of the "emerging distinctions" between American and European art. == References == === Bibliography === * * * * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * * == External links == * A Boy with a Flying Squirrel (Henry Pelham) on Google Arts & Culture Category:Paintings by John Singleton Copley Category:Paintings in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Category:Squirrels in art Category:18th-century portraits Category:1765 paintings Category:Paintings of people

4554788	A Boy's Own Story	A Boy's Own Story is a 1982 semi-autobiographical novel by Edmund White. ==Overview== A Boy’s Own Story is the first of a trilogy of novels, describing a boy's coming of age and documenting a young man's experience of homosexuality in the 1950s in Cincinnati, Chicago and Michigan. The trilogy continued with The Beautiful Room Is Empty (1988) and The Farewell Symphony (1997), which brought the setting up to the 1990s. Although all three share a number of themes and are frequently considered at least partly autobiographical, they do not tell a linear story in the manner of some trilogies, and can be read independently of one another. == Plot == The story starts when the narrator, aged 15, experiences the physical side of young love with his twelve-year-old friend Kevin O'Brien. Although he is the younger boy, Kevin takes the lead in the sexual activity. The encounters between the two adolescents become infrequent and are pushed to the background as the narrator's soul-searching about his homosexuality continues. The narrator remembers his childhood and his parents' divorce, as well as his older sister's constant teasing. Since a young age, he knew he was attracted to men, but he tried to outgrow it or rationalize it as some kind of passing phase. During a visit to his father over the summer, the protagonist befriends a man from the town that promises to take him to New York for some money. The man never appears on the day that they were going to leave, so the protagonist understands that he was tricked. The next time he meets him, however, the man takes him to a hustler, with whom the protagonist has his first sexual experience. During a camping trip to which he arrives earlier than the rest of the boys, he gives oral sex to a troubled boy that everyone else avoided. After experiencing an unrequited crush on his best friend, the protagonist asks his father to be sent to a male boarding school, convinced that the constant interactions with men would help him leave his homosexuality behind. He also starts seeing a therapist, who tries to convince him that his homosexuality is caused by his attachment to his mother. The protagonist befriends one of his teachers and his wife, with whom he discusses literature and philosophy. He learns that his teacher was also gay, but he declares that his wife and God helped him leave that phase behind. Eventually, a jazz teacher arrives and the protagonist learns that he was selling marihuana, so he decides to tell on him. Before doing that, however, he seduces the jazz teacher and gives him oral sex. The teacher gets fired, and the protagonist tries to rationalize his actions by telling himself that he just wanted to use his teacher but did not want to commit to his homosexuality. ==Literary significance and criticism== Catherine Stimpson, a reviewer, suggests that A Boy's Own Story combines elements of J.D. Salinger's The Catcher in the Rye and Oscar Wilde's De Profundis.Catherine Stimpson, 'The Bodies and Souls of American Men', The New York Times, October 10, 1982 Paul Flynn and Matthew Todd call the novel "a touchstone in gay culture just as Christopher Isherwood’s Goodbye to Berlin was in the 30s, Larry Kramer’s Faggots in the 70s". ==References== ==External links== *New York Times review Category:Fiction set in the 1950s Category:1982 American novels Category:American autobiographical novels Category:Novels by Edmund White Category:Novels set in New Jersey Category:Novels with gay themes Category:E.

38019881	A Boy's Will	A Boy's Will is a poetry collection by Robert Frost, and is the poet's first commercially published book of poems. The book was first published in 1913 by David Nutt in London, with a dedication to Frost's wife, Elinor. Its first American edition would come two years later, in 1915, through Henry Holt and Company. Like much of Frost's work, the poems in A Boy's Will thematically associate with rural life, nature, philosophy, and individuality, while also alluding to earlier poets including Emily Dickinson, Thomas Hardy, William Shakespeare, and William Wordsworth.Fagan, Deirdre. 2007.

Despite the first section of poems having a theme of retreating from society, then, Frost does not retreat from his literary precursors and, instead, tries to find his place among them.Richardson, Mark. The Ordeal of Robert Frost: The Poet and His Poetics. University of Illinois Press, 1997: 105–106. ==Background== Frost admitted that much of the book is autobiographical. As the proof sheets were printed in January 1913, he wrote that the poems were "pretty near being the story of five years" of his life. Specifically, Frost noted that the first poem of the book, "Into My Own", expresses how he turned away from people, and "Tuft of Flowers" shows how he "came back to them." In fact, some of the poems were written as early as two decades before.Kendall, Tim. 2012. The Art of Robert Frost. Yale University Press.. . Frost was apparently pleased with the book and wrote to a friend shortly after its publication, "I expect to do something to the present state of literature in America."Kilcup, Karen L. 1998. Robert Frost and Feminine Literary Tradition. University of Michigan Press. p. 89. The title of the book comes from the repeated lines in the poem "My Lost Youth" by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow:Parini, Jay. 1999. Robert Frost: A Life. New York: Henry Holt and Company, LLC. . The line is, in turn, a quote from Olaus Sirma in Lapponia (1675).Hatfield, James Taft. "Longfellow's Lappland Song" in PMLA. Vol. 45, No. 4 (December 1930): 1188–1192 Frost likely chose the title as a reflection of his own wayward early life. ==Publication history and response== thumb|Robert Frost in 1913 Most of the poems in A Boy's Will had never been published previously. While in England, Frost determined to have them collected, and his manuscript was accepted by the first publisher he approached. The book was published by David Nutt of London in 1913, with a dedication to Frost's wife Elinor, who had assisted in choosing the poems and arranging the order for publication. As it was being published, Frost met with fellow writer Ezra Pound, who insisted they immediately go to Nutt to see a copy of the book in print. Pound offered to write a review that day and soon introduced Frost to poet William Butler Yeats. Yeats said he considered A Boy's Will "the best poetry written in America in a long time."Shuman, R. Baird Great American Writers: Twentieth Century. Marshall Cavendish, In his September 1913 review in the New Freeman, Pound noted: "The man has the good sense to speak naturally and to paint the thing, the thing as he sees it. And to do this is a very different matter from gunning about for the circumplectious polysyllable."Hoffman, Tyler. 2001. Robert Frost and the Politics of Poetry. Hanover, NH: Middlebury College Press. . F. S. Flint was particularly pleased with the individual poems using one specific theme each, allowing "direct observation of the object and immediate correlation with the emotion—spontaneity, subtlety in the evocation of moods, humor" and praised Frost's "ear for silences." Poet Richard Aldington would similarly praise Frost's "directness of treatment" and "simplicity of speech" in North of Boston. Lascelles Abercrombie, however, warned that the simplicity of Frost's language did not imply simplicity in his poetry and in A Boy's Will, he believed "the selection and arrangement of the substance do practically everything." William Morton Payne also noted there was further complexity within the seeming simplicity of the book, writing for The Dial in 1913, "A dream world of elusive shapes and tremulous imaginings is half revealed to our vision by the subdued lyrics which Mr. Robert Frost entitles 'A Boy's Will'."Diepeveen, Leonard. 2003. The Difficulties of Modernism. New York: Routledge. p. 186. The youth of the author, however, was apparent to at least one anonymous critic who wrote in a September 20, 1913, review, "We do not need to be told that the poet is a young man: the dew and the ecstasy — the audacity, too — of pristine vision are here." Overall, the book (or collection as some may call it) was widely well-received and positively reviewed. Following the success of North of Boston in 1914, Henry Holt and Company republished A Boy's Will in 1915, becoming the first edition of the book published in the United States. The New York Times said in a review, "In republishing his first book after his second, Mr. Robert Frost has undertaken the difficult task of competing with himself.""'A Boy's Will'.

48405771	A Boyar Wedding Feast	A Boyar Wedding Feast was painted in 1883 by Russian artist Konstantin Makovsky (1839–1915). The painting shows a toast at a wedding feast following a boyar marriage, where the bride and the groom are expected to kiss each other. The bride looks sad and reluctant, while the elderly attendant standing behind her encourages the bride to kiss the groom. The work won a gold medal at the World's Fair held in Antwerp, Belgium in 1885, and is considered to be one of Makovsky's most popular works. It is currently located in Hillwood museum, Washington DC, US. == Background == thumb|Makovsky's self portrait (1856) Konstantin Makovsky (1839-1915) was a famous Russian realist painter who opposed academic restrictions that existed in the art world at the time. His father was the Russian art figure and amateur painter, Egor Makovsky and his mother was a composer. Because of his parents' professions, Makovsky showed an early interest in painting and music. He entered the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture at the age of 12, where he was influenced by teachers such as Vasily Tropinin and Karl Bryullov. After graduating, Makovsky went to France in hopes of becoming a composer, but after touring Europe in order to get acquainted with traditional folk and classical music, he ultimately chose painting. In 1858 Makovsky entered the Imperial Academy of Arts in Saint Petersburg, where he created artworks such as Curing of the Blind (1860) and Agents of the False Dmitry kill the son of Boris Godunov (1862). In 1863, Makovsky and thirteen other students protested against the Academy's decision to only allow artwork of Scandinavian mythology in the competition for the Large Gold Medal of Academia. Thus, all of them left the academy without a diploma. This incident later came to be known as the "Revolt of the Fourteen". Later, Makovsky joined the Artel of Artists, a cooperative association founded by Ivan Kramskoi, whose members were realist artists that advocated for more realistic depictions of the everyday life of old Russia. Notable works by Makovsky of this period are "The Widow" (1865) and "The Herringwoman" (1867). In 1870 he became a founding member of the Society for Travelling Art Exhibitions and continued to work on paintings in the realism genre. He went on to travel North Africa and Serbia in the mid-1870s., which resulted in a significant stylistic change as he started putting greater emphasis on colours and shapes. At the World's Fair of 1889 in Paris, he received the Large Gold Medal for his paintings Death of Ivan the Terrible, The Judgement of Paris, and Demon and Tamara. By the end of the century, Makovsky was one of the most respected and highly-paid Russian artists, regarded by some critics as the forerunner of Russian impressionism. He died in 1915 when his crew crashed into a tram on the streets of St. Petersburg. ==Painting== A Boyar Wedding Feast is an oil on canvas painting measuring , set in either the 16th or 17th century, in which a room of guests are depicted toasting a newlywed couple. A traditionally offered boyar wedding toast is meant to encourage the first kiss to make the wine sweeter. The couple stands at the head of the table (right), where the groom presents his bride to the wedding guests and sees her without her veil for the first time. She appears timid and bashful as the men toast for the first kiss. To the right of the couple, the "Lady of Ceremony" gently urges on the bride. thumb|200px|left|Detail: the roasted swan on a large platter Makovsky's depiction of the wedding, an important social event of 16th and 17th century boyar life, is dramatically lit. The guests are depicted at the table with food and drink served on silverware in front of them. A roasted swan is being brought in on a large platter, the last dish served before the couple retire into the bedroom. Luxurious details such as silver cups, richly embroidered garments, and an ivory chest with a silver bowl in the foreground are depicted. The bride and the other women are wearing pearl-studded kokoshniki, a Russian woman's headdress. ==Provenance== Winning the 1885 medal of honor at the Exposition Universelle d'Anvers (2 May – 2 November 1885), A Boyar Wedding Feast was purchased by American jeweler and art collector Charles William Schumann in August 1885 for $15,000 (or £10,000). Schumann reportedly outbid Alexander III of Russia to obtain the work. The painting was auctioned as part of Schumann's estate on 23 January 1936 and sold for $2,500. Sometime after the sale, A Boyar Wedding Feast entered the collection of Robert Ripley, creator of Ripley's Believe It or Not!. It was sold during his estate sale on 26 August 1949 for $2,200. The painting was again offered for sale on 18 December 1968. Between 1968 and 1973, the painting was acquired by Marjorie Merriweather Post. Upon her death in 1973, the Hillwood Estate, Museum & Gardens was founded by Post's estate, and A Boyar Wedding Feast was donated to the collection. ==See also== * Decorating of the Bride ==References== Notes Citations Bibliography * * * * * * * * * ==External links== :* La Belle Epoque en Europe Category:1883 paintings Category:Food and drink paintings Category:Paintings by Konstantin Makovsky Category:History paintings Category:Paintings of people Category:Paintings in Washington, D.C.

(In 1976 Vandross recorded a version of the song for his album Luther, on Cotillion Records.) In the play, the song is sung to celebrate after Dorothy has killed Evillene, the tyrannical Wicked Witch of the West. Dorothy, the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow sing the song with the newly freed Winkies, who were ruled and enslaved by Evillene. It was later featured in the 1978 film version, sung by cast members Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, and Ted Ross (credited as The Wiz Stars). Given the all-Black cast of The Wiz, the song's many references to freedom and new possibilities (especially as sung by African American characters who had just been freed from enslavement) certainly invoked the struggles and history of Blacks in America. In the onscreen version of the song, Nipsey Russell can even be heard exclaiming "Free at last!"—a reference to civil rights activist Martin Luther King Jr. (His impromptu addition to the song is not heard on the soundtrack album version, instead replaced by sung vocals by Diana Ross.) The song's opening line is sung by Luther Vandross, the song's composer (Vandross' line was to represent one of the Winkies singing and dancing on a table while throwing up an item in the film). The film version was released as a single in some continental European countries and peaked at #1 in Belgium and The Netherlands, credited to The Wiz Stars featuring Michael Jackson and Diana Ross. ==Contents== The single release is an edit of the first half of the song, which in its entirety runs 7:49 on the film's soundtrack. It is backed by the second half of the song, which is labeled as "Liberation Ballet - A Brand New Day." The "Liberation Ballet" is primarily instrumental and is composed of uptempo dance music in a variety of styles, with the film's cast and choir cheering and singing "Can you feel the brand new day" throughout the piece. ==Personnel== *Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, Nipsey Russell, Ted Ross - vocals ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== Chart (1979) Peak position ===Year-end charts=== Chart (1979) Position Belgium (Ultratop Flanders) 14 Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) 10 Netherlands (Single Top 100) 17 == References == Category:1975 songs Category:1979 singles Category:Diana Ross songs Category:Michael Jackson songs Category:Songs written for films Category:Songs from musicals Category:Song recordings produced by Quincy Jones Category:Songs written by Luther Vandross Category:MCA Records singles

Though relegated to traditional gospel production on her last two releases for Jive/Verity, New Day sees Armstrong return to the urban contemporary R&B; sound that marked her mainstream gospel hits such as "You Bring Out The Best In Me" and "Pressing On." "Jesus I'll Never Forget" was released to radio as the initial single from the set. The album also provided an opportunity for Armstrong to duet with her daughter Melody on "No Failure."

27002245	A Brand New Life (2009 film)	A Brand New Life () is a 2009 film. It is the debut feature of director Ounie Lecomte, who directed and wrote the film. Loosely based on Lecomte's own experience, A Brand New Life is set in Seoul in 1975. The film portrays a girl who is left in a Catholic orphanage by her father and her struggle to adjust to a new life. A Brand New Life was released in South Korea on October 29, 2009. The film grossed over US$167,776 and was well received by critics. It won several awards, such as the Best Asian Film Award at the 22nd Tokyo International Film Festival and the jury award at the 2009 Cinekid Festival in Amsterdam. ==Plot== Jin-hee (Kim Sae-ron) is a 9-year-old girl whose father leaves her at an orphanage after remarrying. Before leaving her, her father buys her new clothes and a cake to convince her that she is going on a trip. This coincides with the Korean title, which literally means "traveler" or "tourist". In the orphanage, she tries to come to grips with the abandonment by her father and insecurities about a possible adoption. She gradually makes friendships, although she retains the belief that her father will return to take her back, and struggles (sometimes violently) not to adjust to her surroundings. In the end, Jin-hee is adopted by French parents who are eagerly waiting for her at an airport to meet their new child. ==Cast== * Kim Sae-ron as Jin-hee * Park Do-yeon as Sook-hee * Go Ah-sung as Ye-shin * Park Myung- shin as a nanny * Sol Kyung-gu as Jin-hee's father * Oh Man-seok as Director Goo * Shin Young-sik as Ye-shin's foster father * Moon Sung-keun as a doctor * Richard Wilson as puppeteer/U.S. soldier * Rob Youngs as Sook-hee's adoptive father * Luke Doyle as guitarist/U.S. soldier * Harvey Schmidt as Jin-hee adoptive father ==References== ==External links== * http://cafe.naver.com/traveler2009 * * * Category:2009 films Category:French drama films Category:South Korean drama films Category:2000s Korean-language films Category:Films shot in Seoul Category:2000s French films Category:2000s South Korean films

2492307	A Brand New Me (Dusty Springfield album)	A Brand New Me is the sixth studio album by English singer Dusty Springfield, released in 1970. == Writing and recording == The album was recorded in late 1969 at the Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia. It is Springfield's only album on which every song was produced by the same production team: Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Gamble also co-wrote every track on the album, and the Gamble and Huff duo went on to have success with many groups and singers in the 1970s, among them Harold Melvin & the Blue Notes, The O'Jays, MFSB and The Three Degrees. == Release and promotion == The album was first released in the United States by Atlantic Records in January 1970. Its release in the United Kingdom followed three months later by Philips Records, under the title From Dusty with Love. The title track was released as a single in the US in late 1969, peaking at No. 3 on the US Adult Contemporary chart and No. 24 on the Top 40 chart on December 20, 1969; Springfield would not earn another Top 40 hit for 17 years. From Dusty with Love was Springfield's last UK album to feature her name in the title; all but one of her previous five albums had done so. The album had moderate success in the UK, peaking at No. 35 on their album chart; the US release, however, stalled at No. 107. In 1992, Atlantic Records/Warner Music Group's sublabel Rhino Entertainment re-released a digitally remastered edition of A Brand New Me in the US, featuring nine bonus tracks originally issued as A- and B-side singles in the US in the years following the A Brand New Me album's release, among them recordings made with both Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd, Arif Mardin and Ellie Greenwich as well as tracks from a shelved second album with Gamble & Huff, and one track recorded for Philips Records, but never released by Atlantic (Springfield's contract with Atlantic allowed them to release Philips recordings). Some of these recordings were first issued in the UK on the 1972 album See All Her Faces (which had no US counterpart), others would remain unavailable in the UK for another ten years until PolyGram released an expanded edition of Dusty in Memphis as part of their mid-price series Reflections, entitled Dusty in Memphis Plus and released on the Mercury Records label in the UK and the rest of Europe in September 1980. From Dusty with Love was first issued on CD by Philips Records/PolyGram and re-issued in Europe in the early 1990s. A digitally remastered CD edition of From Dusty with Love was released by Mercury/Universal Music Group in the UK/Europe in 2002, featuring alternate versions of recordings from the 1970 Gamble & Huff sessions as bonus tracks. == Critical reception == Reviewing in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981), Robert Christgau wrote: "Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff have bestowed upon Dusty—who as a singer of contemporary pop has only one peer, Dionne Warwick—the same cool-soul formula that's worked so successfully for Jerry Butler, but here it's wearing thin. The songs (every one written in part by Gamble) echo each other melodically and rhythmically, the instrumentation never varies, and neither does the vocal mood. If only Dusty could bring all her moods together—starting with her harder-driving stuff and working through the title cut here—she'd make a greater album than Dusty in Memphis. But that's a lot to ask." == Track listing == === Bonus tracks CD re- issues === * Track 11. Recording date: March 1970. Recorded at Sigma Sound Studios, Philadelphia.

Singer Jackie Moore released a song with the latter title a few years later, and due to the similarity of the titles, it was thought that Moore had used a backing track for what had been assumed to be Springfield's version, and simply recorded over Springfield's vocals. However, it was discovered in the late 2010s that Springfield had, in fact, recorded the track "Sweet Charlie" instead, a completely different song to Moore's. Due to the mistaken assumption that Moore had recorded over Springfield's vocals, the track remained unmixed and unreleased until the mistake was discovered and the song finally released 47 years after its recording, in 2017, on the compilation "A Brand New Me: The Complete Philadelphia Sessions". == Personnel == * Dusty Springfield – vocals * Ugene Dozier – piano, producer * Roland Chambers – guitar, arranger, producer * Vincent Montana Jr. – background vocals, vibraphone * Norman Harris – guitar * Ronnie Baker – bass guitar * Earl Young – drums * The Sweethearts of Sigma – background vocals * Don Renaldo & His String Section – strings * Sam Reed & His Horn Section – horns * Thom Bell – arranger * Bobby Martin – arranger * Recorded at Sigma Sound Studios, Philadelphia * Joe Tarsia – engineer * Loring Eutemey – cover design (A Brand New Me) * Dan Hersch – remastering (A Brand New Me, 1992 re-issue) * Bill Inglot – remastering (A Brand New Me, 1992 re- issue) * Jim Feldman – liner notes (A Brand New Me, 1992 re-issue) * Deborah Frost – project assistant (A Brand New Me, 1992 re-issue) * Mike Gill – remastering/mix (From Dusty with Love, 2002 re-issue) * Roger Wake – remastering/mix (From Dusty with Love, 2002 re-issue) == Charts == Album – Billboard (United States) Year Chart Position 1970 Pop Albums US Billboard '200' 107 1970 UK Albums Chart 35 Singles – Billboard (United States) Year Single Chart Position 1969 "A Brand New Me" Pop Singles 24 1969 "A Brand New Me" Adult Contemporary 3 1970 "Silly, Silly Fool" Pop Singles 76 1970 "Silly, Silly Fool" Adult Contemporary 25 1970 "I Wanna Be a Free Girl" Pop Singles 105 1970 "I Wanna Be a Free Girl" Adult Contemporary 25 == Sources == * Howes, Paul (2001).

49595574	A Brand New You	A Brand New You is a 2014 Canadian dark comedy film, directed by Kathryn Palmateer and Shawn Whitney, and starring Freya Ravensbergen, Manuel Rodriguez-Saenz, Clinton Lee Pontes and Vanessa Burns. The film was described as "a low-key comedy about a widower (Manuel Rodriguez-Saenz) who enlists his roommates (Clinton Lee Pontes, Freya Ravensbergen) in a half-baked scheme to clone his dead wife". A Brand New You is considered a microbudget film and was produced on a shoestring. It was shot in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is the first feature film of married couple directors Kathryn Palmateer and Shawn Whitney. The film was hailed an filmmaking achievement by critics and garnered accolades for the director as a first feature. == Plot == In this quirky dark comedy Santiago Morales (Manuel Rodriguez-Saenz) a former engineer, is unable to come to terms with the passing of his wife Viviana (Dalal Badr) who has died of cancer. Santiago rents a room in a house as he struggles to get his financial affairs from the marriage sorted out. He quickly becomes suicidal, obsessing over his late wife by watching videos of her on an iPad and building a shrine to her in his room. Santiago is very particular and keeps things neat, tidy, and organized which leads to clashes with his housemate/landlord Murray (Clinton Lee Pontes) who is a total slob and spends most of his time in his underwear in the living room of the house surrounded by trash and clutter. Santiago discovers that Murray is actually a disgraced geneticist with too much time on his hands. Murray was a rising star in the cloning field until he was caught conducting illegal experiments and was fired. He is itching to get back in the saddle so together they devise a plan involving the other housemate, Laura (Freya Ravensbergen), to clone Santiago's dead wife and thereby bring her back to life. Laura has just lost her waitressing job and is unable to pay her debts so when presented with a relative financial windfall for her role, she reluctantly agrees to take part in the scheme to be the surrogate for their bizarro cloning experiment. The film is unique and offbeat as the often twisted humour is made genuinely funny by the actors. The logic and consequences of the characters schemes seem secondary. For example, it doesn't appear to bother Santiago that his wife would be a baby and not in fact "Viviana" in any way other than genetically. In fact he misses her to such an extreme that its hard not to end up rooting for him to see her. There is a secondary plot about another scientist seeking to undermine Murray's work. This comes into play as Santiago and Murray attempt to source the equipment they need for their experiment. Ultimately and perhaps predictably, the entire scheme ends up in danger of falling apart and that's when the creativity in the film shines. The character work and script development keep the characters moving along their dramatic arch in a funny and unique way. ==Cast== == Production == Kathryn Palmateer a freelance photographer by trade and Shawn Whitney a filmmaker, writer and story editor are a married couple who were inspired to make A Brand New You for the opportunity to create together. In July 2014 Kathryn launched a book featuring photos and stories of women who have had abortions entitled One Kind Word: Women Share Their Abortion Stories. Having very limited resources meant much about the filmmaking process relied heavily on the pragmatism of the filmmakers and their determination to get it done. Pre-production focussed on having a great script, finding a great cinematographer, actors, and music. The directors were inspired by the mumblecore movement of filmmakers. Alex Lisman the cinematographer had a documentary background so the directors knew he could shoot fast and solidly. The 95+ page script was shot on location in only 12 days with some days shooting 12 pages in the day. The filmmakers sacrificed coverage to get the day done and focussed instead on tonal consistency to balance both the funny and sad aspects of the performances and script. == Reaction== ===Critical response=== A Brand New You was well received by Canadian film critics. In his review for the NOW Magazine, Norman Wilner praised the cast: "the characters are so weirdly specific and the actors who play them so invested that it kind of works in spite of itself" he refers to the production quality's budget related shortcomings. The film subsequently appeared in a "worth a watch " year end list of Now Magazine in 2015. On his Film Corner blog critic Greg Klymkiw offers the praise "by generating characters and situations we NEVER see in the movies is one of the ways the picture succeeds". All of the critical writing on the film consistently praises the unusual premis in the film and the commitment of the directors to their vision and of the actors to their characters. ==Accolades== *Best First Feature Victoria Texas Indie Film Fest 2015 *Best Dark Comedy Worldfest- Houston International Film Festival 2014 *Best Feature Comedy Highway 61 Film Festival 2014 *Nominee Best Supporting Actor Worldfest-Houston International Film Festival 2014 == References == == External links == * Category:2014 films Category:2014 black comedy films Category:Canadian black comedy films Category:Films about cloning Category:Films shot in Toronto Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s Canadian films
23619277	A Brand You Can Trust	A Brand You Can Trust is the debut album from hip hop group La Coka Nostra. It was released on July 14, 2009 on Suburban Noize Records and Uncle Howie Records. The album has become a cult classic amongst fans, selling over 500,000 units and becoming certified gold after only a month, a feat rarely seen in underground hip hop. The album took over three years to make, due to solo projects from Everlast, Slaine, and Ill Bill. It was originally set for release on September 11, 2007 alongside Ill Bill's The Hour of Reprisal album, before both were pushed back. In late 2008 the group, with the help of former Non Phixion DJ DJ Eclipse and Cypress Hill members Sen Dog and DJ Muggs, signed with West Coast punk/hip hop label Suburban Noize Records. The album was recorded and mixed at DJ Lethal's studio and at the Soul Assassins Studio in Los Angeles, California, with additional mixing done in Brooklyn, New York at Ill Bill's in-home studio known as "Cult Leader Media". "Fuck Tony Montana" first appeared on the Ill Bill mixtape Ill Bill Is The Future Vol. 2: I'm a Goon!, released on December 5, 2006. "That's Coke" was remixed for the album due to sample clearance issues of the original version, which used portions from Bobby Byrd's "I'm Not To Blame". == Track listing == # Title Producer(s) Performer (s) 1 "Bloody Sunday" (feat.

Adam Kennedy of the BBC while praising some the moments of the album said "it’s a tantalising parting taste of potential capabilities, yet until they improve a customer satisfaction hit rate that barely troubles one in three tunes here".

66618252	A Bread Factory	A Bread Factory is a 2018 American two-part indie comedy drama film written and directed by Patrick Wang. It features an ensemble cast and depicts a fictional community arts center in a small upstate New York town that struggles under economic and social pressures. It received critical acclaim. The second part was Brian Murray‘s final role prior to his death. ==Plot== The film takes place in the fictional upstate New York town of Checkford. It centers on The Bread Factory, a community arts center run by a married couple, Dorothea and Greta, as well as daily life in the surrounding town. In the first part, a conceptual art duo, May Ray, arrive in town and begin staging flashy, highly produced but utterly vapid performances. They threaten to siphon away an arts grant on which The Bread Factory depends. Dorothea and Greta work to convince the town council not to reassign the funds. The second part centers around a performance of Euripides' tragedy Hecuba at The Bread Factory. ==Cast== *Tyne Daly as Dorothea *Elisabeth Henry as Greta *James Marsters as Jason *Nana Visitor as Elsa *Keaton Nigel Cooke as Simon *Glynnis O'Connor as Jan *Zachary Sayle as Max *Janet Hsieh as May *George Young as Ray *Brian Murray as Sir Walter *Nan-Lyn Nelson as Mavis *Janeane Garofalo as Jordan *Jessica Pimentel as Teresa ==Production== The film was inspired by Time & Space Limited, a local arts center in Hudson, New York. It was filmed in Hudson over 24 days, following 10 days of rehearsals. ==Themes and interpretations== Critics identified the central themes of the film as the value and impact of the arts, and the difficulty of producing and promoting meaningful artistic work in a market economy. ==Release== The film was released in the United States on October 26, 2018. ==Reception== The film received universal critical acclaim. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, both parts have an approval rating of 100%, based on 30 and 22 reviews respectively. The critic consensus for the first part states "Epic yet intimate, A Bread Factory, Part One: For the Sake of Gold delivers the sprawling storytelling and nourishing drama audiences might expect from its imposing title." On review aggregator Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 91 based on 9 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". Justin Chang, writing for the Los Angeles Times, called the film a "warm and prickly humanist triumph" that "feels meticulously handcrafted in every respect". Bilge Ebiri, writing for The New York Times, designated the film a critic pick, noting that it has "a deliberate pace and thematic ambition to spare — but it also has a ground-level, plain-spoken modesty that renders it hypnotic." Matt Zoller Seitz of RogerEbert.com gave the film four out of four stars, calling it "a wildly ambitious yet self-effacing epic about a place and its people". Richard Brody, writing for The New Yorker, described the film as a "comprehensive vision" drawn from Wang's "ferociously dedicated, deeply empathetic, finely conceived sense of purpose", offering "a detailed, expansive view of local politics and, for that matter, of the nature of community". ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2018 films Category:2018 comedy-drama films Category:2018 drama films Category:2018 independent films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American independent films Category:Films about the arts Category:Films about theatre Category:Films directed by Patrick Wang Category:Films set in New York (state) Category:Films set in the 2010s Category:Films shot in New York (state) Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s American films

3183000	A Break with Charity	A Break with Charity: A Story about the Salem Witch Trials is a children's novel by Ann Rinaldi released in 1992, and is part of the Great Episodes series. The protagonist is a fictionalized version of a real resident of Salem, who was an ancestor of Nathaniel Hawthorne. ==Plot synopsis== Susanna English, a teenage resident of Salem, Massachusetts in 1692, desperately wants to join an inner circle of girls who meet every night at the Reverend's house. The leader of the girls, Ann Putnam, tells Susanna that she plans to falsely accuse residents of their town of witchcraft. The elders of Salem believe Ann's accusations, and innocent members of the town are imprisoned. Ann threatens to name Susanna's parents as witches as well if Susanna reveals that the accusations are false. Susanna must choose between keeping quiet and breaking charity (that is, telling tales). Although she chooses to keep the girls' secret, they accuse Susanna's mother and father of being witches. Susanna then starts to believe in witches until the Reverend's son, Johnathon, gets her to meet an accused witch so she can see they are fake. She finally tells Joseph, Ann's uncle, what she knows, and together, they end any further witch trials. Fourteen years later she returns to hear Ann Putnam apologize for all the innocent people imprisoned or hanged. ==See also== * Salem witch trials ==References== Category:1992 American novels Category:1992 children's books Category:American children's novels Category:American historical novels Category:Children's historical novels Category:Novels by Ann Rinaldi Category:Novels set in the 1690s Category:Salem witch trials in fiction Category:Children's books set in Massachusetts Category:Children's books set in the 1690s

54956391	A Breath of Life	A Breath of Life is the last novel by Brazilian author Clarice Lispector. It was published posthumously in Brazil in the late 1970s. The book takes the form of dialogue between a male "Author" and his female creation, Angela Pralini (a character who shares a name with a character who appears in Lispector's Where Were You at Night). The god-like author infuses the so- called breath of life into his creation who speaks, breathes, lives and dies at his behest. The author loves yet wants to destroy Angela even though he can not ultimately separate her from himself. The novel has been characterized as a lyrically schizoid duet between two distinct but overlapping voices which delve into the inner nature of thoughts, sensations, words, facts, and objects and the relations between each. The text is also said to confuse the two voices, and open up a wild space of contradiction and paradox. When Lispector died she left behind a mountain of fragments that compose what became A Breath of Life. The fragments were structured and organized by Olga Borelli, Lispector's assistant and friend. The final form of the book reflects the dark interior dialogue that took place in Lispector's head near the end of her life. In 2012, A Breath of Life was published for the first time in English by New Directions in a translation by Johnny Lorenz edited by Benjamin Moser. == References == Category:Novels by Clarice Lispector Category:Novels published posthumously Category:1970s novels Category:Brazilian novels

7376439	A Breath of Scandal	A Breath of Scandal (released as Olympia in Italy) is a 1960 American/Italian international co-production romantic comedy-drama film directed by Michael Curtiz, based on the stage play Olympia by Ferenc Molnár. It stars Sophia Loren, Maurice Chevalier, and John Gavin, with Angela Lansbury, Milly Vitale, Roberto Risso, Isabel Jeans, and Tullio Carminati. The film is set at the turn of the 20th century and features lush technicolor photography of Vienna and the countryside of Austria. The costumes and lighting were designed by George Hoyningen-Huene and executed by Ella Bei of the Knize fashion house (Austria). In part because Loren was at odds with Curtiz's direction, Italian director Vittorio De Sica was hired to reshoot certain scenes with Loren after hours without Curtiz's knowledge. The film is based on the 1928 play Olympia rather than being a remake of the 1929 MGM film His Glorious Night."Olympia as produced on Broadway" October 16, 1928 to November 1928, 39 performances, Empire Theatre; IBDb.com ==Plot== In 1907, a widowed Princess Olympia of the Austro-Hungarian Empire has been banished from the Imperial Court to her late husband's country estate. The bored Princess spends her time improving her rifle marksmanship by using flowers, statues and the postman as her targets. When she tires of that, being an expert equestrienner as well as an expert markswoman, she rides a wild stallion to her hunting lodge. On the way she is thrown from her mount by the appearance of an automobile driven by a visiting American mining engineer Charlie Foster. She feigns injury to get to know Charlie better as she keeps her royal heritage a secret from him, for Charlie believes her a peasant. Treating her with his first aid expertise, Charlie gives her his own pyjamas but mistakenly gives her a sleeping pill with a glass of wine that sends Olympia into a deep sleep. Waking in Charlie's pyjama top, but not the bottom, Olympia fears the worst has happened and flees back home where news as arrived that she is able to return to the Imperial Court in Vienna. Olympia is greeted by the news by her mother that she is to be married to Prince Ruprecht of Prussia. She is also reunited with Charlie who has come to see her father Prince Philip about mining and refining bauxite in the Empire. Her rival Countess Lina is determined to ruin Princess Olympia's life by informing the Imperial Chamberlain Count Sandor of Olympia's scandalous conduct with the American. ==Cast== * Sophia Loren as Princess Olympia * Maurice Chevalier as Prince Philip * John Gavin as Charlie Foster * Angela Lansbury as Countess Lina * Isabel Jeans as Princess Eugénie * Tullio Carminati as Albert * Milly Vitale as can-can girl * Carlo Hinterman as Prince Ruprecht * Roberto Risso as aide de camp * Friedrich von Ledebur as Count Sandor * Adrienne Gessner as Amelia ==Production== The film was part of a three-picture deal, which Loren had, under contract with Paramount. It was also a co-production between Paramount and producers Ponti and Girosi. Filming started on June 1, 1959, in Vienna. John Gavin, who had been borrowed from Universal-International, later recalled, "we were being directed by Michael Curtiz, which sounds so good on paper." Apparently, he soon realized the director was past it. > I said to Sophia [during the shoot], "We're in a terrible picture. He may > have been a great director once but he doesn't know what he's doing." > According to Gavin, Loren had looked worried and asked, "Do you really think > so?" Gavin said, "The next thing I know Vittorio De Sica is turning up on > set, at 2:00am every morning to give Sophia a few hours coaching before > shooting started. Imagine! Drama classes at that hour! Still, I wouldn't > have minded a little help myself. So I asked him and he said 'Don't change a > thing. Everything you do is so American.' That sort of left me up in the air > without a compass." ==Reception== Gavin later called the film a "turkey" saying Loren playing a princess was "not what she does best." ==See also== * List of American films of 1960 ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1960 films Category:1960 comedy-drama films Category:1960s English-language films Category:1960s romantic comedy-drama films Category:American films based on plays Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:English-language Italian films Category:Films about royalty Category:Films based on works by Ferenc Molnár Category:Films directed by Michael Curtiz Category:Films directed by Vittorio De Sica Category:Films produced by Carlo Ponti Category:Films scored by Alessandro Cicognini Category:Films scored by Robert Stolz Category:Films set in the 1900s Category:Films set in Austria Category:Films shot in Rome Category:Films shot in Vienna Category:Films with screenplays by Walter Bernstein Category:Italian films based on plays Category:Italian romantic comedy-drama films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Titanus films Category:1960s American films Category:1960s Italian films

16378814	A Breathtaking Guy	"A Breathtaking Guy" is a 1963 song written and produced by Smokey Robinson and released first by Motown singing group The Supremes (1963)The Complete Motown Singles Vol 3: 1963 [CD liner notes]. New York: Hip-O Select/Motown/Universal Records. and later by The Marvelettes (1972). The single was originally released under the title "A Breath Taking, First Sight Soul Shaking, One Night Love Making, Next Day Heartbreaking Guy" by The Supremes, but was shortened after its official release. All three Supremes members - Diana Ross, Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson - sang the chorus with the original title together. :Diana: Are you just a breathtaking... :Florence: First sight soul-shaking... :Diana: One night love-making... :Mary: Next day heartbreaking... :Group: ...Guy? ==Overview== One of the rare singles to feature the Supremes singing all lead vocals, it also was their highest charting single at this point, reaching number 75 on the Billboard Hot 100.Billboard Sept. 7, 1963 The group was jokingly referred to at this time as the "no-hit Supremes" by the Motown staff. However, their next single, "When the Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes", would break the group's "no- hit" streak. It would also mean that, with the exception of Ballard's and Wilson's ad-libs on the 1964 single "Baby Love", this would be the last time any member other than Ross would have a lead part on a single for the rest of the decade. Much like their earlier single, "Your Heart Belongs to Me", Smokey Robinson produced the song with the same sound that had provided hit singles for early Motown star Mary Wells. The Supremes would sing background for Wells on her hit "You Lost the Sweetest Boy" with The Temptations. This would be the last single Robinson would produce for the group until 1969; this is due to the production team of Holland–Dozier–Holland having a very strong hold on the Supremes' released material from late 1963 to early 1968. In 1972, song was issued as the final single credited to The Marvelettes. The single failed to chart. ==Personnel== ===The Supremes version=== *Lead and background vocals by Diana Ross (verses; choruses), Florence Ballard and Mary Wilson (choruses) *Produced and written by Smokey Robinson *Instrumentation by The Funk Brothers ===The Marvelettes version=== *Lead vocals by Wanda Young Rogers *Background vocals by The Andantes: Jackie Hicks, Marlene Barrow, and Louvain Demps *Produced and written by Smokey Robinson *Instrumentation by The Funk Brothers ==Chart history== ===The Supremes version=== Chart (1963) Peak position scope="row" US Cashbox Top 100 75 ==References== Category:1963 songs Category:1963 singles Category:The Supremes songs Category:The Marvelettes songs Category:Songs written by Smokey Robinson Category:Song recordings produced by Smokey Robinson Category:Motown singles
15738569	A Breed Apart	A Breed Apart is a 1984 American drama film directed by Philippe Mora. It stars Kathleen Turner, Rutger Hauer and Powers Boothe. The screenplay by Paul Wheeler concerns the need to protect endangered species, in this case the bald eagle. ==Plot== Obsessive bird egg collector J.P. Whittier is determined to obtain the eggs of a newly discovered species of bald eagle nesting high up on the private island of reclusive Vietnam veteran Jim Malden. Whittier hires mountaineer Mike Walker to pose as a photographer and win Malden's confidence in order to gain access to the eggs. Subplots include locals seeking revenge on Malden after being caught hunting on his island without permission and Malden's inability to express his affection for local store owner Stella Clayton and her son Adam. At Walker's suggestion, Malden visits Stella to tell her how he truly feels. Walker uses the opportunity to scale the mountain where the eggs lie, only to fall victim to his conscience when his goal is within his grasp. Malden, Stella & Adam are united at the end, while Walker provides a local reporter with a scoop about Whittier's illegal hobby. ==Cast== * Rutger Hauer as Jim Malden * Powers Boothe as Mike Walker * Kathleen Turner as Stella Clayton * Donald Pleasence as J.P. Whittier * Andy Fenwick as Adam Clayton * Brion James as Peyton ==Production== At the time the film was made, the bald eagle was on the brink of extirpation in the continental United States. The bird now has a stable population and was removed from the federal government's list of endangered species in June 2007. The film was shot on location in Asheville, Biltmore Estate, Chimney Rock State Park, and Lake Lure in North Carolina. After principal filming had finished, the film reels were sent back by plane to Los Angeles. One reel (of 4) never arrived, so the film was substantially reorganized around the missing scenes (shot out of order) in editing. This partly explains why some sub-plots are incomplete and Malden has no back story.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087001/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv ===Principal production credits=== *Producers .....

9424803	A Breed of Heroes	A Breed of Heroes is a 1981 novel by Alan Judd. It narrates in third person the experiences of a young British Army officer as he is deployed on his first tour of duty, a four-month operation in Armagh and Belfast at the height of The Troubles. ==Plot introduction== Set in the 1970s, ‘’A Breed of Heroes’’ follows the deployment of young British Army officer Charles Thoroughgood on a four-month emergency tour of Northern Ireland. Charles is new to the army and the difficulty he has with adjusting to army life adds to the complications faced in Northern Ireland. Being an Oxford graduate at a time when over 90% of army officers were school leavers makes him a conspicuous target for his eccentric Commanding Officer’s attention, as well as three to four years older than his fellow Second Lieutenants. ==Plot summary== The first month of the tour is spent in the countryside of Armagh, where Charles’ battalion make their presence felt by ending all British Army contact with the locals and pursuing a deliberately more aggressive stance than the previous garrison unit. The month is mainly boring, with most days spent carrying out menial tasks in barracks or conducting patrols. However, towards the end of the period an anti-vehicle mine meant for Charles’ regular Land Rover patrol to an electricity sub-station destroys an electricity board van minutes before Charles arrives. Seeing his first explosion, as well as finding the scattered body parts of a man who should have been him and his soldiers, brings the realities of his situation home to him and increases his thoughts that he should never have joined the army: something which he must tackle throughout the book. In moving to Belfast for the remaining three months of the tour, things take a turn for the worse – something Charles thought couldn't happen after the endless boredom and sporadic fear of Armagh. Billeted in a working factory which produces bottles 24 hours a day, his company’s quarters are ridiculed by the entire Belfast garrison as the worst in the city. The floor given over to officers for accommodation, dining and radio watch-keeping consists of ‘rooms’ created only by cardboard separations. As well as the deprivations of the location, Charles finds the customs of army life difficult to understand and get used to, especially as they seem to have no logic behind them. The officers and men of his battalion learn to deal with the pressures and squalor of urban guerrilla warfare by drinking, making mischief and engaging in sexual orgies. Charles, always aloof from his brother officers and institutionally separated from his men, finds it hard not to constantly question his own competency and worth, both as an officer and a human being. Having been involved in two riots, he is moved to Battalion Headquarters after the Press Relations Officer (PRO) has a negligent discharge and shoots himself in the foot. Charles shares his room with the Adjutant, and sets about ensuring that the battalion is seen in a good light by the press. This task is complicated somewhat by his Commanding Officer's hatred of the press and idiosyncratic way of doing things, but Charles finds living in the police station which houses HQ much more bearable than the grim surrounds of the factory. More escapades follow, with Charles being involved in heart racing riots and close scrapes with members of the Provisional Irish Republican Army, as well as comic activities with his brother officers. During this time, Charles begins writing indirectly for The Times. His job as PRO leads him into contact with The Times' cowardly and drunkard Northern Ireland correspondent Beazley, who pays Charles and his Lance Corporal photographer to write and send his dispatches, thus allowing himself to avoid danger and sit in his hotel bar. Charles’ slightly more pleasant life at HQ ends abruptly, however, with the bombing of the police station. The adjutant is killed and their room destroyed, leading Charles to be sent back to the Factory but still in his role as PRO. More brilliantly described riots and arms finds occur, while Charles realises that he both enjoys and excels at journalism through his arrangement with Beazley. Charles resolves to leave the army, and eventually amasses enough money to buy himself out of his contract which runs for another few years. His resignation is accepted, and he gains permission to leave on his battalion's return to England. The climactic scene of the book involves Charles and his CO in a gun battle with some young IRA gunmen. Fighting through an alley, Charles fires at an armed man in his twenties. He misses his target several times, before hitting his mark and killing the man. As Charles and the CO run on up the alley an unarmed teenage boy jumps out from the side. Charles points his gun at him and shouts, "Don't move!", then the CO shoots the unarmed boy twice killing him. Charles’ reaction to his first kill is necessarily short, the battalion is preparing to leave Northern Ireland and return home. The novel ends with Charles, for the first time in the novel, being completely at ease, enjoying a parachute drop into England and revelling in the fact that all he has to worry about is the drop itself. ==Characters== 2nd Lt.

Authors such as James Cox and Kylo-Patrick Hart have cited A Bride for Henry as within a subgenre of screwball comedies termed "sentimental comedy", where plots deal with domestic struggles but avoid true threats of adultery and ultimately defend marriage. The formation of the Production Code Administration (PCA) hastened the production of sentimental comedies; others include Maybe It's Love (1935), Three Married Men (1936), and Wife, Doctor, and Nurse (1937).Kylo-Patrick R.

Although Henry has been in love with her for years, he gets fed up and spends his time on their honeymoon with his old girlfriend, wealthy Helen Van Orden (Claudia Dell), and a bevy of beauties.

The film was also broadcast as a four-and-a- half-hour, six-episode television series ("serial edition") on the Japanese SKY PerfecTV! service's BS SKY PerfecTV! channel.

23680228	A Bride for a Ride	A Bride for a Ride is a 2009 Hong Kong television series based on the traditional Pingtan story of the same name. Set during the prosperous Ming dynasty of China, the drama revolves around the rich and influential Wong family and their comedic ties with Chow Man-bun, a young and handsome scholar who has a specialty in cross-dressing. To prove his worth to Wong Sau-ying, his ideal lover, he cross dresses as a beauty in a lantern festival so he can get closer to her. Sau-ying's older brother, Tiger Wong, sees Man-bun's beauty and kidnaps him home. A Bride for a Ride consists of elements of Cantonese opera. Chin Kar-lok, who stars as Tiger Wong, is also the drama's action choreographer. ==Synopsis== Foolhardy Tiger Wong (Chin) is annoyed with his mother (Wong) for consistently pressuring him to get married. He therefore snatches Chow Man-bun (Chan) who is in female disguise to be his bride and arranges for Man-bun to stay at his younger sister Sau-ying's (Wu) chamber for the night. After this, Tiger has no choice but to marry Sau-ying to Man-bun while setting up strict rules to torture Man-bun in the house. Clever Man-bun makes use of the chivalrous woman Mo Sam-leung (So) to control Tiger and misleads Sam-leung that Tiger is her long lost rescuer. Using tricks to upset Tiger, he makes Tiger marry Sam-leung. Since then, Sam-leung tries every means to domesticate her husband and that almost drives him insane. Man-bun is relieved to escape Tiger's manipulation but he carelessly causes much trouble elsewhere. A Bride for A Ride brings you a modern perspective of this traditional tale and you'll surely be surprised with its astonishing approach. ==Cast== : Note: Some of the characters' names are in Cantonese romanisation. *Chin Kar-lok as Tiger Wong *Sammul Chan as Chow Man-bun *Louisa So as Mo Sam- leung *Joseph Lee as Chuk Chi-shan *Nancy Wu as Wong Sau-ying *Rain Lau as Wong Kwai-fei *Gigi Wong as Lau Bing-tai *Mimi Chu as Sheung Ping *Cheung Kwok-keung as Lau Gan *Nicky Law as Ching-tak Emperor *Catherine Chau as So- kam *Chun Wong as Magistrate Bei Mat *Natalie Wong as Lee Fung *Deno Cheung as Lee Lung *Macy Chan as Sze Mung-lo *Wong Man Piu as the Prince of Ning ==Viewership ratings== The following is a table that includes a list of the total ratings points based on television viewership.

43098388	A Bride from the Bush	A Bride from the Bush is the first novel written by E. W. Hornung. He started writing the book while working as a tutor for Charles Joseph Parsons in Mossgiel Station, New South Wales, Australia. The novel was initially published by Smith, Elder & Co. as a serial in the Cornhill Magazine, and then published in book format by the same company in October 1890. As with Tiny Luttrell and The Unbidden Guest, two of Hornung's other early novels, A Bride from the Bush points out flaws in British society by presenting the country through an Australian perspective. A reviewer from The New York Times called the novel "a most piquant contrast between civilization and crudity". The writer Thomas Alexander Browne called the titular character of A Bride from the Bush "a libel to Australian womankind". A Punch editor made the opposite claim, arguing that the protagonist of the novel is more kind-hearted and attractive than actual Australians. Hornung's later stories in the A. J. Raffles series achieved much more popularity than A Bride from the Bush. Nonetheless, he himself liked A Bride from the Bush and his other Australian stories better than those of Raffles. When he published the novel Peccavi in 1900, a critic from The Advertiser wrote a scathing review, writing that Hornung should go back to Australia so he would be inspired to write something as good as A Bride from the Bush again. Upon Hornung's death, a tribute in The Freeman's Journal called A Bride from the Bush "the best and the best known" of Hornung's Australia-related stories. In 1924 André Cœuroy and Theodore Baker argued in The Musical Quarterly that Hornung's characterisation of the novel's hero as being pitiable for being unable to appreciate anthems demonstrates that A Bride from the Bush is typical of other novels of the time in favouring vocal church music. ==References== Category:1890 British novels Category:Australia–United Kingdom relations Category:Novels about colonialism Category:Novels set in the United Kingdom Category:Works by E.

12187025	A Bride of the Plains	A Bride of the Plains is a historical novel written in 1915 by Baroness Orczy, the author of the famous The Scarlet Pimpernel series. It is dedicated to the memory of Lajos Kossuth, and in the dedication the author cries out to the dead Hungarian patriot and asks him: "What would YOU have said now had vou lived to see your country tied to Austria’s chariot-wheels, the catspaw and tool of the Teutonic race which you abhorred?" ==Plot summary== The story is set in Hungary and the scene is laid in a village close to the Maros. > The sharp, cracked sound of the Elevation bell breaks the silence of the > summer morning. The good Pater Bonifacius is saying Mass: he, at any rate, > is astir and busy with his day’s work and obligations. Surely it is strange > that at so late an hour in mid-September, with the maize waiting to be > gathered in, the population of Marosfalva should be still absent from the > fields! Hej ! But, stranger, what would you ? Such a day is-this Fourteenth > of September. What ? You did not know it? The Fourteenth of September, the > ugliest, blackest, most God forsaken day in the whole year! What kind of a > stranger are you if you do not know that? On this hideous day all the finest > lads in the village are taken away to be made into soldiers by the > abominable Government? Three years! Why, the lad is a mere child when he > goes-one-and-twenty on his last birthday, bless him! still wanting a > mother’s care of his stomach, and a father’s heavy stick across his back > from time to time to keep him from too much love-making. Three years ! When > he comes back he is a man and has notions of his own. Three years! What are > the chances he comes back at all? Bosnia! Where in the world is that? My > God, how they hate it!

They hate to be packed into railway carriages like so many > dried heads of maize in a barn... and the rude alien sergeant with his > 'Vorwarts!' and 'Marsch!' and 'Rechts!' and 'Links!' I ask you in the name > of the Holy Virgin what kind of gibberish is that? On this particular fourteenth of September it is Andor's turn due to go. On the eve preceding it, at the village merrymaking, as the whole population spends its last happy hours trying to forget the hideous events that will occur in the morning, he tokens himself to Elsa the village beauty. It is Elsa and Andor that everyone is watching. He is tall and broad-shouldered with the supple limbs of a young stag, and the mad irresponsible movements of a young colt. The young couple dread the next day, which comes all too soon. They are at the station now, the last bell has sounded. For each lad only one girl, and there she is at the foot of the carriage steps, a corner of her ribbon, or handkerchief or cotton petticoat stuffed into her mouth to prevent herself from bursting into sobs. The pain and loss of conscription. It is some time since Andor was conscripted but there has been no news of him so Elsa is forced to betroth herself to the wealthy and sinister Béla, after being placed in the terrible alternative of either being faithless to Andor or disobedient to her mother. It is characteristic of Hungarian society at the time that of the two options available the latter seemed by far the more heinous. On the eve of Elsa's wedding Andor suddenly reappears, and is indirectly concerned in the assassination of Béla which takes place the same night. The story begins and ends with festival mingled with tragedy.

28945390	A Bride's Story	is a Japanese historical romance manga series written and illustrated by Kaoru Mori. It was first serialized in Enterbrain's Harta (formerly known as Fellows!) magazine from October 2008 to November 2020, after which it transferred to Kadokawa's magazine in June 2021. Its serial chapters have been collected into fourteen bound volumes as of October 2022. Yen Press licensed the series for an English-language release in North America. A Bride's Story won the ("Intergenerational Award") at the Angoulême International Comics Festival in 2012, as well as the 7th Manga Taishō Award in 2014. ==Synopsis== Set in a rural town near the Caspian Sea during the Russian conquest of Central Asia in the late 19th century, A Bride's Story revolves around a young woman, Amira, who travels from a distant village across the mountains to marry Karluk, a young man eight years her junior. The series follows their relationship as it develops, while introducing storylines about other young women and their daily lives with their respective fiancés and husbands along the Silk Road, and their struggle to keep on their livinghood amidst the advance of the Russian Empire's army. ==Characters== ===Eihon family=== The Eihon family descended from nomads, but have lived in a village for several generations. The family is largely patrilocal, but Yusuf, a son-in-law, married into the family. ; :A twenty-year-old woman and Karluk's bride. She stems from a different (semi-nomadic) tribe. She is skilled in archery, horse- riding, and hunting. A free-spirited, adventurous woman, she is more open and outgoing in her day-to-day activities compared with the rest of the women in the family, who are noticeably more reserved. Despite the noticeable age gap between her and Karluk, she genuinely loves him. Unknown to Amira, some of the men she encounters look down on her because she is considered old for a new bride, and long past the traditional age when women in the society have started having children. ; :Amira's twelve-year-old husband. He is the youngest son of Akunbek and Sanira. He works very hard to be a good traditional husband to Amira, but because of his young age, he struggles to form a closer relationship with her. Karluk is considered an oddity in that he is younger than his bride; traditionally the bride is usually many years younger than the groom. Some men treat Karluk with pity since they fear that his wife will be too old when he is mature enough to have children with her. ; :Karluk's grandfather. ; :Karluk's grandmother who hails from the same clan as Amira and was at least acquainted with Amira's father prior to her marriage to Mahatbek. Naturally, she is very protective of Amira. Like Amira, she is a skillful archer and rider and remains a fearsome individual despite her advanced age. She is nonetheless a loving matriarch who practices her own brand of tough love. As a firm believer in the importance of needlework, she guides both Pariya and Tileke in realising both the necessity of the skill and the matriarchal history that is passed down through it. ; :Karluk's father. Serves as one of the village elders due to his wealth and status. While he is a traditional man, he is also very understanding and very supportive of Karluk and Amira's marriage. ; :Karluk's mother. ; :Yusuf's wife and Karluk's elder sister. She is often surprised by Amira's carefree and spontaneous personality. She patiently explains to Amira when their tribal customs differ. Her three sons often exasperate her with their rowdiness, but she loves them all the same. ; :Karluk's brother-in-law. Seleke's husband. He lives with his wife's family and is a loving yet reasonable father. ; :Daughter of Seleke and Yusuf, and Karluk's niece. As the elder sister of three rowdy brothers, she is more assertive and bossy around them. She loves falcons and is very talented at embroidering. ;, , and :The eldest, middle, and youngest sons of Seleke and Yusuf, respectively, and Karluk's nephews. The trio are playful and rambunctious. Though not malicious, Torkcan and Chalg can go overboard in teasing Rostem, causing him to cry and prompting Yusuf to step in. ; :An English traveler and researcher who lives with the Eihon family. He has been researching the customs, language, and culture of the tribes and peoples. He later leaves the town to visit his friend in Ankara and acquire a camera so that he can record the cultures and people he comes across. ===Residents of the town=== ; :A young woman who is introduced in chapter 6; attracted to Amira's free-spirited nature, the two become good friends. Pariya has always struggled to be a traditional woman in the society, but her habit of speaking her mind regardless of situation creates a lot of uncomfortable situations. As a result, she tends to become anxious in social situations, which results in embarrassing outbursts. She is very good at baking and skilled at creating extremely elaborate designs in her bread, which she teaches to Amira. Her father is Togo, a potter, who feels rather resigned at trying to find a suitable husband for his daughter because her outspoken nature tends to scare off potential suitors. This changes when she is betrothed to Umar, much to her joy, but she becomes anxious trying to act more mature and reliable in order to please him, which sometimes leads to unexpected results. :Pariya also appears in a short-comic spin-off of the series called "Pariya-san wa Otoshigoro". ; :An old man who raises sheep, and told of wolves living around Soma Lake. Introduced in chapter 1. ; :A lovely young woman in the village who is well-regarded because she is skillful at domestic tasks and is well- mannered and good-natured. She is known to have many suitors. Pariya aspires to more like her as she perceives Kamola to be an ideal young woman and tries to discreetly to observe her. When Kamola believes that she has inadvertently angered Pariya due to Pariya's behavior, Pariya admits that she actually looks up to Kamola, who in turn confesses that she admires Pariya's ability to speak her mind. Through Amira's encouragement, Pariya and Kamola become friends. ===Halgal family=== The family Amira was born into. They are nomadic during the summer. Introduced in chapter 4. ; :Amira's eldest brother, a serious and stoic man. He is a respectful individual who addresses Balkirsh as an "esteemed mother" and Karluk as an "honoured brother". He is not present during Amira's wedding, a conspicuous absence that Amira's father-in-law brings up. He struggles between loyalty to his clan and affection for his sister. Though he does not openly oppose his clan's orders, he has expressed frustration over the decisions of his elders. Although he goes along with the attack on Amira's village, he is quick to defend the villagers the moment his clan is betrayed by the Balkans. Initially mistaken for an enemy, he is saved by the village women's intercession. He becomes the leader of the Halgal clan after his father's death in the battle against Amira's village. ; :A maternal cousin of Amira and Azel. His clothing differs from Azel and Baimat's because he is a maternal, not paternal, relative. His deadpan sense of humour and preoccupation with food make him appear more flippant than he is. He disagrees with the clan elders on many matters but does not bother voicing his sentiments because he understands it is futile. This does not stop him from trying to convince Azel to persuade Azel's father, the clan leader, from abandoning the idea to marry Amira to the Numaji as he knows that the Numaji are physically, often fatally, violent to their women. He wants to marry, but understands that the current state of his clan makes it difficult to attract any brides. ; :A paternal cousin of Amira and Azel. Unlike Joruk, Baimat is reserved, stoic, and dependable. He has a stricter sense of morality compared to Joruk and calls the latter out for filching some apricots from a tree in Amira's village. However, like Azel and Joruk, he privately disagrees with the clan elders. He is shown to be a perceptive and encouraging individual, correctly assessing Karluk's feelings towards hunting and Amira, while cheering him up after he makes mistakes while learning to hunt. ; :One of Amira and Azel's younger sisters. Amira describes her as lively and healthy, recalling that Aterui had never been sick. Her death after marrying the Numaji comes as a sudden shock to Amira, but Joruk reveals that she was beaten to death, presumably by her husband. Joruk elaborates that the beating was so severe that her bones shattered, while the matriarch Balkirsh confirms that the Numaji are a violent, barbaric bunch. ; :Another one of Amira, Aterui, and Azel's younger sisters. Like Aterui, she dies shortly after marrying the Numaji. She is heavily implied to have been a victim of domestic abuse. Her death shocks Amira, as she was alive prior to Amira's marriage. Aterui and Karahiga both die within a year of Amira's wedding. ===Other characters=== ; :A clan notorious for their wealth and brutality. ; :A young nomadic woman living with her mother-in-law. Introduced in chapter 12. Married into her current family at age sixteen, but in a few years became a widow of all its five sons as per tradition, which dictates that a widow with no children marries one of her husband's brothers. Since her father-in-law also died, she helps and keeps company to her mother-in-law instead of going back to her own family. She becomes romantically involved with Mr. Smith, and eventually follows him to Ankara. ; :An old nomadic woman. She wishes for Talas to have a future with a loving husband and won't accept any marriage offers that would make her daughter-in-law unhappy, including the one from her uncle. She tries to convince Smith to marry Talas, but fails. Later marries Talas's uncle in order to secure a good match for her. ; :The brother of Talas's father-in-law. A wealthy, aggressive man that wants Talas to be a second wife for his son. He reports Smith to the town's authorities which leads to Smith's arrest and later marries Talas's mother-in-law. ; : Smith's guide to Ankara. Introduced in chapter 15. He is associated with the local military, and unabashedly greedy and resourceful, taking advantage of a situation as he sees fit. He is unmarried, but expresses interest in finding a wife when he feels he has obtained sufficient financial stability. ; : Twin sisters from a thriving fishing village who are of marriageable age. They are very mischievous and are always together, sharing the same ideas about nearly everything. When Mr. Smith and Ali arrive in their village, Laila and Leyli have been causing trouble trying to find wealthy grooms for themselves who will also bend to their will. Their father later marries the two sisters to the first and second sons of one of his friends. ; : Laila and Leyli's father is a fisherman who is strict with his children. He allows Mr. Smith to remain at his house believing he is a doctor. Though he wants to find good husbands for his daughters, he is reluctant to do so because he worries about the expense of dowries for both of them. The twins' mother, , is also very strict with them, often having little patience for their antics and not hesitating to resort to severe methods to ensure they will be good wives someday. However, she cares for them deeply and it is implied she was very much like her daughters when she was young. The girls' family also includes several younger siblings, their maternal aunt, their grandfather, and their grandmother, who proves to be very adept at tricking the twins into doing household tasks. ; : Sarmaan and Farsami are the eldest and second sons, respectively, of a fisherman, and both happen to be fishermen themselves. Their father is an old friend of Laila and Leyli's father and the brothers are childhood friends of the twins. When their father suggests that the twins marry the brothers, they are mostly indifferent and admit to have been expected it. When their fathers are too caught up with arguing about dowries, the brothers are arbitrarily matched to the twins so they will get to know each other better. Both brothers express a mature attitude towards marriage, and with both pairs satisfied with the matches, Sarm is paired with Laila, and Sami with Leyli. ; : The young wife of a wealthy and kindhearted man living in Persia. She is the mother of a young son, Hasan. Smith and Ali are briefly guests in the home of Anis' husband, though Smith never sees Anis herself. Though Anis has everything she could have, she is isolated and lonely until her maid Maarfe encourages her to join her at the public baths. Anis forms an immediate connection with Sherine, with whom she hopes to form a bond of sisterhood with. ; : A taciturn woman married to a poor man and the mother of a son a little older than Hasan. Sherine becomes fond of Anis, finding her endearing. Shortly after she and Anis commit themselves as sisters, Sherine's husband dies because of an illness. Anis persuades her husband to take Sherine on as a second wife and her family joins the household. ; : Pariya's suitor, a young man close to her age whose father raises sheep and runs a traveler's inn. A thoughtful and observant youth, he is skillful at a number of tasks, including calculating figures on an abacus. His father has been searching for a suitable bride for his son for some time and took notice of Pariya when she accompanied the Eihons to find Mr. Smith during his brief engagement to Talas. In contrast to Pariya's other suitors, Umar seems to like Pariya's outspokenness, though she is constantly flustered around him and becomes even more conscientious of her lack of gentle qualities, and Umar's father considers her liveliness to be a positive trait. When her town is severely damaged by the attack from the Halgals, Pariya and Umar's engagement is delayed. ==Publication== A Bride's Story is written and illustrated by Kaoru Mori.

30001997	A Bridge Across and Beyond	A Bridge Across and Beyond, is a public artwork by American artist Richard Hunt, located at the Blackburn Center on the Howard University campus in Washington, D.C., United States. A Bridge Across and Beyond was originally surveyed as part of the Smithsonian's Save Outdoor Sculpture! survey in 1993. ==Description== "A Bridge Across and Beyond" is a welded bronze abstract sculpture which sits, surrounded by fountains, within a large reflecting pool. The sculpture consists of two massive pyramid-like structures that bend towards each other, symbolizing both Africa and the descendants of Africans in America; the "bridge" is formed by abstract African symbols reaching across from each pyramid to the other. ==Acquisition and tribute== This sculpture was donated to the university by John Debrew, Jr., the CEO of Mildred Andrew's Fund. The sculpture is dedicated to Debrew's mother, Katie May Artis Debrew and all single mothers in the world. ==Condition== This sculpture was surveyed in 1993 for its condition and was described that "well maintained". However, since 2005, the fountain has only been filled sporadically, due to cracks in the fountain. In lieu of repairing the fountain, Howard has considered removing the fountain, leaving the sculpture "suspended over a solid plaza." In 2007, Howard's Blackburn Center director, Roberta McLeod, passed out fliers and considered raising money to fix the fountain, desiring to leave it a working fountain unlike other fountains on campus, which were no longer running. Regarding the fixing of the fountain McLeod stated "I want it back the way it used to be because it was beautiful." ==References== ==Further reading== *Journal of Negro Education (Howard University) 54 (4): Cover.

8237659	A Bridge Too Far (book)	A Bridge Too Far (1974) by Cornelius Ryan gives an account of Operation Market Garden, a failed Allied attempt to break through German lines at Arnhem by taking a series of bridges in the occupied Netherlands during World War II. Ryan named his book after a comment attributed to Lieutenant General Frederick Browning before the operation, who reportedly said to Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery, "I think we may be going a bridge too far." But Antony Beevor disputes this, saying that Browning had supported the operation, especially in view of receiving more resources. Secondly he did not appear to have encountered Montgomery that day. Drawing on a wide variety of sources, Ryan documented his account of the 1944 battle with pictures and maps. He included a section on the survivors, "Soldiers and Civilians – What They Do Today". He addressed tactical mistakes made in planning the operation. Until Ryan's book, Market Garden had been a classic example of victors writing the history; that is, popular accounts of World War II tended to overlook the battle or to accept Field Marshal Montgomery's spin on it as being a "partial success". The 1974 book was published by Simon & Schuster in New York and by Hamish Hamilton in London. There were frequent later editions, and a film based on it was released in 1977.

89397	A Bridge Too Far (film)	A Bridge Too Far is a 1977 epic war film depicting Operation Market Garden, a failed Allied operation in Nazi-occupied Netherlands during World War II. Based on a non-fiction book of the same name by historian Cornelius Ryan, the film is directed by Richard Attenborough and with a screenplay by William Goldman. It stars an ensemble cast, featuring Dirk Bogarde, James Caan, Michael Caine, Sean Connery, Edward Fox, Elliott Gould, Gene Hackman, Anthony Hopkins, Hardy Krüger, Laurence Olivier, Ryan O'Neal, Robert Redford, Maximilian Schell and Liv Ullmann. Independently produced by Richard and Joseph E. Levine, it was the second film based on a book by Ryan to be adapted for the screen (after The Longest Day) (1962). It was the second film based on the events of World War II's failed Operation Market Garden, following Theirs Is the Glory (1946). "Theirs Is the Glory." Arnhem, Hurst and Conflict on Film, Co-authored by David Truesdale and Allan Esler Smith. Page x, Introduction. Published 2016 by Helion and Company. A co-production between the United Kingdom and the United States, the film was shot on location in the Netherlands, in many of the real locations where the historical events took place. Though it received a tepid critical response, A Bridge Too Far received several awards. At the 31st BAFTA Awards it won four out of eight nominated categories, including Best Supporting Actor for Edward Fox and Best Score for John Addison—who himself had served in the British XXX Corps during Market Garden. Attenborough was nominated for Best Direction, and the film was nominated for Best Motion Picture. ==Plot== Operation Market Garden envisages 35,000 men being flown from air bases in England and dropped behind enemy lines in the Netherlands. Two divisions of US paratroopers are responsible for securing the road and bridges as far as Nijmegen. A British division, under Major-General Roy Urquhart, is to land near Arnhem and hold both sides of the bridge there, backed by a brigade of Polish paratroopers under General Stanisław Sosabowski. XXX Armoured Corps are to push up the road over the bridges captured by the American paratroopers and reach Arnhem two days after the drop. As General Urquhart briefs his officers, some of them are surprised they are going to attempt a landing so far from their objective since the distance from their landing zone to the bridge will render their portable radios useless. Although the consensus is that resistance will consist entirely of inexperienced old men and Hitler Youth, reconnaissance photos show the presence of German tanks at Arnhem. General Browning nevertheless dismisses the photos and also ignores reports from the Dutch underground, believing the operation will be successful regardless. The Arnhem bridge is the prime target, since it serves as the last means of escape for the German forces in the Netherlands and a direct route to Germany for the Allies. However the road to it is only a single lane linking the various key bridges and vehicles have to squeeze onto the verge to pass. The road is also elevated, causing anything moving along it to stand out. Though the airborne drops catch the enemy by surprise and encounter little resistance, the Son bridge is demolished by the Germans just before it can be secured. Furthermore, troubles beset Urquhart's division, since many of the jeeps either do not arrive or are destroyed in an ambush, in addition to their nonfunctional radio sets. Meanwhile, XXX Corps' progress is slowed by German resistance, the narrowness of the road and the need to construct a Bailey bridge to replace the one destroyed at Son. They are then halted at Nijmegen, where soldiers of the 82nd Airborne Division perform a dangerous daylight river crossing to capture the Nijmegen bridge and XXX Corps is further delayed waiting for infantry to secure the town. The Germans close in on the isolated British paratroopers occupying part of Arnhem at the bridge, and although Sosabowski's troops finally arrive after being delayed in England they are ultimately too late to reinforce the British. After days of intense fighting against SS infantry and panzers the outgunned troops are eventually either captured or forced to withdraw to Oosterbeek. Urquhart receives orders to retreat, while the other Allied commanders blame the various difficulties encountered for their failure to provide the needed support. Urquhart escapes with less than a fifth of his original 10,000 troops while those who are too badly injured to flee stay behind to cover the withdrawal. On arrival at British headquarters Urquhart confronts Browning about his personal sentiments regarding the operation and the latter contradicts his earlier optimism regarding it. Back in Oosterbeek Kate ter Horst, whose home has been converted into a makeshift hospital by the British, abandons its ruins. Passing through the front yard, now a graveyard for fallen troops, she and her children leave with an elderly doctor, pulling a few possessions in a cart, while wounded British troops sing "Abide with Me" as they await capture. ==Cast and roles== Note: Characters ordered by rank ===British=== Actor Character Based on Notes Dirk Bogarde Lieutenant-General Frederick 'Boy' Browning GOC I British Airborne Corps, and at HQ First Allied Airborne Army as its deputy commander, British Army at Nijmegen.

Parachute drops were conducted by the 1st Battalion The Parachute Regiment, only 100 jumpers plus support, 10 man sticks per Dakota. Supplies were dropped from a number of Dakota aircraft. The Dakotas were gathered by the film company Joseph E. Levine Presents Incorporated. All aircraft were required to be CAA (Civil Aviation Authority) or FAA (Federal Aviation Administration) registered and licensed to carry passengers. An original deal for the purchase of 10 fell through when two airframes were rejected as passenger configured without the necessary jump doors. Eleven Dakotas were procured. Two ex-Portuguese Air Force, 6153 and 6171 (N9984Q and N9983Q), and two from Air Djibouti, operating from Djibouti in French Somaliland, F-OCKU and F-OCKX (N9985Q and N9986Q) were purchased by Joseph E. Levine. Three Danish Air Force K-685, K-687, and K-688, and four Finnish Air Force C-47s, DO-4, DO-7, DO-10 and DO-12, were loaned for the duration of the parachute filming. Aircraft 6171 doubled as the camera ship on most formations, with a camouflaged Piper Aztec, G-AWDI. A camera was mounted in the astrodome, one on the port upper mainplane surface, with a third camera on the outside of the forward port cabin window and a fourth under the aircraft centre section. In addition, centre escape hatches were removed to make additional camera ports available, provided that no troops were aboard during filming. A second Aztec, G-ASND, was a backup camera ship on some shots, but it was not camouflaged. An Alouette, G-BDWN, was also employed. After a mishap with G-AWDI, two locally hired Cessna 172s, PH-GVP and PH-ADF, were also used. Ten Horsa glider replicas were built, but a windstorm damaged almost all of them. Seven or eight were hastily repaired for the shoot. The replica gliders were tail-heavy and required a support post under the rear fuselage, with camera angles carefully chosen to avoid revealing this. Dakota 6153 was fitted with tow gear and Horsa replicas were towed at high speed, though none went airborne. A two-seat Blaník sailplane, provided by a member of the London Gliding Club, Dunstable, was towed aloft for the interior takeoff shots. thumb|upright=1.1|Shooting of a scene in Deventer on May 18, 1976. German vehicles are crossing the bridge. Four Harvards portrayed American and German fighters. Their original identities were PH-KLU, PH-BKT, B-64 and B-118, the former two aircraft loaned by the Royal Netherlands Air Force. These were flown by members of the Gilze Rijen Aero Club, which also provided an Auster III, PH-NGK, which depicted an Auster V, RT607, in wartime camouflage. Spitfire Mk. IX, MH434, depicting a photo reconnaissance variant, coded AC-S, was lent by the Hon. Patrick Lindsay, and was flown by aerobatic champion Neil Williams.Hurst, Flt. Lt. K.J., DC-3 Project Officer for the film; AIR International, July 1977, Volume 13, Number 1, pp. 33-34, Talkback column Sufficient American tanks, jeeps, and trucks of World War II vintage were found because many of the vehicles were being discarded from European military (almost entirely reserve) units, especially from Greece and Turkey. The scenes set around the Arnhem bridge were shot in Deventer, where a similar bridge over the IJssel was still available. Although a replica of the original road bridge in Arnhem existed, by the mid-1970s modern urban development surrounded it, making it impossible to use as a setting for a 1940s city. A few scenes were shot in Zutphen, where the old municipality house and the main church can be seen. Additional scenes were filmed at Twickenham Studios. The Motion Picture Association of America initially gave the film an R rating for its use of the F-word and depictions of war violence, but United Artists lobbied it to change it to a PG rating so that younger audiences could see the film. Cuts were also made to the film when released in the United Kingdom to avoid an AA rating from the British Board of Film Censors. ==Finance== In order to keep costs down, all the star- name actors agreed to participate on a "favoured-nation" basis (i.e. they would all receive the same weekly fee), which in this case was $250,000 per week (the 2012 equivalent of $1,008,250 or £642,000).Entirely Up To You, Darling; page 152-3; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009. Shooting of the American-led assault on the Bridge at Nijmegen was dubbed the "Million-Dollar Hour". Because of heavy traffic, the crew had permission to film on the bridge only between eight and nine o'clock on October 3, 1976. Failure to complete the scene would have necessitated rescheduling at a cost—including Redford's overtime—of at least a million dollars. For this reason, Attenborough insisted that all actors playing corpses keep their eyes closed. After United Artists agreed to pay $6 million for US and Canada distribution rights, the film was a box office disappointment in North America, but performed well in Europe. ==Reception== The film receives a favorable, but a tepid response from critics. Critics agreed that the film was impressively staged and historically accurate, although many found it too long and too repetitive. , while it has a score of 63/100 on Metacritic based on reviews from 13 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Vincent Canby of The New York Times said further, "The movie is massive, shapeless, often unexpectedly moving, confusing, sad, vivid and very, very long." James Caan and Anthony Hopkins were cited by many critics for the excellence of their performances in a film with hundreds of speaking roles and cameos by many of the period's top actors. Generals Urquhart and Horrocks acted as military advisers to the film, adding to its historical accuracy. However, some reviewers suggested that the film contains historical inaccuracies and needs to be viewed as a 'Hollywood' interpretation of events. Robin Neillands commented, "A countless number of veterans have urged me to ignore most of the story in the film A Bridge Too Far". Roger Ebert gave the film two out of four stars, describing it as Gene Siskel gave the film two-and-a-half out of four stars and wrote, John Pym of The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote that "by the end of this extravagant film, we have a fair idea of the who-did-what logistics of a costly military operation. The root problem with A Bridge Too Far, however, is that the top-heavy complement of stars never allows for any focus of attention." Charles Champlin of the Los Angeles Times wrote, Gary Arnold of The Washington Post called it "an unusually conscientious and impressive war epic" that justified its high budget A "making-of" documentary included in a special edition DVD of A Bridge Too Far says that, at the time of its release, "the film was shunned by American critics and completely ignored at Oscar time for daring to expose the fatal inadequacies of the Allied campaign.". ===Accolades=== Awards and nominations received by A Bridge Too Far Award Category Nominee Result Evening Standard British Film Awards Best Film A Bridge Too Far 31st British Academy Film Awards Best Film A Bridge Too Far 31st British Academy Film Awards Best Direction Richard Attenborough 31st British Academy Film Awards Best Editing Antony Gibbs 31st British Academy Film Awards Best Production Design Terence Marsh 31st British Academy Film Awards Best Sound Peter Horrocks, Gerry Humphreys, Simon Kaye, Robin O'Donoghue, and Les Wiggins 31st British Academy Film Awards Best Actor in a Supporting Role Edward Fox 31st British Academy Film Awards Best Film Music John Addison 31st British Academy Film Awards Best Cinematography Geoffrey Unsworth 1977 National Society of Film Critics Awards Best Supporting Actor Edward Fox ==Promotion== To promote the film, scriptwriter William Goldman wrote a book titled Story of A Bridge Too Far as a favour to Joseph E.

48910443	A Bridge over You	"A Bridge over You" is a charity single recorded and released independently by the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir, the choir of the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust located in south-east London. It is a mashup of "Bridge over Troubled Water" by Simon & Garfunkel and Coldplay's 2005 single "Fix You", with additional arrangement by the choir's conductor, Peter Mitchell. It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart at Christmas 2015. == Background and recording == The Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir had previously appeared on the first series of Gareth Malone's BBC Two show The Choir: Sing While You Work, a competition between workplace choirs, in 2012. They finished the show as runners up. "A Bridge over You" was recorded in 2013, following the choir's appearance in the competition. It was recorded at Angel Recording Studios in Islington, north London, with piano accompaniment by Liam Dunachie, guitars by Ed Cusick, bass by Sam Weston, drums by Christian Rae, and vocal direction by Dan Ludford and Peter Mitchell. The single was created and arranged by Adam Morris, with additional arrangements made by Peter Mitchell and Liam Dunachie. At the time of recording, the choir's artistic director was Dan Ludford- Thomas, the musical director Peter Mitchell, and the accompanist Liam Dunachie. An accompanying video featuring the song over footage of NHS staff working at the Trust was uploaded to YouTube. === Christmas number one campaign === A social media campaign to get the choir to the "Christmas number one", a period traditionally resulting in higher sales than the rest of the year, was launched in October 2015 by choir member Katie Rogerson, junior doctor Harriet Nerva, and Joe Blunden, a communications manager for the National Health Service (NHS). At the time, Secretary of State for Health Jeremy Hunt was debating extending the contracted hours of junior doctors, a move that proved controversial and which prompted the British Medical Association to consider strike action. Nerva created a Facebook event for the campaign after the video "moved [her] to tears", telling Mirror Online that "getting it to Number One would bring to the public's eye the fantastic service it provides in very challenging times". Rogerson told The Guardian that "it’s a challenging time for the NHS and morale is quite low ... We wanted people to recognise all the brilliant things that happen on an everyday basis rather than feel miserable and unappreciated." On 13 January 2016, the UK Government announced that the value-added tax on sales of the single—16.5p from every 99p sale—would be donated to charity. == Release and reception == "A Bridge over You" was originally released independently by Blunden on behalf of the NHS Trust through EmuBands on 9 December 2013 in support of various charities including Carers UK, Mind and other smaller healthcare related charities. The 2015 campaign's organisers asked supporters not to purchase the song until the week of the Christmas charts so as to focus sales. On the week of the Christmas charts, Justin Bieber, whose song "Love Yourself" was the favourite for the accolade, tweeted his support for the choir's song: "For 1 week it’s ok not be #1. Let’s do the right thing & help them win. It’s Christmas." Following his tweet, bookmaker Coral suspended betting on the odds of the single reaching number 1. On Christmas Eve, itv.com commented that the choir "now look unbeatable". It reached number one on the UK Singles Chart at Christmas 2015, selling more than 127,000 copies, 88,000 sales fewer than Ben Haenow's 2014 Christmas number one "Something I Need". It beat off competition from Bieber as well as The X Factor winner Louisa Johnson, Adele, and Stormzy. It was the closest run-in to the Christmas number one since 2009, when Jon Morter's anti-X Factor social media campaign resulted in Rage Against the Machine's 1992 single "Killing in the Name" taking the accolade ahead of the competition's winner Joe McElderry. Blunden was in regular contact with Morter during the campaign for his previous experience with Christmas chart campaigns. Blunden, who was manager of the #NHS4XmasNo1 campaign, told The Telegraph on Christmas Day that "it’s an historic day for the NHS...a day that the country has shown just how much they love their NHS". Zoe Davies, a medical registrar who sings part of the opening solo, told The Northern Echo that "it gives the NHS a morale boost at a time of uncertainty about junior doctors' contracts and nurses' bursaries being taken away". Chidi Ejimofo, a Consultant in Emergency Medicine who sang the male solo part, told the South London Press "...it is about so much more than the front line doctors and nurses. This song celebrates the work of all the unsung heroes in the NHS, whose amazing work is often taken for granted.". In its second week on the UK Singles Chart, the song broke the record for the biggest fall for a UK number one single, when it fell to number 29 on 1 January 2016. Previously, the record had been held by McFly's "Baby's Coming Back/Transylvania", which fell from number 1 to number 20 on 20 May 2007. The song dropped out of the charts completely the following week, making the song's two-week chart run the shortest ever for a UK number one single at the time; both records have since been beaten by Ladbaby, with second single "I Love Sausage Rolls" falling from 1 to 57, before leaving the chart the following week, and third number one "Don't Stop Me Eatin'", which spent one week in the UK Top 75. ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from the website of the Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Choir.

Aunt Beryl doesn't want them to stay with her and after numerous encounters with the police she says Carl has to get a job to pay his Aunt. He later is rejected. He learns this is because his grandfather had an accident that crippled Skip for life, and accidentally killed his son. After some consideration, Skip reluctantly lets Carl work on a barge. After numerous events that boost the popularity of Skip's barge, it is eventually revealed that a bridge will be built and therefore put all barges out of business. In the end, it is discovered that Kerry Matt died in a bus accident when she was trying to get home to her children, Sarah, Harley and Carl. Once this is unearthed, Carl returns home to find that Aunt Beryl has run off in true Matt spirit to join her boyfriend, Bruce.

24667353	A Brief History of Anxiety (Yours & Mine)	A Brief History of Anxiety (Yours & Mine) () is a 2008 nonfiction book by Canadian journalist and author Patricia Pearson. It is a combination of autobiography, medical history, and social activism that discusses the author's experience with diagnosed anxiety, treatment thereof, the history of mental health treatment in general, and a veteran patient's possible objections to the nature of mental health treatment today. ==Background== In 2001, while working as a columnist for Canada's The National Post newspaper, Pearson was diagnosed with anxiety disorder and prescribed the anxiolytic Effexor. Pearson claims that she became addicted to this substance until missing even one dose caused her to feel "like [she] was trapped in a disco club on acid with the strobe light at maximum pulse".Pearson, Patricia, A Brief History of Anxiety (Yours & Mine), Random House (2008), p.141 In a National Post column written around that time, Pearson described running out of medication at night when the pharmacy was closed and lifting up the refrigerator to see if she had dropped a tablet under there. Her psychiatrist was reportedly unsympathetic, and Pearson began to question the conventional wisdom about mental health treatment that is common among non-patients. Further setbacks in her personal life and career led her to do extensive research on mental health treatment not only today but over the past few centuries. The result was her book, published by Random House in 2008. ==Synopsis== The book consists of nine chapters and a section of endnotes. All of the chapters combine narrative, personal reflection, historiography, and social commentary. Pearson's style is evident in the beginning to the eighth chapter, "2001: A Drugs Odyssey": In this book, Pearson frequently challenges generally accepted layman views about mental health and mental health treatment. "The idea that people need antidepressants because they have a 'chemical imbalance' in their brains," she says at one point, "has evolved into a sort of urban legend".Pearson, p.149 She states that "[t]he trouble with this soothing explanation...is that serotonin deficiency is an unsupportable claim".Pearson, p.150 Pearson also challenges conventional medical wisdom: at one point, she states that, although some psychoactive medications target dopamine in the brain, over 85 percent of the body's dopamine is found outside the brain, and the medications' effect on those other tissues is almost completely unresearched.Pearson, p.85 The Notes section contains 172 references ranging from scholarly articles to the poetry of William James and the philosophical writings of Søren Kierkegaard. ==Reviews== The Toronto Star review writes that Pearson's psychiatrist "chose the pills carefully; she was prescribed the ones he happened to have samples of in his office". It rates the book as "excellent". A review on the webzine More.ca, describes the book as "Part memoir, part cautionary tale, and part an investigation into the history and geography of anxiety" and states that it is "soothing". A review in Metapsychology Online Reviews writes that the book is "a vibrant and interesting introduction to the problem of anxiety" and states that "[Pearson's] struggle with pharmacological treatments makes for sober reading". ==References== Category:Canadian autobiographies
34353837	A Brief History of Blasphemy	A Brief History of Blasphemy: Liberalism, Censorship and the Satanic Verses is a 1990 book by Richard Webster, in which the author discusses the controversy over Salman Rushdie's novel The Satanic Verses (1988). Webster critiques the freedom to blaspheme, and argues against The Crime of Blasphemy (which advocated the abolition of Britain's blasphemy laws "without replacement"). ==Summary== Webster notes that he named the book after the fourth section of The Crime of Blasphemy, a pamphlet issued by the International Committee for the Defence of Salman Rushdie and his Publishers, and that his work is influenced by Karen Armstrong's Holy War (1988) and Norman Cohn's books The Pursuit of the Millennium (1957), Warrant for Genocide (1967), and Europe's Inner Demons (1975). He also approvingly cites Muslim writer Shabbir Akhtar's Be Careful With Muhammad! (1989).Webster 1990. pp. 14, 15, 39. Webster describes A Brief History of Blasphemy as "an attempt to show, without ever aspiring to completeness or comprehensiveness, that the picture of blasphemy which is presented by the authors of the International Committee's document is incomplete, and in some respects, seriously misleading."Webster 1990. pp. 14, 39. Webster gives the controversy surrounding Monty Python's film The Life of Brian (1979), which he calls "a rather slight production" as a satire on religion, as an example of the way in which blasphemy has been restrained not by force of law but by internalised censorship.Webster 1990. p. 27. ==Publication history== A Brief History of Blasphemy was first published in 1990 by The Orwell Press.Webster 1990. p. iv. ==Reception== According to the journalist Bob Woffinden, A Brief History of Blasphemy was widely praised in the immediate aftermath of the controversy over The Satanic Verses.Woffinden 2011. Some reviewers suggested that Webster shows that liberal support for unrestricted freedom of speech is inconsistent with other liberal values, and demonstrates the religious origins of belief in freedom of expression. The book has been described as "thoughtful" and "closely argued" by the journalist Tim Radford,Radford 1990. and "energetic and ingenious" by academic Lorna Sage,Sage 1990. and Webster has been credited with explaining how "we have internalised puritan iconoclasm to the point where we mistake it for a secular universal truth", and with showing that the western liberal concept of "inner conscience" upon which the secularist arguments of The Crime of Blasphemy were founded is a secular transformation of Puritanism.McGuigan 1992. pp. 202-203. Commentators have interpreted A Brief History of Blasphemy as a broadly liberal critique of liberalism, or an attempt to criticize the liberal establishment on its own terms. Webster shows, in Petersson's view, that Rushdie combines a potentially violent and offensive code with the holiest Islamic traditions, and that the language in The Satanic Verses has a charge that he was too careless with.Petersson 1996. pp. 41, 204-205. According to Ruvani Ranashina, Webster shows that a civilised society should have constraints on the freedom to act in ways that have adverse effects on others, and that freedom without responsibility is dangerous, especially if offensive and damaging to a community. She believes his critique of the freedom to blaspheme implicitly supports the group of Muslims who unsuccessfully sought to invoke British blasphemy laws that applied only to Christianity against The Satanic Verses in 1989.Ranashina 2007. pp. 49-50. Webster has been credited by the novelist J. M. Coetzee with showing that "Rushdie has been made to stand for an entire intellectual establishment" that compounded the outrage The Satanic Verses caused to Muslims by celebrating it.Coetzee 1996. p. 234. His criticism of The Crime of Blasphemy (which advocated the abolition of Britain's blasphemy laws "without replacement") is seen as convincing by academic Jim McGuigan. French author Patrice Dartevielle described Webster's work as "anti-liberal" and condemned support for "repressive legislation" (i.e. new or renewed blasphemy laws), while also acknowledging that Webster's concern about Muslims was "noble".Dartevielle 2011. Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, in the James Callaghan Memorial lecture "Religious Hatred and Religious Offence" delivered in January 2008, called the book "immensely intelligent", stating that Webster shows that absolute freedom of speech is neither desirable nor possible. Williams said that Webster "offers some extraordinary examples of 'liberal' aggression and ignorant bigotry" during the controversy over The Satanic Verses in 1989 and 1990, and that he approved of his argument that writers and dramatists who defend the right to offend religion show a lack of imagination, in that they fail to understand the possibility that offending religion may cause real mental suffering.Williams 2011. ==See also== * Religious offence ==References== ===Bibliography=== ;Books * * * * * ;Newspaper articles * * ;Online articles * * * Category:1990 non-fiction books Category:Blasphemy Category:Books by Richard Webster (British author) Category:English-language books Category:Orwell Press books Category:Works about freedom of expression Category:Islam-related controversies Category:Salman Rushdie
44671392	A Brief History of Chinese Fiction	A Brief History of Chinese Fiction () is a book written by Lu Xun as a survey of traditional Chinese fiction. It was first published in Chinese in 1930, translated into Japanese, Korean, German, and then into English in 1959 by Gladys Yang and Yang Xianyi. It was the first survey of Chinese fiction to be published in China, and has been influential in shaping later scholarship. The coverage extends from early myths and legends through the zhiguai stories of the Six Dynasties, the chuanqi stories of the Tang and Song dynasties, the vernacular stories of the following dynasties, and late Qing novels. The scholar John C. Y. Wang finds the study is still "significant and enduring" in providing a strong interpretive framework and detailed presentations of many previously neglected works, but also that it has obvious shortcomings, such as overemphasis on early forms of fiction, not enough coverage of later forms, such as the bianwen and vernacular short stories. ==History== In 1920 Peking University invited Lu Xun to give a course on the history of Chinese literature. A draft version based on his lecture notes was issued in two parts in 1923 and 1924, then in a combined volume in 1925, which was reprinted five times. Lu Xun revised it for publication in 1930. The work was quickly translated into Japanese, then over the following decades into Japanese again, then into English, German, and Korean. WorldCat, the international catalog, lists 175 editions in Chinese and Japanese published from 1925 to 2012 and 54 editions in English from 1959 to 2014.Most widely held works by Xun Lu (The list is not complete). ==Evaluations== Robert Hegel in state-of-the-field review of scholarship on Chinese fiction, notes that Lu Xun had "far less than the complete corpus of classical Chinese fiction" available to him, and there were many items to which he did not have access. The dominant genres of the Tang, the bianwen and pinghua, he continues, had only begun to be rediscovered and few readers understood their historical significance. Hegel concludes that Lu Xun's critical insights into individual works remain useful, but Brief History, "while still thought-provoking, is far from sufficient as an introduction to the field now, seventy years later." John C.Y. Wang praises Brief History for being both "grand in design and minute in execution". Later discovery of new materials meant there are gaps to be filled and conclusions to be revised, but "a bold outline had been drawn and a sound methodology established...." Before Brief History, there was little discussion of fiction in Chinese studies of literature; for extensive discussion of genres and works of fiction, one had to turn to foreign works such as Herbert Giles’s History of Chinese Literature or a survey in Japanese by Sionoya On Lu Xun’s approach balanced presentation of historical context, the work's audience, the work's author, and the work itself. The solid scholarship is all the more impressive because earlier neglect of the subject made it difficult to establish authorship, text, and dating. The Chinese version includes references to the primary and secondary sources, which are not included in the English translation. ==Contributions to the field== Because of its persuasive interpretation and clear presentation, Brief History is still the starting point even for many scholars who do not agree with it. For instance, Professor Gu Ming Dong writes that a "scholarly consensus" holds that Chinese fiction reached “full maturity” only in the Tang dynasty, for "Lu Xun’s view has been generally considered authoritative." The argument in Brief History is that the pre-Tang stories were "unconsciously composed fictional works" (fei youyi zuo xiaoshuo) while the Tang chuanqi tales were "consciously composed fiction" (youyi wei xiaoshuo). Gu points out that Lu Xun's distinction grew from one made by Hu Yinglin, a literary theorist in the Qing dynasty, who stressed "authorial intention". Professor Gu points out that authorial intention is difficult to establish and that authors may have tried to hide it. He goes on to take Lu Xun to task for underestimating pre-Tang writers who recognized the need for factuality but wanted to take advantage of their powers of fictitious creativity. The zhiguai tales of the Six Dynasties may have been scraps left over when the standard histories were written. There has been disagreement on other points. Wilt Idema, for instance, was among the first to disagree with Lu Xun's explanation that the huaben of the Song dynasty were "promptbooks," or at least printed versions of them, used by professional storytellers, (Brief History Ch 12–13) rather than stories which consciously adopt the conventions and rhetoric of storytellers in order to achieve certain effects. , pp. xv-xvii Later scholars adopted Lu Xun's term shenmo xiaoshuo (神魔小说) in Brief History, which has three chapters on the genre. The literary historian Mei Chun translates Lu Xun's term as "supernatural/ fantastic." p. 120 note 28. The Yangs translate it as "gods and demons literature." . ==Contents== Preface 1\.

25804321	A Brief History of Crime	A Brief History of Crime is the third book by author and journalist Peter Hitchens. Originally published in 2003, it was reissued in 2004 under the new title The Abolition of Liberty. The book was described in 2012 by The American Conservative magazine as "a must-read for anyone on either side of the Atlantic". ==Themes== The book challenges a number of commonly held views about the causes of crime, criticising the opinion that crime is caused by poverty or other forms of social deprivation. It also charts the changes in policing from the 1960s to the present day, and examines and criticises the workings of the modern British prison system, including a chapter on the author's visit to Wormwood Scrubs. Hitchens contends that the former principle of "due punishment of responsible persons" has been abandoned in favour of vague modern theories of rehabilitation. ==Reception== Left-leaning publications were very critical of the book. David Rose in The Observer described the book as "a churning, ceaseless rant, akin to the wake of a cross-Channel ferry. It has similar bilious effects" and questioned whether the desperate situation described by Hitchens really exists, citing Oxford as an example. Conservative newspapers assessed the book more favourably. Bryan Appleyard, writing in The Sunday Times, described it as "a marvellous, angry polemic" that accounts for and charts how the British Police force became so "institutionally bureaucratic, sullen, chippy and ineffectual". In The Sunday Telegraph, Theodore Dalrymple agreed with the main arguments in the book, writing "Mr Hitchens places the blame firmly where it belongs: on a supine and pusillanimous political establishment that, for four decades at least, has constantly retreated before the verbal onslaught of liberal intellectuals whose weapons have been mockery allied to sentimental guilt about their prosperous and comfortable lives, and whose aim has been to liberate themselves from personally irksome moral constraints, without regard to the consequences for those less favourably placed in society". ==Publishing history== The book was published by Atlantic Books, () in 2003. An updated edition, re-titled The Abolition of Liberty: The Decline of Order and Justice in England () and featuring a new chapter on identity cards ("Your papers, please"), and with two chapters – on gun control ("Out of the barrel of a gun") and capital punishment ("Cruel and unusual") – removed, appeared in April 2004. Hitchens said in his weblog in 2010 that the reason for removing the above chapters was so that the book "would be read more widely". The deleted chapters are restored in the audiobook. ==Bibliography== * * ==References== Category:2003 non-fiction books Category:Books about politics of the United Kingdom Category:Books by Peter Hitchens Category:Non-fiction crime books Category:Atlantic Books books
70599262	A Brief History of Equality	A Brief History of Equality is a non-fiction book by the French economist Thomas Piketty translated by Steven Rendall from the original 2021 Une brève histoire de l'égalité, about wealth redistribution, in which Piketty describes why he is optimistic about the future. ==Overview== In this 288-page book targeting an audience of citizens not economists, Piketty summarizes his two previous books, his 2014 696-page Capital in the Twenty-First Century and his 2019 1150-page book Capital and Ideology. In Capital, Piketty said that a possible remedy for inequality lay in a "global tax on wealth". In A Brief History, he developed the concept of a progressive increase in the tax on the wealthy. ==Reviews== In her Financial Times' review economist, Diane Coyle said that in A Brief History, Piketty advocates for politico-economic change to reduce inequalities but does not describe practical solutions for achieving that goal. The Literary Review described the book as "an activist's history"a manifesto as well as an overview of the past. In his review in the Wall Street Journal, Tunku Varadarajan, a fellow of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), said that he doubts thatwithout capitalismthe erosion of inequality and developments in economics and technology that Piketty described could have happened. While Piketty did not make predictions about the future, his work—which also includes his previous publications such as Capital in the Twenty-First Centuryis "partly responsible" for the move away from the "hypercapitalism" of the twenty-first century, according to Columbia Journalism School's Nicholas Lemann in his New York Times review. Piketty condensed twenty years of his research into 300 pages with the goal of making it more accessible to a wider readership than Capital in the Twenty-First Century, according to Antoine Reverchon in his Le Monde book review. Reverchon said that Piketty's effort was worthwhile at a time when the left is mindlessly attempting to bring too many issues together under the same umbrella"environmentalism, reformism, feminism, post-colonialism, anti- capitalism". Piketty calls for the state to increase access to quality health care, education, employment through the progressive implementation of taxation on the most wealthy. He also called for a "decommodification" of certain sectors that have become privatized including education, health, transport and energy. Piketty recognizes the real and historic fears of Soviet socialism and central planninghis socialism is participatory. ==References== Category:2021 non-fiction books Category:2021 in economics Category:Books about wealth distribution Category:Books about economic history Category:Political books Category:French-language books Category:Belknap Press books
60121915	A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived	thumb|right|220px|First US edition cover showing a different subtitle A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes (published in the United States as A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes) is a popular science book by British geneticist, author and broadcaster Adam Rutherford. It was first published in 2016 in the United Kingdom by Weidenfeld & Nicolson. An updated edition was published in the United States in 2017, with a different subtitle, by The Experiment. The book is about human genetics and what it reveals about human identity and their history. A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived won gold at the 2017 Foreword INDIE Book Awards for Science, and won the 2018 Thomas Bonner Book Prize. The book was also a 2017 National Book Critics Circle Award non-fiction finalist, featured on the 2017 Wellcome Book Prize longlist, and appeared on National Geographic's top 12 books from 2017. ==Table of contents== *Foreword by Siddhartha Mukherjee [*] *Introduction *Part One: How we came to be #Horny and mobile #The first European union #These American lands [*] #When we were kings 1. The king lives on 2. Richard III, Act VI 3. The king is dead ... *Part Two: Who we are now # * The end of race #The most wonderous map ever produced by humankind #Fate #A short introduction to the future of humankind *Epilogue [*] 2017 US edition ==Synopsis== A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived explains the Out of Africa hypothesis that Homo sapiens originated in Africa about 200,000 years ago. They began slowly migrating to Europe around 100,000 years ago, where they encountered Neanderthals. DNA extracted from Neanderthal remains and compared to contemporary human DNA showed that Homo sapiens mated with Homo neanderthalensis. Today, about 2% of the sequence in European genomes is of Neanderthal origin. The book also investigates the lineage of European kings. DNA has enabled geneticists to construct their family trees going back to Charlemagne in the 8th century. Rutherford shows that family trees are not neat and tidy, but tangled webs. They often collapse in on themselves as a result of inbreeding. King Charles II's family tree was particularly bad as a result of incest in the family. Their rational for this practice was to preserve their "royal blood", and this often had an adverse effect on their health; Charles himself was disabled, epileptic and mentally unstable. The book discusses the genes responsible for some human traits, including red hair, earwax and lactose intolerance/lactase persistence. Racial classification is shown to be a scientifically invalid concept. The genome encodes a huge number of characteristics that differ from person to person, which far outnumber the physical differences between black and white people. Rutherford concludes that genetics cannot be used to define race. Francis Galton and his contribution to the development of eugenics is also examined. The Human Genome Project revealed that humans only have about 20,000 genes, far fewer than scientists expected, and ended up posing more questions than it answered. The project also highlighted the limits of genetics and that it is no panacea for diseases. Rutherford criticises the popular press for their inaccurate reporting on genetics, and companies conducting DNA ancestry tests that produce impossibly accurate results. He says these companies and the press often overlook the fact that genetics is not an exact science – it is probabilistic. ==Reception== In a review in The Guardian, Colin Grant described A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived as an "effervescent work, brimming with tales and confounding ideas". He called the author "an enthusiastic guide" who disentangles the maze of collapsed family trees and inbreeding. Grant felt that he was "especially illuminating" on the ill-defined notion of race, and "how it both does and doesn't exist". He said that Rutherford aims high: the rewriting human history, but called him "a commendable historian ... who is determined to illuminate the commonality of Homo sapiens". Robin McKie described Rutherford's exposition of the Human Genome Project as "elegant". Writing in another review of the book in The Guardian, McKie noted how the author is careful to bring the project's "dreams of a medical revolution" down to earth, emphasising that its "greatest achievement ... was working out exactly how little we knew." McKie praised Rutherford for highlighting modern genetics' limitations, that it is better at describing humans as a species than as individuals. He called the book "a polished, thoroughly entertaining history of Homo sapiens", adding that it is "popular science writing at its best". In a review in The New York Times, Misha Angrist described A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived as "nothing less than a tour de force". Despite the book's ambitious tile, he felt that Rutherford "deliver[s] on its great promise". Angrist complimented the author on his "captivating storytelling" that is "entertaining and engaging" and "never feels pedantic". He was impressed by the way Rutherford dealt with such sensitive topics as race and eugenics, and that he used examples like earwax and lactose intolerance, rather than Mendel's exhumed pea plants to demonstrate how genetics work. Angrist concluded his review by stating: "If genetics can ever offer us words to live by, I reckon these are probably the best it can do." Nancy R. Curtis wrote in the Library Journal that A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived should attract readers of both popular and technical science books. She said it is "amusing and provocative", and "may bruise the egos of a few genealogists". Curtis did, however, complain that Rutherford gives too much attention to European and British issues, and from time to time "succumbs to editorializing on peripheral topics", for example creationism and genetic determinism. In a review in The Wall Street Journal, Charles C. Mann was a little critical of the book's title, saying that it "is not particularly brief, not exactly a history and not concerned with everyone who ever lived". But he was pleased that Rutherford did not fall into the trap of "hyping the science to sell the story" that popular science books often do. He said the author is "an enthusiastic guide and a good story-teller", although Mann did complain about Rutherford's many digressions that interrupt the flow of the text. ==Awards== Award Year Result Wellcome Book Prize 2017 National Book Critics Circle Award 2017 Foreword INDIE Gold Award for Science 2017 Thomas Bonner Book Prize 2018 ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Stories in Our Genes at Weidenfeld & Nicolson *A Brief History of Everyone Who Ever Lived: The Human Story Retold Through Our Genes at The Experiment Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:Genetics books Category:Popular science books Category:Weidenfeld & Nicolson books

Milo Cordell stated that the band produced the album themselves at Electric Lady Studios in New York City, and Rich Costey mixed the album (with the exception of "Velvet", which was mixed by Alan Moulder). Cordell also told BBC 6 Music how A Brief History of Love came to be the title for the release: "Every song is a love song to some degree, about every different aspect of love... The good, the bad, the boring, the exciting, the dreams, the nightmares, the whole thing, and I guess that's what encompasses the whole album, and we have a song called 'A Brief History of Love' so it's apt." In addition to the singles "Dominos" and "Velvet", the album features re-recorded versions of previously released tracks "Too Young to Love", "Crystal Visions" and "Countbackwards from Ten". A Brief History of Love charted on the UK Albums Chart at #56, and "Dominos" charted on the UK Singles Chart at #27. A reissue of "Velvet" in February 2010 charted at #149. == Critical reception == Critical reception to A Brief History of Love was generally positive. The Daily Telegraph awarded the album 5 out of 5 stars, and said the album "shapes up as something of a modern masterpiece." Gigwise awarded the album 4 out of 5 stars, and wrote: "It's a testament to the notion of not judging a book by its cover then that The Pink's debut LP is a heavy and gallon deep adventure into a murky darkness which sees stadium pop choruses do battle with industrial noise and an almost constant whirr of feedback." Contact Music described the album as "reminiscent of the best bits of the '90s indie scene but with the added depth of synths and the wall of guitar 'noise'. A Brief History of Love is a brilliantly bold debut that would be an asset to any record collection - it will draw you in further with every listen." The duo was picked as one of Beyond Race magazine's "50 Emerging Artists", resulting in a spot in the magazine's #11 issue as well as a lengthy Q&A; on their website. In August 2009, "Velvet" was included on Pitchfork Media's Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s list, voted in at #500. On Pitchfork's end-of-the-year Top 100 Tracks of 2009 list, "Velvet" was voted at #42, while "Dominos" was voted in at #18. A Brief History of Love was voted as the seventh best album of 2009 on NMEs 50 Best Albums of 2009 list. == Track listing == == Release history == Country Date Label Format Catalogue # United Kingdom 14 September 2009 4AD CD CAD 2916 CD 2LP CAD 2916 2LP/bonus 12" single (MIX 2916) CAD D 2916 Worldwide Digital download EAD 2916 A United States 22 September 2009 CD CAD 2916 CD 20 October 2009 2LP CAD 2916 Japan 14 October 2009 Beggars Japan/Hostess Entertainment CD (three bonus tracks) CAD 2916 CDJ/BGJ-10008 == Accolades == Publication Country Accolade Year Rank NME UK Best 50 Albums of the Year 2009 #7 Spin US The 40 Best Albums of the Year 2009 #25 == Credits == === Musicians === * All music and vocals by Robbie Furze and Milo Cordell. # "Crystal Visions" #* Joanne Apps: backing vocals #* Joe Scotcher: backing vocals #* Valentine Fillol-Cordier: backing vocals #* Akiko Matsuura: drums #* Richard "Dickie" Landry: saxophone feedback # "Too Young to Love" #* Joanne Apps: backing vocals #* Valentine Fillol-Cordier: backing vocals #* Al O'Connell: bass # "Dominos" #* Valentine Fillol-Cordier: backing vocals #* Akiko Matsuura: drums # "Love in Vain" #* Valentine Fillol-Cordier: backing vocals #* Akiko Matsuura: drums #* William Rees: guitar #* Richard "Dickie" Landry: saxophone # "At War with the Sun" #* Valentine Fillol-Cordier: backing vocals #* Akiko Matsuura: drums # "Velvet" #* Lauren Jones: vocals #* Akiko Matsuura: drums # "Golden Pendulum" #* Valentine Fillol-Cordier: backing vocals # "Frisk" #* Valentine Fillol-Cordier: backing vocals #* Akiko Matsuura: drums # "A Brief History of Love" #* Joanne Robertson: vocals #* Akiko Matsuura: drums, piano #* Daniel O'Sullivan: keyboards, guitar # "Tonight" #* Valentine Fillol- Cordier: backing vocals #* Akiko Matsuura: drums # "Countbackwards from Ten" #* Valentine Fillol-Cordier: backing vocals #* Akiko Matsuura: drums #* Jamie Reynolds: vibes === Production === * Produced by The Big Pink at The Big Pink and Electric Lady Studios, New York. * "Dominos" co-produced by The Big Pink and Paul Epworth at Miloco, London. * Additional production on "Tonight" by Jimmy Robertson. * Mixed by Rich Costey at Electric Lady Studios. * "Velvet" mixed by Alan Moulder at Assault and Battery, London. * Engineered by Jimmy Robertson. * Design by Chris Bigg at v23. * Crystal Visions photography by Chris Bigg.

45611510	A Brief History of Seven Killings	A Brief History of Seven Killings is the third novel by Jamaican author Marlon James. It was published in 2014 by Riverhead Books. The novel spans several decades and explores the attempted assassination of Bob Marley in Jamaica in 1976 and its aftermath, through the crack wars in New York City in the 1980s and a changed Jamaica in the 1990s. ==Synopsis== The novel has five sections, each named after a musical track and covering the events of a single day: *“Original Rockers: December 2, 1976” *“Ambush in the Night: December 3, 1976” *“Shadow Dancin’: February 15, 1979” *“White Lines/Kids in America: August 14, 1985” *“Sound Boy Killing: March 22, 1991” The first part of the novel is set in Kingston, Jamaica, in the build-up to the Smile Jamaica Concert held on 5 December 1976, and describes politically motivated violence between gangs associated with the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) and the People's National Party (PNP), especially in the West Kingston neighbourhoods of Tivoli Gardens and Mathews Lane (renamed in the novel as Copenhagen City and Eight Lanes), including involvement of the CIA in the Jamaican politics of the time. As well as Marley (who is referred to as "the Singer" throughout), other real-life characters depicted or fictionalized in the book include Kingston gangsters Winston "Burry Boy" Blake and George "Feathermop" Spence, Claude Massop and Lester Lloyd Coke (Jim Brown) of the JLP and Aston Thomson (Buckie Marshall) of the PNP. ==Reception== James' novel was widely praised for its mastery of voice and genre, encompassing historical epic, spy novel, gang thriller and mythical saga all at once. Writing in Literary Review, Kevin Power praises Marlon James' energy and imagination in his characters' voices: "his command of a range of tones and voices approaches the virtuoso." However, Power notes the novel's lack of narrative momentum necessary to propel it through nearly 700 pages. ==Awards== The book was awarded the 2015 Booker Prize. This was the first time that a Jamaican-born author had won the prize. According to the BBC: "[Booker chair of judges Michael] Wood said the judges came to a unanimous decision in less than two hours. He praised the book's 'many voices'—it contains more than 75 characters—which 'went from Jamaican slang to Biblical heights'". *2014 – National Book Critics Circle Award finalist *2015 – Anisfield-Wolf Book Award for FictionThe Anisfield-Wolf Book Awards.

The 680-page epic was "full of surprises" as well as being "very violent" and "full of swearing". Set across three decades, the novel uses the true story of the attempt on the life of reggae star Marley to explore the turbulent world of Jamaican gangs and politics. Wood said the judges had come to a unanimous decision in less than two hours. He praised the book's "many voices" – it contains more than 75 characters – which "went from Jamaican slang to Biblical heights". ==Television== HBO has optioned the novel and is planning a television series, although no debut date has been announced. ==References== Category:2014 novels Category:Novels by Marlon James Category:Booker Prize- winning works Category:Novels set in Jamaica Category:Cultural depictions of Bob Marley Category:Postmodern novels Category:Novels about organized crime Category:American Book Award-winning works Category:Riverhead Books books
67227	A Brief History of Time	A Brief History of Time: From the Big Bang to Black Holes is a book on theoretical cosmology by English physicist Stephen Hawking. It was first published in 1988. Hawking wrote the book for readers who had no prior knowledge of physics. In A Brief History of Time, Hawking writes in non- technical terms about the structure, origin, development and eventual fate of the Universe, which is the object of study of astronomy and modern physics. He talks about basic concepts like space and time, basic building blocks that make up the Universe (such as quarks) and the fundamental forces that govern it (such as gravity). He writes about cosmological phenomena such as the Big Bang and black holes. He discusses two major theories, general relativity and quantum mechanics, that modern scientists use to describe the Universe. Finally, he talks about the search for a unifying theory that describes everything in the Universe in a coherent manner. The book became a bestseller and sold more than 25 million copies. ==Publication== Early in 1983, Hawking first approached Simon Mitton, the editor in charge of astronomy books at Cambridge University Press, with his ideas for a popular book on cosmology. Mitton was doubtful about all the equations in the draft manuscript, which he felt would put off the buyers in airport bookshops that Hawking wished to reach. With some difficulty, he persuaded Hawking to drop all but one equation. The author himself notes in the book's acknowledgements that he was warned that for every equation in the book, the readership would be halved, hence it includes only a single equation: E = mc^2. The book does employ a number of complex models, diagrams, and other illustrations to detail some of the concepts that it explores. == Contents == In A Brief History of Time, Stephen Hawking explains a range of subjects in cosmology, including the Big Bang, black holes and light cones, to the non-specialist reader. His main goal is to give an overview of the subject, but he also attempts to explain some complex mathematics. In the 1996 edition of the book and subsequent editions, Hawking discusses the possibility of time travel and wormholes and explores the possibility of having a Universe without a quantum singularity at the beginning of time. The 2017 edition of the book contained twelve chapters, whose contents are summarized below. === Chapter 1: Our Picture of the Universe === In the first chapter, Hawking discusses the history of astronomical studies, particularly ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle's conclusions about spherical Earth and a circular geocentric model of the Universe, later elaborated upon by the second-century Greek astronomer Ptolemy. Hawking then depicts the rejection of the Aristotelian and Ptolemaic model and the gradual development of the currently accepted heliocentric model of the Solar System in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, first proposed by the Polish priest Nicholas Copernicus in 1514, validated a century later by Italian scientist Galileo Galilei and German scientist Johannes Kepler (who proposed an elliptical orbit model instead of a circular one), and further supported mathematically by English scientist Isaac Newton in his 1687 book on gravity, Principia Mathematica. In this chapter, Hawking also covers how the topic of the origin of the Universe and time was studied and debated over the centuries: the perennial existence of the Universe hypothesised by Aristotle and other early philosophers was opposed by St. Augustine and other theologians' belief in its creation at a specific time in the past, where time is a concept that was born with the creation of the Universe. In the modern age, German philosopher Immanuel Kant argued again that time had no beginning. In 1929, American astronomer Edwin Hubble's discovery of the expanding Universe implied that between ten and twenty billion years ago, the entire Universe was contained in one singular extremely dense place. This discovery brought the concept of the beginning of the Universe within the province of science. Currently scientists use Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity and quantum mechanics to partially describe the workings of the Universe, while still looking for a complete Grand Unified Theory that would describe everything in the Universe. === Chapter 2: Space and Time === In this chapter, Hawking describes the development of scientific thought regarding the nature of space and time. He first describes the Aristotelian idea that the naturally preferred state of a body is to be at rest, and which can only be moved by force, implying that heavier objects will fall faster. However, Italian scientist Galileo Galilei experimentally proved Aristotle's theory wrong with by observing the motion of objects of different weights and concluding that all objects would fall at the same rate. This eventually led to English scientist Isaac Newton's laws of motion and gravity. However, Newton's laws implied that there is no such thing as absolute state of rest or absolute space as believed by Aristotle: whether an object is 'at rest' or 'in motion' depends on the inertial frame of reference of the observer. Hawking then describes Aristotle and Newton's belief in absolute time, i.e. time can be measured accurately regardless of the state of motion of the observer. However, Hawking writes that this commonsense notion does not work at or near the speed of light. He mentions Danish scientist Ole Rømer's discovery that light travels at a very high but finite speed through his observations of Jupiter and one of its moons Io as well as British scientist James Clerk Maxwell's equations on electromagnetism which showed that light travels in waves moving at a fixed speed. Since the notion of absolute rest was abandoned in Newtonian mechanics, Maxwell and many other physicists argued that light must travel through a hypothetical fluid called aether, its speed being relative to that of aether. This was later disproved by the Michelson–Morley experiment, showing that the speed of light always remains constant regardless of the motion of the observer. Einstein and Henri Poincaré later argued that there is no need for aether to explain the motion of light, assuming that there is no absolute time. The special theory of relativity is based on this, arguing that light travels with a finite speed no matter what the speed of the observer is. Mass and energy are related by the famous equation E = mc^2, which explains that an infinite amount of energy is needed for any object with mass to travel at the speed of light(3×10⁸m/s). A new way of defining a metre using speed of light was developed. "Events" can also be described by using light cones, a spacetime graphical representation that restricts what events are allowed and what are not based on the past and the future light cones. A 4-dimensional spacetime is also described, in which 'space' and 'time' are intrinsically linked. The motion of an object through space inevitably impacts the way in which it experiences time. Einstein's general theory of relativity explains how the path of a ray of light is affected by 'gravity', which according to Einstein is an illusion caused by the warping of spacetime, in contrast to Newton's view which described gravity as a force which matter exerts on other matter. In spacetime curvature, light always travels in a straight path in the 4-dimensional "spacetime", but may appear to curve in 3-dimensional space due to gravitational effects. These straight-line paths are geodesics. The twin paradox, a thought experiment in special relativity involving identical twins, considers that twins can age differently if they move at different speeds relative to each other, or even if they lived in different locations with unequal spacetime curvature. Special relativity is based upon arenas of space and time where events take place, whereas general relativity is dynamic where force could change spacetime curvature and which gives rise to a dynamic, expanding Universe. Hawking and Roger Penrose worked upon this and later proved using general relativity that if the Universe had a beginning a finite time ago in the past, then it also might end at a finite time from now into the future. === Chapter 3: The Expanding Universe === In this chapter, Hawking first describes how physicists and astronomers calculated the relative distance of stars from the Earth. In the 18th century, Sir William Herschel confirmed the positions and distances of many stars in the night sky. In 1924, Edwin Hubble discovered a method to measure the distance using the brightness of Cepheid variable stars as viewed from Earth. The luminosity, brightness, and distance of these stars are related by a simple mathematical formula. Using all these, he calculated distances of nine different galaxies. We live in a fairly typical spiral galaxy, containing vast numbers of stars. The stars are very far away from us, so we can only observe their one characteristic feature, their light. When this light is passed through a prism, it gives rise to a spectrum. Every star has its own spectrum, and since each element has its own unique spectra, we can measure a star's light spectra to know its chemical composition. We use thermal spectra of the stars to know their temperature. In 1920, when scientists were examining spectra of different galaxies, they found that some of the characteristic lines of the star spectrum were shifted towards the red end of the spectrum. The implications of this phenomenon were given by the Doppler effect, and it was clear that many galaxies were moving away from us. It was assumed that, since some galaxies are red shifted, some galaxies would also be blue shifted. However, redshifted galaxies far outnumbered blueshifted galaxies. Hubble found that the amount of redshift is directly proportional to relative distance. From this, he determined that the Universe is expanding and had a beginning. Despite this, the concept of a static Universe persisted into the 20th century. Einstein was so sure of a static Universe that he developed the 'cosmological constant' and introduced 'anti-gravity' forces to allow a universe of infinite age to exist. Moreover, many astronomers also tried to avoid the implications of general relativity and stuck with their static Universe, with one especially notable exception, the Russian physicist Alexander Friedmann. Friedmann made two very simple assumptions: the Universe is identical wherever we are, i.e. homogeneity, and that it is identical in every direction that we look in, i.e. isotropy. His results showed that the Universe is non-static. His assumptions were later proved when two physicists at Bell Labs, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, found unexpected microwave radiation not only from the one particular part of the sky but from everywhere and by nearly the same amount. Thus Friedmann's first assumption was proved to be true. At around the same time, Robert H. Dicke and Jim Peebles were also working on microwave radiation. They argued that they should be able to see the glow of the early Universe as background microwave radiation. Wilson and Penzias had already done this, so they were awarded with the Nobel Prize in 1978. In addition, our place in the Universe is not exceptional, so we should see the Universe as approximately the same from any other part of space, which supports Friedmann's second assumption. His work remained largely unknown until similar models were made by Howard Robertson and Arthur Walker. Friedmann's model gave rise to three different types of models for the evolution of the Universe. First, the Universe would expand for a given amount of time, and if the expansion rate is less than the density of the Universe (leading to gravitational attraction), it would ultimately lead to the collapse of the Universe at a later stage. Secondly, the Universe would expand, and at some time, if the expansion rate and the density of the Universe became equal, it would expand slowly and stop, leading to a somewhat static Universe. Thirdly, the Universe would continue to expand forever, if the density of the Universe is less than the critical amount required to balance the expansion rate of the Universe. The first model depicts the space of the Universe to be curved inwards. In the second model, the space would lead to a flat structure, and the third model results in negative 'saddle shaped' curvature. Even if we calculate, the current expansion rate is more than the critical density of the Universe including the dark matter and all the stellar masses. The first model included the beginning of the Universe as a Big Bang from a space of infinite density and zero volume known as 'singularity', a point where the general theory of relativity (Friedmann's solutions are based in it) also breaks down. This concept of the beginning of time (proposed by the Belgian Catholic priest Georges Lemaître) seemed originally to be motivated by religious beliefs, because of its support of the biblical claim of the universe having a beginning in time instead of being eternal.As Stephen Hawking puts it in his book: "Many people do not like the idea that time has a beginning, probably because it smacks of divine intervention. (The Catholic Church, on the other hand, seized on the big bang model and in 1951 officially pronounced it to be in accordance with the Bible.)" So a new theory was introduced, the "steady state theory" by Hermann Bondi, Thomas Gold, and Fred Hoyle, to compete with the Big Bang theory. Its predictions also matched with the current Universe structure. But the fact that radio wave sources near us are far fewer than from the distant Universe, and there were numerous more radio sources than at present, resulted in the failure of this theory and universal acceptance of the Big Bang Theory. Evgeny Lifshitz and Isaak Markovich Khalatnikov also tried to find an alternative to the Big Bang theory but also failed. Roger Penrose used light cones and general relativity to prove that a collapsing star could result in a region of zero size and infinite density and curvature called a Black Hole. Hawking and Penrose proved together that the Universe should have arisen from a singularity, which Hawking himself disproved once quantum effects are taken into account. === Chapter 4: The Uncertainty Principle === In this chapter, Hawking first discusses nineteenth-century French mathematician Laplace's strong belief in scientific determinism, where scientific laws will eventually be able to accurately predict the future of the Universe. Then he discusses the theory of infinite radiation of stars according to the calculations of British scientists Lord Rayleigh and James Jeans, which was later revised in 1900 by German scientist Max Planck who suggested that energy must radiate in small, finite packets called quanta. Hawking then discusses the uncertainty principle formulated by German scientist Werner Heisenberg, according to which the speed and the position of a particle cannot be precisely known due to Planck's quantum hypothesis: increasing the accuracy in measuring its speed will decrease the certainty of its position and vice versa. This disproved Laplace's idea of a completely deterministic theory of the universe. Hawking then describes the eventual development of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg, Austrian physicist Erwin Schroedinger and English physicist Paul Dirac in the 1920s, a theory which introduced an irreducible element of unpredictability into science, and despite German scientist Albert Einstein's strong objections, it has been proven to be very successful in describing the universe except for gravity and large-scale structures. Hawking then discusses how Heisenberg's uncertainty principle implies the wave–particle duality behaviour of light (and particles in general). He then describes the phenomenon of interference where multiple light waves interfere with each other to give rise to a single light wave with properties different from those of the component waves, as well as the interference within particles, exemplified by the two-slit experiment. Hawking writes how interference refined our understanding of the structure of atoms, the building blocks of matter. While Danish scientist Niels Bohr's theory only partially solved the problem of collapsing electrons, quantum mechanics completely resolved it. According to Hawking, American scientist Richard Feynman's sum over histories is a nice way of visualizing the wave-particle duality. Finally, Hawking mentions that Einstein's general theory of relativity is a classical, non- quantum theory which ignores the uncertainty principle and that it has to be reconciled with quantum theory in situations where gravity is very strong, such as black holes and the Big Bang. === Chapter 5: Elementary Particles and Forces of Nature === In this chapter, Hawking traces the history of investigation about the nature of matter: Aristotle's four elements, Democritus's notion of indivisible atoms, John Dalton's ideas about atoms combining to form molecules, J. J. Thomson's discovery of electrons inside atoms, Ernest Rutherford's discovery of atomic nucleus and protons, James Chadwick's discovery of neutrons and finally Murray Gell-Mann's work on even smaller quarks which make up protons and neutrons. Hawking then discusses the six different "flavors" (up, down, strange, charm, bottom, and top) and three different "colors" of quarks (red, green, and blue). Later in the chapter he discusses anti-quarks, which are outnumbered by quarks due to the expansion and cooling of the Universe. Hawking then discusses the spin property of particles, which determines what a particle looks like from different directions. Hawking then discusses two groups of particles in the Universe based on their spin: fermions and bosons. Fermions, with a spin of 1/2, follow the Pauli exclusion principle, which states that they cannot share the same quantum state (for example, two "spin up" protons cannot occupy the same location in space). Without this rule, complex structures could not exist. Bosons or the force-carrying particles, with a spin of 0, 1, or 2, do not follow the exclusion principle. Hawking then gives the examples of virtual gravitons and virtual photons. Virtual gravitons, with a spin of 2, carry the force of gravity. Virtual photons, with a spin of 1, carry the electromagnetic force. Hawking then discusses the weak nuclear force (responsible for radioactivity and affecting mainly fermions) and the strong nuclear force carried by the particle gluon, which binds quarks together into hadrons, usually neutrons and protons, and also binds neutrons and protons together into atomic nuclei. Hawking then writes about the phenomenon called color confinement which prevents the discovery of quarks and gluons on their own (except at extremely high temperature) as they remain confined within hadrons. Hawking writes that at extremely high temperature, the electromagnetic force and weak nuclear force behave as a single electroweak force, giving rise to the speculation that at even higher temperatures, the electroweak force and strong nuclear force would also behave as a single force. Theories which attempt to describe the behaviour of this "combined" force are called Grand Unified Theories, which may help us explain many of the mysteries of physics that scientists have yet to solve. === Chapter 6: Black Holes === In this chapter, Hawking discusses black holes, regions of spacetime where extremely strong gravity prevents everything, including light, from escaping from within them. Hawking describes how most black holes are formed during the collapse of massive stars (at least 25 times heavier than the Sun) approaching end of life. He writes about the event horizon, the black hole's boundary from which no particle can escape to the rest of spacetime. Hawking then discusses non- rotating black holes with spherical symmetry and rotating ones with axisymmetry. Hawking then describes how astronomers discover a black hole not directly, but indirectly, by observing with special telescopes the powerful X-rays emitted when it consumes a star. Hawking ends the chapter by mentioning his famous bet made in 1974 with American physicist Kip Thorne in which Hawking argued that black holes did not exist. Hawking lost the bet as new evidence proved that Cygnus X-1 was indeed a black hole. === Chapter 7: Black Holes Ain't So Black === This chapter discusses an aspect of black hole behaviors' that Stephen Hawking discovered in the 1970s. According to earlier theories, black holes can only become larger, and never smaller, because nothing which enters a black hole can come out. However, in 1974, Hawking published a new theory which argued that black holes can "leak" radiation. He imagined what might happen if a pair of virtual particles appeared near the edge of a black hole. Virtual particles briefly 'borrow' energy from spacetime itself, then annihilate with each other, returning the borrowed energy and ceasing to exist. However, at the edge of a black hole, one virtual particle might be trapped by the black hole while the other escapes. Because of the second law of thermodynamics, particles are 'forbidden' from taking energy from the vacuum. Thus, the particle takes energy from the black hole instead of from the vacuum, and escape from the black hole as Hawking radiation. According to Hawking, black holes must very slowly shrink over time and eventually "evaporate" because of this radiation, rather than continue existing forever as scientists had previously believed. === Chapter 8: The Origin and Fate of the Universe === thumb|right|400px|The Big Bang and the evolution of the Universe The beginning and the end of the universe are discussed in this chapter. Most scientists agree that the Universe began in an expansion called the "Big Bang". At the start of the Big Bang, the Universe had an extremely high temperature, which prevented the formation of complex structures like stars, or even very simple ones like atoms. During the Big Bang, a phenomenon called "inflation" took place, in which the Universe briefly expanded ("inflated") to a much larger size. Inflation explains some characteristics of the Universe that had previously greatly confused researchers. After inflation, the universe continued to expand at a slower pace. It became much colder, eventually allowing for the formation of such structures. Hawking also discusses how the Universe might have appeared differently if it grew in size slower or faster than it actually has. For example, if the Universe expanded too slowly, it would collapse, and there would not be enough time for life to form. If the Universe expanded too quickly, it would have become almost empty. Hawking ultimately proposes the conclusion that the universe might be finite, but boundless. In other words, it may have no beginning nor ending in time, but merely exist with a finite amount of matter and energy. The concept of quantum gravity is also discussed in this chapter. === Chapter 9: The Arrow of Time === In this chapter Hawking talks about why "real time", as Hawking calls time as humans observe and experience it (in contrast to "imaginary time", which Hawking claims is inherent to the laws of science) seems to have a certain direction, notably from the past towards the future. Hawking then discusses three "arrows of time" which, in his view, give time this property. Hawking's first arrow of time is the thermodynamic arrow of time: the direction in which entropy (which Hawking calls disorder) increases. According to Hawking, this is why we never see the broken pieces of a cup gather themselves together to form a whole cup. Hawking's second arrow is the psychological arrow of time, whereby our subjective sense of time seems to flow in one direction, which is why we remember the past and not the future. Hawking claims that our brain measures time in a way where disorder increases in the direction of time – we never observe it working in the opposite direction. In other words, he claims that the psychological arrow of time is intertwined with the thermodynamic arrow of time. Hawking's third and final arrow of time is the cosmological arrow of time: the direction of time in which the Universe is expanding rather than contracting. According to Hawking, during a contraction phase of the universe, the thermodynamic and cosmological arrows of time would not agree. Hawking then claims that the "no boundary proposal" for the universe implies that the universe will expand for some time before contracting back again. He goes on to argue that the no boundary proposal is what drives entropy and that it predicts the existence of a well-defined thermodynamic arrow of time if and only if the universe is expanding, as it implies that the universe must have started in a smooth and ordered state that must grow toward disorder as time advances. He argues that, because of the no boundary proposal, a contracting universe would not have a well-defined thermodynamic arrow and therefore only a Universe which is in an expansion phase can support intelligent life. Using the weak anthropic principle, Hawking goes on to argue that the thermodynamic arrow must agree with the cosmological arrow in order for either to be observed by intelligent life. This, in Hawking's view, is why humans experience these three arrows of time going in the same direction. === Chapter 10: Wormholes and Time Travel === In this chapter, Hawking discusses whether it is possible to time travel, i.e., travel into the future or the past. He shows how physicists have attempted to devise possible methods by humans with advanced technology may be able to travel faster than the speed of light, or travel backwards in time, and these concepts have become mainstays of science fiction. Einstein–Rosen bridges were proposed early in the history of general relativity research. These "wormholes" would appear identical to black holes from the outside, but matter which entered would be relocated to a different location in spacetime, potentially in a distant region of space, or even backwards in time. However, later research demonstrated that such a wormhole, even if possible for it to form in the first place, would not allow any material to pass through before turning back into a regular black hole. The only way that a wormhole could theoretically remain open, and thus allow faster-than-light travel or time travel, would require the existence of exotic matter with negative energy density, which violates the energy conditions of general relativity. As such, almost all physicists agree that faster-than- light travel and travel backwards in time are not possible. Hawking also describes his own "chronology protection conjecture", which provides a more formal explanation for why faster-than-light and backwards time travel are almost certainly impossible. === Chapter 11: The Unification of Physics === Quantum field theory (QFT) and general relativity (GR) describe the physics of the Universe with astounding accuracy within their own domains of applicability. However, these two theories contradict each other. For example, the uncertainty principle of QFT is incompatible with GR. This contradiction, and the fact that QFT and GR do not fully explain observed phenomena, have led physicists to search for a theory of "quantum gravity" that is both internally consistent and explains observed phenomena just as well as or better than existing theories do. Hawking is cautiously optimistic that such a unified theory of the Universe may be found soon, in spite of significant challenges. At the time the book was written, "superstring theory" had emerged as the most popular theory of quantum gravity, but this theory and related string theories were still incomplete and had yet to be proven in spite of significant effort (this remains the case as of 2021). String theory proposes that particles behave like one-dimensional "strings", rather than as dimensionless particles as they do in QFT. These strings "vibrate" in many dimensions. Instead of 3 dimensions as in QFT or 4 dimensions as in GR, superstring theory requires a total of 10 dimensions. The nature of the six "hyperspace" dimensions required by superstring theory are difficult if not impossible to study, leaving countless theoretical string theory landscapes which each describe a universe with different properties. Without a means to narrow the scope of possibilities, it is likely impossible to find practical applications for string theory. Alternative theories of quantum gravity, such as loop quantum gravity, similarly suffer from a lack of evidence and difficulty to study. Hawking thus proposes three possibilities: 1) there exists a complete unified theory that we will eventually find; 2) the overlapping characteristics of different landscapes will allow us to gradually explain physics more accurately with time and 3) there is no ultimate theory. The third possibility has been sidestepped by acknowledging the limits set by the uncertainty principle. The second possibility describes what has been happening in physical sciences so far, with increasingly accurate partial theories. Hawking believes that such refinement has a limit and that by studying the very early stages of the Universe in a laboratory setting, a complete theory of Quantum Gravity will be found in the 21st century allowing physicists to solve many of the currently unsolved problems in physics. === Conclusion === In this final chapter, Hawking summarises the efforts made by humans through their history to understand the Universe and their place in it: starting from the belief in anthropomorphic spirits controlling nature, followed by the recognition of regular patterns in nature, and finally with the scientific advancement in recent centuries, the inner workings of the universe have become far better understood. He recalls the suggestion of the nineteenth-century French mathematician Laplace that the Universe's structure and evolution could eventually be precisely explained by a set of laws whose origin is left in God's domain. However, Hawking states that the uncertainty principle introduced by the quantum theory in the twentieth century has set limits to the predictive accuracy of future laws to be discovered. Hawking comments that historically, the study of cosmology (the study of the origin, evolution, and end of Earth and the Universe as a whole) has been primarily motivated by a search for philosophical and religious insights, for instance, to better understand the nature of God, or even whether God exists at all. However, for Hawking, most scientists today who work on these theories approach them with mathematical calculation and empirical observation, rather than asking such philosophical questions. In his mind, the increasingly technical nature of these theories have caused modern cosmology to become increasingly divorced from philosophical discussion. Hawking nonetheless expresses hope that one day everybody would talk about these theories in order to understand the true origin and nature of the Universe, and accomplish "the ultimate triumph of human reasoning". == Editions == * 1988: The first edition included an introduction by Carl Sagan that tells the following story: Sagan was in London for a scientific conference in 1974, and between sessions he wandered into a different room, where a larger meeting was taking place. "I realized that I was watching an ancient ceremony: the investiture of new fellows into the Royal Society, one of the most ancient scholarly organizations on the planet. In the front row, a young man in a wheelchair was, very slowly, signing his name in a book that bore on its earliest pages the signature of Isaac Newton ... Stephen Hawking was a legend even then." In his introduction, Sagan goes on to add that Hawking is the "worthy successor" to Newton and Paul Dirac, both former Lucasian Professors of Mathematics. The introduction was removed after the first edition, as it was copyrighted by Sagan, rather than by Hawking or the publisher, and the publisher did not have the right to reprint it in perpetuity. Hawking wrote his own introduction for later editions. * 1994, A brief history of time – An interactive adventure. A CD-Rom with interactive video material created by S. W. Hawking, Jim Mervis, and Robit Hairman (available for Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, and Windows XP).A brief history of time – An interactive adventure * 1996, Illustrated, updated and expanded edition: This hardcover edition contained full-color illustrations and photographs to help further explain the text, as well as the addition of topics that were not included in the original book. * 1998, Tenth- anniversary edition: It features the same text as the one published in 1996, but was also released in paperback and has only a few diagrams included. * 2005, A Briefer History of Time: a collaboration with Leonard Mlodinow of an abridged version of the original book. It was updated again to address new issues that had arisen due to further scientific development. == Film == In 1991, Errol Morris directed a documentary film about Hawking, but although they share a title, the film is a biographical study of Hawking, and not a filmed version of the book. == Apps == "Stephen Hawking's Pocket Universe: A Brief History of Time Revisited" is based on the book. The app was developed by Preloaded for Transworld publishers, a division of the Penguin Random House group. The app was produced in 2016. It was designed by Ben Courtney (now of Lego) and produced by video game production veteran Jemma Harris (now of Sony) and is available on iOS only. == Opera == The Metropolitan Opera commissioned an opera to premiere in the 2015–2016 season based on Hawking's book. It was to be composed by Osvaldo Golijov with a libretto by Alberto Manguel in a production by Robert Lepage. The planned opera was changed to be about a different subject and eventually canceled completely. == See also == *Turtles all the way down – a jocular expression of the infinite regress problem in cosmology that appears in Hawking's book * *List of textbooks on classical mechanics and quantum mechanics *List of textbooks in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics *Hawking Index – a mock mathematical measurement of how far people will read a book before giving up, named in reference to Hawking's book. == References == == External links == * Photos of the first edition of A Brief History of Time Category:1988 non-fiction books Category:Books by Stephen Hawking Category:English-language books Category:Popular physics books Category:Cosmology books Category:Bantam Books books
1443000	A Brief History of Time (film)	A Brief History of Time is a 1991 biographical documentary film about the physicist Stephen Hawking, directed by Errol Morris. The title derives from Hawking's bestselling 1988 book A Brief History of Time, but, whereas the book is solely an explanation of cosmology, the film is also a biography of Hawking, featuring interviews with some of his family members and colleagues. The film is scored by frequent Morris collaborator Philip Glass. ==Production== This project originated with executive producer Gordon Freedman, who brought the it to Anglia Television. After acquiring the property, Freedman met with director Steven Spielberg for advice on how to make the project into an documentary film. Spielberg suggested Errol Morris as director. Morris had studied the history and philosophy of science at Princeton and later Berkeley, so was familiar with many of the topics in Hawking's book. Freedman's production company partnered with Anglia Television and Tokyo Broadcasting. David Hickman, of Anglia, became the film's producer. Morris only had a few days of access to film and interview Hawking. Because of Hawking's ALS, a disease that progressively affects nerve cells within the spine and brain, Morris filmed various static shots of Hawking, his wheelchair, and the tools he used to communicate, such as his battery-powered computer-based communication system with an electronic voicebox (which was sponsored and provided by Intel Corporation), to later edit together for the video component of Hawking's interview segments in the film. Although Hawking had an aversion to featuring his personal life in the film, Morris saw A Brief History of Time as being as much a biography as a science text, and much of his directing and editing work was dedicated to finding ways to depict ideas from theoretical physics and cosmology and then connect those ideas with details from the life of Hawking. He employed stylized interview sequences, graphic illustrations, and music written by Glass. Morris also included clips from Disney's The Black Hole (1979). Instead of Morris traveling around and filming the various interview subjects in their native surroundings, all of the interviews for this film were shot on specially built sets on a sound stage in England. Morris said he was "very moved by Hawking as a man", calling him "immensely likable, perverse, funny...and yes, he's a genius." He remembers that Hawking had posters of Marilyn Monroe in his office, and one of them fell down while they were filming. "A fallen woman", Hawking's speech synthesizer intoned. Hawking's mother, Isobel, is the first person we hear from in the movie, and near the end she describes her son as "a seeker" for truth. After the movie premiered, Hawking told Morris, "Thank you for making my mother a star." == List of interviewees == (in order of appearance) * Isobel Hawking, Hawking's mother * Janet Humphrey, Hawking's aunt * Mary Hawking, Hawking's sister * Basil King, neighbor of the Hawkings * Derek Powney, classmate of Hawking at Oxford * Norman Dix, classmate of Hawking at Oxford * Robert Berman, tutor of Hawking at Oxford * Gordon Berry, classmate of Hawking at Oxford * Roger Penrose, mathematical physicist who worked with Hawking on Penrose-Hawking singularity theorems * Dennis Sciama, cosmologist and PhD supervisor for Hawking * John Wheeler, theoretical physicist who coined the phrase "black hole" * Brandon Carter, physicist * John Taylor, physicist * Kip Thorne, astrophysicist and friend of Hawking * Don Page, theoretical physicist, doctoral student of Hawking *Christopher Isham, physicist * Brian Whitt, physicist and editor of Hawking's A Brief History of Time * Raymond Laflamme, theoretical physicist, doctoral student of Hawking ==Music== The soundtrack for A Brief History of Time was composed by Philip Glass. Morris says he had Glass compose the score before showing him the movie; instead, he would give him relevant cues like "falling into a black hole" or "event horizon." ===Soundtrack=== ==Reception== A Brief History of Time received largely positive reviews. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 93% rating based on 15 reviews. On Metacritic, the film has a 78 out of 100 rating based on 12 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". ==Availability== The film was released on VHS in the early 1990s, but remained unreleased on DVD or Blu-ray until The Criterion Collection issued a release on April 15, 2014. ==See also== * List of films about mathematicians ==References== ==External links== * * * * * A Brief History of Time from ErrolMorris.com *A Brief History of Time: Macrobiography an essay by David Sterritt at the Criterion Collection Category:1991 films Category:Films with atheism-related themes Category:1990s biographical films Category:1991 documentary films Category:American biographical films Category:American documentary films Category:Biographical films about mathematicians Category:British biographical films Category:British documentary films Category:Japanese biographical films Category:Japanese documentary films Category:Biographical documentary films Category:Documentary films about mathematics Category:Documentary films about science Category:Films shot at EMI-Elstree Studios Category:Films scored by Philip Glass Category:Films directed by Errol Morris Category:Films shot in Cambridgeshire Category:Films shot in Hertfordshire Category:Stephen Hawking Category:1990s English-language films Category:1990s American films Category:1990s British films Category:1990s Japanese films Category:Films about physicists Category:Sundance Film Festival award-winning films
21004590	A Brief History of the Future	A Brief History of the Future is a speculative futurology book about the next 50 years by Jacques Attali. The original edition was published by Fayard in 2006. == Themes == === History === The first third of the book retraces Human history from prehistory to today, with an emphasis on the rise of capitalism around 1200. It describes Dumézil's three Orders (religious, military and economic) as the "ritual order", the "imperial order" and the "merchant order", noting that the "merchant order" came to supersede the two others. The book hypothesizes that "merchant order" went through nine successive geographical "cores" associated with a characteristic technology. The core cities were: # Bruges with the central rudder stock (1200–1350) # Venice with the caravel (1350–1500) # Antwerp with printing (1500–1560) # Genoa and accounting (1560–1620) # Amsterdam with the fluyt (1620–1788) # London and the steam engine (1788–1890) # Boston and the piston engine (1890–1929) # New York City with the electric engine (1929–1980) # Los Angeles and the microchip (1980–present) A city would then become a "core" when it able to transform a service into an industrial product. The close vicinity becomes the "environment", and the rest of the world becomes the "periphery". === Speculation === ==== Fall of the US empire ==== The speculation as to how the future will unfold begins one third into the book, which predicts the fall of the US Empire before the end of the ninth form of capitalism, estimated to take place around 2035. It would be followed by a polycentric world, with nine dominating nations on all continents: the United States, Brazil, Mexico, China, India, Russia, the European Union, Egypt and Nigeria. Some of them, notably China, India and Nigeria, as well as other countries artificially created after colonization, could undertake an explosion process similar to that of USSR in 1991, with as many as 100 new countries emerging. Japan, Indonesia, Korea, Australia, Canada and South Africa would also play important roles as major regional powers. A process of "nomadisation" would stem from technological factors, like the Internet; from demographic factors, like aging of developed populations which would entail massive immigration from Southern countries to pay retirements; and from development of megapoles. Increase of world population would entail a doubling of global farming production. Urbanisation would make forest disappear everywhere, except for Europe and Northern America where artificially maintained ones would subsist. This would cause further increases of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and accelerate global warming. Consecutive droughts would make water a rare resource, and greatly reduce biodiversity. ==== Hyperempire ==== The "nomadisation" process would make nation-States irrelevant, transforming the world into a chaotic market called "hyperempire". The entire planet would work according to an ultra-liberal economy and a form of democracy with "revisited" standards. The citizens would see themselves as "global citizens" who want their work to serve a "higher purpose". The ruling class, called "hypernomads", would ground its power on a middle class of 4 billion "virtual nomads" comprising technicians, scientists, managers, engineers, etc. The "virtual nomads" would live a sedentary life, but work in networks for companies without a central location. 3.5 billion "infranomads" would subsist in misery. "Infranomads" are expected to revolt violently against their condition, stemming a resurgence of national entities and crystallising conflicts around traditional borders of ethnicities, religions, etc. Technological improvements in weaponry would put Humanity at risk of destroying itself in this conflict. ==== Hyperdemocracy ==== Opportunities of more constructive developments are detailed under the term "Hyperdemocracy", based on solidarity networks, participative democracy, "responsible companies", NGOs, micro-credits and collective intelligence. === Present day === The end of the book details reforms defended by Attali for present France, as a partial remedy to her decline which threatens her ability to survive to the competition of the "hypermarket". ==Reception== A review in The Guardian complimented Attali's book but also said that "the author's prose is burdened by a habit of self-congratulation". ==References== Category:2006 essays Category:Futurology books Category:English-language books

54654955	A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships	A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships is the third studio album by English band the 1975. It was released on 30 November 2018 by Dirty Hit and Polydor Records. Initially titled Music for Cars, the album was intended as the follow-up to I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It (2016). The term later denoted an era encompassing both their third album and Notes on a Conditional Form, released in 2020. The band halted recording of the first part after lead singer Matty Healy left for a drug rehabilitation clinic in Barbados, seeking treatment for his heroin addiction. Following the singer's return, the band spent several months completing the album in Northamptonshire and Los Angeles. A maximalist experimental album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships combines rock and pop music with ambient interludes. Eschewing the 1980s-influenced sound of its predecessor, the album embraces a desolate soundscape informed by electronica. Noted for its incorporation of various genres, the record heavily draws from jazz, R&B;, electropop, indie rock and Britpop, among others. The songs are characterised by their electronic beats, gospel choirs, neo-soul horns and downtempo rhythms. Guest contributions are featured from the London Community Gospel Choir, No Rome, the Japanese House and Roy Hargrove. Exploring the role of digital communication and the internet in contemporary life, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships is a concept album connected by several overarching threads. The album serves as a cautionary political statement, questioning the implications of society's relationship with technology and its impact on millennials. It marks a shift in Healy's portrayal of heroin addiction, embracing sincerity and honesty to speak on the desolation it causes. Eschewing metaphors and ambiguity, the album utilises black humour, simple lyrics and straightforward storytelling, covering dark topics such as nihilism, suicide, depression, anxiety, dissociation, trauma, cynicism and death, among others. The album received widespread acclaim from contemporary music critics, who praised the production quality and portrayal of modern life, with some critics calling it a millennial version of Radiohead's OK Computer. It was preceded by the singles "Give Yourself a Try", "Love It If We Made It", "TooTimeTooTimeTooTime", "Sincerity Is Scary" and "It's Not Living (If It's Not with You)". In addition to appearing on numerous publications' year-end and decade-end lists, it won the British Album of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards. The album became the 1975's third consecutive number one on the UK Albums Chart, and was later certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It also peaked at number four on the US Billboard 200 chart and attained top-ten positions in several countries, including on Ireland, New Zealand and Australia. To further promote the album, the band embarked on their Music for Cars Tour. == Background == The 1975 released their second studio album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It, in February 2016. The record peaked atop the UK Albums Chart and the US Billboard 200 and was considered by numerous critics to be one of the best albums of 2016. In February 2017, lead singer Matthew Healy tweeted: "Music For Cars – 2018". In an April interview on Zane Lowe's Beats 1 Radio show, the singer confirmed the title Music For Cars and announced a 2018 release, saying "[the album] has always been called that, and we were always gonna do a trilogy of records". He later told Tom Connick of NME that the title was a reference to the band's third extended play of the same name (2013), saying it "was always my favorite title of everything we'd ever done". With Music For Cars, the singer aimed to create the most important pop album of the decade, hoping to achieve the same impact as Radiohead's OK Computer (1997) and the Smiths' The Queen Is Dead (1986). In August 2017, the 1975 stated they were in the editing process of Music For Cars, having over two hours worth of material, while the band's manager Jamie Oborne said the first recording sessions for the album were planned for September. Posters promoting the album began emerging around London and Manchester in April 2018. In May, the 1975 announced that Music For Cars would now serve as an umbrella term to denote an "era" comprising two albums: A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships and Notes on a Conditional Form (2020). The title of the former is taken from Gene McHugh's essay The Context of the Digital: A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. While on a train in London, Healy spotted a passenger reading You Are Here: Art After the Internet by Omar Kholeif, in which the essay is included. Regarding the decision to release two separate bodies of work rather than a double album, Healy called the double album format "prog and annoying... they're self-serving". == Recording and development == In July 2017, the 1975's drummer and co-producer George Daniel discovered Healy was using heroin again, only hours before performing at the Latitude Festival. The band held an intervention afterward, and the singer promised to detox once they traveled to Los Angeles to record A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships. The initial recording sessions began in August at the Angelic Residential Recording Studio in Northamptonshire. In September, the singer went on a tirade while under the influence of benzodiazepine, proclaiming he would continue to smoke heroin while telling the band members: "Listen, everyone has to get onboard because I'm the fucking main deal. If you want songs, we're just going to have to get on with it." Realising the seriousness of his actions, Healy declared his intention to enter a drug rehabilitation centre and treat his heroin addiction. The 1975 travelled to Los Angeles the following month, recording at the Sunset Marqui until Halloween, when Healy left to seek treatment at a rehab in Barbados. Healy spent seven weeks in Barbados between November and December, an experience which inspired several songs on A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships; he used songwriting as a means of catharsis that allowed him to gain a sense of purpose and wellbeing. The singer wrote "Surrounded by Heads and Bodies" about Angela, a woman he met in rehab. Although the pair rarely interacted, he felt a connection with her, and a later conversation revealed they lived on the same street in Manchester. The song's title stems from David Foster Wallace's Infinite Jest (1996), which Healy read during his time in Barbados. "I Couldn't Be More In Love" was also inspired by the experience, with the singer saying it is "not about love at all", but rather explores "being terrified of what happens when people stop caring". Healy and Daniel remained in contact during his time in rehab, which represented the longest time the two had spent apart, and the latter said: "It was a worrying time, because we’re so symbiotic, there can’t be problems like that." While much of A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships was written prior to Healy's stay in Barbados, the 1975 returned to the Northamptonshire studio in January 2018, where they remained for seven months. The singer told Indran Paramasivam of Bandwagon that the studio was chosen due to its seclusion and resemblance to his childhood farmhouse in Cheshire. Elsewhere in the UK, the band recorded sessions at various studios in London, including Abbey Road Studios with the London Community Gospel Choir. In late July, the 1975 returned to Los Angeles for four months to finalise the record and start working on Notes on a Conditional Form. Although the band worked on both albums simultaneously, Healy did not want to preserve any songs for Notes on a Conditional Form. During this period, the band lived and worked at Perfect Sound, a residential recording studio. Unlike the 1975's prior albums, it is the first not to be co-produced by Mike Crossey. Healy said that Crossey helped the band build confidence as producers with their first two albums; teaching them how to use a studio, how to record and guide the development their craft. Owing to the variety of recording locations utilised for A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, Healy felt that it was not "really conducive to have another element in there". == Musical style == A musically experimental album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships combines rock and pop music. Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone said its juxtaposition of various genres mirrors a music streaming playlist where "sophistipop fades into jazz fades into big-ticket MOR fades into Quiet Storm". The Daily Telegraphs Neil McCormick observed a "kaleidoscopic" variety of styles that reflects the album's engagement with contemporary culture and noted the presence of aesthetically unifying lyrical, vocal and instrumental factors. Writing that the record combines a "strange" mix of tones, genres and production into a singular aesthetic, Mike Watkins of Clash opined that it continues the experimental progression of I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It. Writing for The Skinny, Harry Harris noted "a lot more lush, Postal Service-y electronica, and dreamy, cinematic collage-like phrases and choices", deeming the music a departure from the 1980s-style of the record's predecessor. Claire Biddles from The Line of Best Fit also felt the album is a musical departure from the band's second record, asserting that it eschews the "sunset pinks" and "pool blues" of their second album in favour of "a desolate sonic world". Chris Conaton of PopMatters, The Ringer's editorial staff and NME writer Dan Stubbs deemed the record "genre-hopping". Aimee Cliff of Dazed deemed it "an effervescent and experimental record", while Tampa Bay Times writer Jay Cridlin called the album a "lavish and experimental blockbuster". Writing for Paste, Marissa Matazzo said the album blends indie rock and electronic elements, while Conrad Duncan of Under the Radar classified the record as indie rock which incorporates jazz-rap, pop-reggaeton, "Gershwin balladry", IDM and Britpop. Thrillist writer Dan Jackson felt the album is rooted in electropop and R&B;, with Ian Gormely of Exclaim! also calling it an electropop album. Sputnikmusic staff writer SowingSeason classified the album's musical style as a fusion of jazz, electronica, rock and pop, with Andrew Sacher of BrooklynVegan calling the use of the former genre "the most surprising twist on [the] album". Interspersed with ambient interludes, the maximalist songs on A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships are characterised by spaced-out electronic beats and flourishes, gospel choirs, saxophones, neo-soul horns, light piano, 1980s synths, "jaunty" melodies and downtempo rhythms. Healy's vocals are autotuned and distorted for much of the record, and he delivers the lyrics in a stream-of-consciousness style. The album features contributions from several guest collaborators. The London Community Gospel Choir provides choir vocals on "Love It If We Made It", "Sincerity Is Scary", "It's Not Living (If It's Not with You)" and "I Couldn't Be More in Love". Roy Hargrove performs the trumpet on "Sincerity Is Scary" and "Mine". Guendoline Rome Viray Gomez—known professionally as No Rome—co- wrote "TooTimeTooTimeTooTime" and performs the song's background vocals, drums, synthesiser and programming. Elsewhere, he provides the keyboards and programming for "Sincerity Is Scary" and the background vocals on "I Like America & America Likes Me". Amber Bain–known professionally as the Japanese House–contributes to "It's Not Living (If It's Not with You)", singing the background vocals in addition to performing the keyboard and electric guitar. == Themes and lyrics == A concept album, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships explores digital communication and the internet's role in contemporary life. Several overarching narratives connect the record: society's relationship with technology, the millennial experience in the information age, and Healy's commitment to sincerity following the end of his heroin addiction. Healy compared the album to an essay meant to inform the listener without opinion or judgement, consciously avoiding portraying a dystopian society. The record eschews condescension and generalisation in an attempt to embrace contemporary life, utilising straightforward storytelling and simple lyrics that omit metaphors and ambiguity. Sacher observed a dark, conversational-style delivery that mimics a Twitter feed. For this reason, Cliff compared its structure to a newsfeed where "love and politics and comedy and culture all fight for attention". Rather than condemn and judge humanity's increasingly dependent relationship with technology, information and the internet, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships accepts their ubiquity and debates it by posing a series of new questions. The album questions whether honest interpersonal communication can survive in the digital era and examines trust in the internet age, the overstimulation of infinite content loops, confirmation bias, how people communicate with one another and the mania of the online world. Biddles opined that the album is "ostensibly about the internet's role in our lives", writing it continues the band's exploration of how people connect and what messages are lost through digital communications. Writing for Atwood Magazine, Sara Santora felt the record reflects the effects of social media addiction and the 24-hour news cycle on youth culture, causing millennials to be "constantly concerned with the state of our world". A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships attempts to document the millennial experience in the information age, serving as a cautionary political statement about modern society and contemporary existence. It avoids lambasting the "largely misunderstood generation", according to David Sackllah of Consequence, and instead showcases their achievement, wit and humanity. It reflects geopolitics, nihilism, ageing, the passage of time and the challenges faced by young people in society; searching for hope and authenticity, navigating life in a technologically advanced future, understanding their role in society, and their ability—or inability—to promote change. It also deals with the psychological impact of inheriting a global recession, climate change, xenophobia, the War On Terror, dying industries and society on the brink of collapse. Regarding the impact of these events on the album's themes and lyrics, Stereogums Ryan Leas said it depicts: "The static, the paralysis, the disenchantment, the fury, the dislocation, produced by a world that seems to be falling apart and the way the internet brings that right up to our faces constantly." Abandoning postmodern irony and embracing sincerity, A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships marks a definitive shift toward an honest dialogue about Healy's sobriety and recovery. Although reluctant to speak on his addiction, the singer did not want to romanticise or trivialise it and sought to avoid the "clichéd myth of the countercultural rebel junkie", using the lyrics to deter any fetishisation of his struggle. David Greene of NPR identified Healy's experience with heroin addiction and rehab as the album's "true focal point", while Biddles attributed the new commitment to sincerity to Healy's time in rehab. Throughout the album, Healy focuses on drug addiction and the desolation that it causes, using black humour to tell sordid stories that deal with millennial self-destruction. Writing for The Irish Times, Louise Bruton described the record as "[wandering] through the various darkened states of isolation until it finds faint glimmers of light to reach out for", covering dark subjects such as suicide, depression, anxiety, dissociation, trauma, disillusionment, self-loathing, cynicism and death. == Songs == A sparse ambient, folk and electronic instrumental, "The 1975", serves as the intro of A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships. "Give Yourself a Try", a lo-fi indie rock and post-punk song, encourages people to recognise their self-worth. Exploring how social media affects modern-day relationships, "TooTimeTooTimeTooTime" is an electropop and synth-pop track with a tropical house beat. Characterised by minimal lyrics which detail how Healy lied to his friends amid his addiction, "How to Draw / Petrichor" is a two-part experimental, electronica, ambient and UK garage interlude. The first part, "How to Draw", contains twinkling synths, a ringing music box, delicate embers of sound, an ethereal mixture of noises and a toy piano. It gradually builds, adding vocoded vocals before transitioning into the electro-industrial "Petrichor". The second half is built upon a dance beat and contains glitching electronics, a programmed drum beat, house-inspired vocals and elements of ska, before concluding with sparse piano chords in a techno outro. "Love It If We Made It" is an electro-rock ballad that deals with the vices of modern humanity, hypocrisy and disinformation. An acoustic song, "Be My Mistake", details unfaithfulness while on tour. "Sincerity Is Scary", the seventh song on A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, reflects on modern communication problems and valuing irony over honesty, and is composed as an experimental neo soul, R&B; and neo jazz ballad. Addressing gun control, "I Like America & America Likes Me" is an experimental electronic and alternative R&B; power ballad. Siri performs the album's ambient spoken word intermission, "The Man Who Married a Robot / Love Theme", a satirical poem about society's willingness to sacrifice human connection for virtual gratification. The cautionary tale focuses on a lonely internet troll named SnowflakeSmasher86, who retreats into the internet; his only friend. The man falls in love with the internet and later dies, with Siri saying, "You can find him on Facebook", and the song transitions into an orchestral theme. A torch song, "Inside Your Mind", is composed as a sparse post-rock, noise pop, indie rock and downtempo power ballad. The lyrics alternate between love and violence, describing a desire to know the thoughts of a romantic partner. A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationshipss 11th song, "It's Not Living (If It's Not with You)", is a pop, synth-rock and power pop track that draws parallels between heartbreak and addiction. "Surrounded by Heads and Bodies", an experimental indie rock and acoustic interlude, is a poem directed toward Angela that reflects upon Healy's time in rehab. Containing a stripped-back production, it has a loose composition that experiments with structure, eschewing a chorus in favour of a time-shifting drum beat. "Mine" is a jazz and lounge ballad which discusses a fear of commitment and fighting crime online, featuring brushed drums and a trumpet solo by Hargrove. A synth-pop, R&B; and soft rock slow jam, "I Couldn't Be More in Love" is a power ballad containing keyboards and a choral backing from the London Community Gospel Choir. Lyrically, the song addresses the co-dependence between the band and their fanbase. The album's final song, "I Always Wanna Die (Sometimes)" is an experimental Britpop power ballad that details Healy's struggles with suicidal thoughts and offers honest reasons why suicide is not the answer. == Release and promotion == The 1975 announced the release date of A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships and its tracklist on 10 September 2018. The band unveiled the album's artwork on social media the same day; it is a sparse and minimalist image containing tiny, colourful squares. Unlike the 1975's prior records, the artwork does not feature the band's signature rectangular box design. While some of the band's fanbase expressed their disappointment over its omission, Shahlin Graves of Coup de Main noted that various rectangles could be created by connecting the small squares. A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships was officially released by Dirty Hit and Polydor Records on 30 November 2018. To further promote the album, the 1975 embarked on the Music for Cars Tour. The UK and Ireland leg began in January 2019 and featured supporting acts No Rome and Pale Waves. Consisting of 22 shows, a North American leg of the tour began in Guadalajara on 20 March and concluded on 3 June in Toronto. Throughout the summer and fall of 2019, the band continued to perform throughout Europe, the Middle East and Oceania, beginning on 11 July in Trenčín and ending on 27 October in Perth. The 1975 returned to the US for a second leg of the tour, beginning in Camden on 16 November and concluding in Broomfield on 1 December. The planned second European leg of the Music for Cars Tour was postponed until October 2020 due to the band needing to complete the recording of Notes on a Conditional Form. It was deferred a second time to February 2021, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, while the third North American leg was suspended indefinitely. On 12 January 2021, the 1975 announced that the Music for Cars Tour would not resume. === Singles === "Give Yourself a Try" was released as the lead single from A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships on 31 May 2018.

An accompanying music video, depicting Healy and an array of people calmly singing the song's lyrics in front of different coloured backdrops, was released on 29 August 2018. The song was certified gold by the BPI, denoting sales of over 400,000 units in the UK. "Sincerity Is Scary" was released as the album's fourth single on 13 September. An accompanying music video, directed by Warren Fu, was released on 21 November. Inspired by classic musical films, the visual features numerous references and easter eggs related to the 1975's previous works. The video was met with a positive response and was deemed one of the best visuals of 2018 by Wonderland, Stereogum, NME, Billboard and HuffPost. The song was certified silver by the BPI. "It's Not Living (If It's Not with You)" was released as the album's fifth and final single on 18 October 2018. The song's music video, directed by Fu, was released on 13 December 2018.

Aggregating website Metacritic reports a normalised rating of 83, based on 29 critical reviews, indicating "universal acclaim". The website later ranked it as the 19th best-reviewed album of 2018. AnyDecentMusic? gave it 8.0 out of 10, based on their assessment of the critical consensus. In a perfect five- star review, Harris praised Daniel's "beautiful" production and the musical variation present throughout A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships, ultimately deeming it a "considered, ambitious album from a band who are constantly pushing themselves". Ross Horton of musicOMH similarly praised the album's ambition, saying: "Nobody makes things this brave anymore." Pitchforks Ryan Dombal highlighted the record's "boundless sense of style", writing that Daniel and Healy's production feels "more purposeful" than that of I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It. Gormely commended the 1975's ability to incorporate retro and contemporary influences to create music that sounds "new and familiar", and said their willingness to "fall flat on their face" distinguishes them from the "inoffensiveness of their pop peers". AllMusic's Matt Collar said the album's disparate sound works for individual songs, but as an album, it is "difficult to wade through as the social-media landscape it hopes to comment on". Conaton similarly dismissed the "scattershot" musical approach, writing the band "[throws] everything they can at the listener, and most of it just doesn’t stick". Awarding A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships a perfect five-star review, DIYs Will Richards deemed it a "bombastic, immaculately put together portrait of modern life", writing that the album's themes and lyrics transmit the feelings of youth culture. McCormick also commended Healy's songwriting, noting that the singer "easily [shifts] from witty sloganeering to tender confessional", while saying a "tone of urgent honesty pulses through the album, a visceral need to connect". Biddles lauded the record's exploration of relationships, writing that Healy displays "such a deep understanding of the small cruelties and vulnerabilities that punctuate our communication". Kitty Empire of The Observer praised the album for transforming "cliche-ridden topics" into "thoughtful" mainstream pop music. Describing the record as "stunning", Johnston highlighted its ability to portray important modern issues with humour and mournfulness, saying the album combines "fist-raising inspired by anthems with the gut-punch provided by precisely described longing". Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Mikael Wood wrote that despite being an "excellent [and] often thrilling" record that demonstrates Healy's understanding of such issues, the singer fails to recognise that he is "also more of a contributor than he likely realizes". A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships has frequently been referred to as a millennial version of OK Computer, with numerous critics drawing comparisons between the two records. Addressing the similarities in his review of the former album for The Boston Globe, Issac Feldberg felt it does not share the same sense of "doom and gloom" as OK Computer, and instead projects "its vision of life in the information age [as] too textured, too lived-in, to indulge the same shallow sanctimony that's hamstrung recent, analogous efforts by other artists". Hailing the record as "the millennial answer to OK Computer" in his perfect five-star review, Stubbs noted that OK Computer was created when the internet was seen as a "luxury", while four "digital natives" created a Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships. In his review of the album, Stephen Ackroyd of Dork declared it a "generation-defining masterpiece" reminiscent of both OK Computer and its followup Kid A (2000). When asked by Matt Wilkinson of Beats 1 Radio about the similarities, Healy said: "I'm so humbled. It's amazing but strange also." === Accolades === A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships placed 26th on Metacritic's list of the best-received albums of 2018, based on inclusions in mainstream publications' year-end lists. The album ranked at number 14 on The Village Voices annual Pazz & Jop mass critics' poll for 2018. A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships also placed eighth on Uproxx's 2018 mass critics' poll. Regarding reception from music audiences, NPR listeners voted the record as the 11th-most popular album of 2018. On Pitchforks 2018 Readers' Poll, the record was voted the 14th-best album of the year. A Brief Inquiry into Online Relationships won the award for British Album of the Year at the 2019 Brit Awards. The album was nominated for the 2019 Mercury Prize, which went to Dave's Psychodrama. Additionally, the record received a nomination for Best Album at the Q Awards.

44717146	A Brief Stop on the Road from Auschwitz	A Brief Stop on the Road from Auschwitz () is a 2012 book by Swedish author Göran Rosenberg, variously described as a novel and a non-fiction narrative book. As of 2014, the book has been translated into nine languages and sold more than 200,000 copies.Thomas Harding (4 December 2014) A history of violence: A Brief Stop on the Road from Auschwitz by Göran Rosenberg New Statesman. It won the August Prize in 2012 and the Prix du Meilleur Livre Étranger in 2014.Drago Jancar et Göran Rosenberg, prix du meilleur livre étranger 2014 Livres Hebdo. Retrieved 2 December 2014. == Synopsis == The book starts with a chapter called "The Place" in which, on 2 August 1947, a 24-year-old man arrives via train at the industrial town of Södertälje. He starts working at a lorry factory. Soon after a woman which the author refers to as my future mother joins the man. Originally from Łódź, Poland, the man and woman had started a relationship in the Łódź Ghetto, then been separated in the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp in 1944 and reunited in Alingsås before moving to Södertälje. They get an apartment and their first child is born; the latter is the author, who refers to himself as "the child". They name him Göran, the most common name in Sweden, and not after his Jewish grandfather, Gershon, and they start speaking to each other in Swedish perhaps to make him fit into the place. The chapter further focuses on "The Child"s experience in Södermanland, which is mostly positive. He learns to downplay his foreign background, and at one point, he writes with regard to one of his teachers, "I never let Mr. Winqvist find out that I knew a few words of Yiddish". The next chapters, called "The Wall", "The Carousel" and "The Road", recount the experience the man had in Auschwitz, as imagined by the author, informed by the historical record, in addition to the man's prior life in Poland, and general stories from Poland and Sweden during World War II. It ends with the man, now named David Rosenberg, arriving in Malmö on 18 July 1945.Rosenberg (2012), p. 141. The chapter "The Stop" describes David Rosenberg's early years in Sweden, as well the story of his wife, Hala Staw, during the war and afterwards in Poland. She arrives in Sweden in August 1946.Rosenberg (2012), p. 177. David travels to Łódź in 1958 and stays for three weeks, but finds the city depressing. He unsuccessfully seeks the graves of his father and other family members.Rosenberg (2012), p. 235. In 1956, David applies to Germany for economic compensation and is examined by Herbert Lindenbaum, a doctor representing Germany. The doctor partly doubts the veracity of David's claim and partly claims he is exaggerating his psychological problems. He describes Rosenberg as suffering from Rentenneurose [pension neurosis], a psychological sickness motivated by the wish for insurance benefits and the application is declined.Rosenberg (2012), p. 254-258. He makes a new application and in the following years several doctors, many saying that his ability to work is reduced by 60% due to psychological illness that can be related to the wartime experiences. A new doctor representing Germany, Herbert Lebram, concludes that his ability to work has been permanently reduced by 20%. On this basis, the application was again declined, as compensations required a minimum 25% reduction of working ability. The book recounts these important details exemplifying how in the 1950s postwar Germany further victimised, albeit not so to the same extent, Jewish Europeans it had already so wronged during the 1940s. Meanwhile, the health of David Rosenberg has deteriorated. He is on sick leave from his work due to depression from December 1959.Rosenberg (2012), p. 263. In April 1960, he becomes a patient at Sundby hospital in Strängnäs where he is treated for depression. He is given electroshock and medications but this is recounted briefly in the book rather than portrayed. On 22 July 1960, he commits suicide by drowning in a nearby lake.Rosenberg (2012), p. 278. Again, this is not elaborated in the text, but mentioned in an objective manner, and the reader is left to fill in the emotion attached to this fact. In a short afterword, Göran Rosenberg tells about his work writing the book. Throughout the book, the reader's attention is also drawn to the process of writing and the research and investigation behind that process. The book itself draws attention to the limits of knowledge about the past, as well as the importance of attempting to understand what happened. Thus it contributes to a sense of there being an ongoing process of coming to terms - each generation must find and write its Holocaust narratives. There is not one complete narrative of the Holocaust but a growing set of fragments that improve our grasp of what occurred during this most shameful era of European history and its immediate aftermath. ===Background, analysis and reviews === thumb|The author Göran Rosenberg While the book in Sweden was published as a documentary novel, it has in other countries been described as a non-fiction memoir. The book is based on the author's memories and research, as well as the memories of his mother Hala Rosenberg, sister Lillian Rosenberg-Roth and his cousins. Family members also provided documentation. Letters exchanged between the author's parents while Hala was in Poland and David in Sweden are quoted in the book as important background material, as are other family letters, including from Göran as a child. A few family photos are included, including one of Göran as a toddler with both his parents in front of an apartment building which is used on the cover of one edition. The book also makes use of medical records. In addition, the author uses Swedish and foreign public sources, like history books and old newspapers. As part of preparation for writing the book, Rosenberg traveled to Germany and Poland. The story of his parents is told through the voice of the author, who refers to himself as "The Child". Reviewers have described the book as just as much about the author Göran Rosenberg as about his father David Some reviewers also draw parallels between the scepticism and xenophobia that David Rosenberg experienced in postwar Europe with the experience of refugees in contemporary Sweden and Europe. The book received many positive reviews.Christina Patterson (23 November 2014) A life built on silence Sunday Times.

In a more critical review, Thomas Harding in New Statesman sees the book as a non-fiction narrative and finds that it relies too much on speculation. He writes that "Rosenberg's assertion of authorial integrity at the beginning of the book is undermined throughout. He does speculate; and then goes further, reproducing a novelist's description of life in a cattle cart, thus stepping into the world of fiction". Readers are invited by this narrative technique to consider how we reach an accurate depiction of past times and situations that are as vast and horrific as the Holocaust. ==References== ===Bibliography === * * First English translation by Sarah Death (London: Granta, 2014) . * Interview with the author Göran Rosenberg about this book: We are all on the road from Auschwitz *The author's webpage is here Category:2012 Swedish novels Category:Swedish-language novels Category:August Prize-winning works Category:Novels set in Sweden Category:Albert Bonniers Förlag books

25992182	A Bright Red Scream	A Bright Red Scream: Self-Mutilation and the Language of Pain is a 1998 non- fiction psychology book written by American journalist Marilee Strong about self-harm. Published by Viking Press, it is the first general interest book on self-harm. ==Background== In 1987, American psychiatrist Armando Favazza published Bodies Under Siege: Self-mutilation in Culture and Psychiatry, the first psychiatric text on the subject of self-harm. Marilee Strong was an American journalist who had spent several weeks in Mozambique on a Pulitzer Fellowship reporting on the psychological trauma experienced by children as a result of the civil war.A Bright Red Scream, p. xvii. When she returned to the United States, she heard about self-harm and decided to research the subject. In 1993, she wrote an article for San Francisco Focus entitled "A Bright Red Scream", part of a surge in media interest in the topic in the years following the publication of Favazza's book.Favazza, Armando. A Bright Red Scream (Introduction), p. xiii. Strong's was the first in-depth magazine article on self-harm and was the cover story for that issue. To research the book, she interviewed over 50 people who intentionally harm themselves, many of them by cutting. She also interviewed neuroscientists, psychologists and psychiatrists, including Favazza, a recognised expert on self-harm, and Bessel van der Kolk, a specialist in posttraumatic stress disorder.A Bright Red Scream, p. xvi. The title of the article and book came from an interview with a self-harmer who described the action of self-mutilation as a cry for help, calling it "a bright red scream".A Bright Red Scream, p. xviii. ==Subject== Millions of people in the United States regularly engage in self-harm, intentionally injuring themselves.A Bright Red Scream, p. xv Many of them use sharp objects such as knives, razors or broken glass to cut themselves. Strong set out to find the meaning behind this intentional self-harm, exploring related fields of research like child abuse, addiction and posttraumatic stress disorder. ==Critical reception== Charles R. Swenson reviewed the book for American Psychiatric Association journal Psychiatric Services. He called it "an illuminating and compassionate book" and said that the "greatest strength of this book is journalistic." Regarding Strong's focus on the childhood psychological trauma experienced by many cutters, he criticised her for neglecting "the nearly 50 percent of self-mutilating individuals who do not report trauma histories". Writing for Time, Tamala M. Edwards called it "a compelling tour of the trauma and science of self-injury". ==References== * Category:1998 non-fiction books Category:English-language books Category:Popular psychology books
2509621	A Bright Room Called Day	A Bright Room Called Day is a play by American playwright Tony Kushner, author of Angels in America. ==Synopsis== The play is set in Germany in 1932 and 1933, and concerns a group of friends caught up in the events of the fall of the Weimar Republic and the rise to power of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. The plot is centered on a woman named Agnes Eggling, a middle-aged actress, and all of the action takes place in her apartment. The action is occasionally interrupted by scenes featuring Zillah, a young woman in the 1980s living in Long Island who believes that Reagan is becoming too much like Hitler. In the version performed by the New York Shakespeare Festival, Zillah has moved to Berlin. Zillah has fled to Germany out of frustration and anger at the growing power of the Republican Party in America during the 1980s. The play was based on Bertolt Brecht's 1938 work The Private Life of the Master Race. ===2018 version=== Kushner revised the script in 2018 to include a new character, Xillah, who only interacts with Zillah. As explained by the character in the 2019 Public Theater production, A Bright Room Called Day was a play he wrote 34 years ago that never worked until Donald Trump was elected and suddenly everyone wanted to produce it, so he decided to give it an update. Xillah serves as Kushner's own commentary on his play, occasionally cutting into the proceedings to comment on issues with the play and getting into arguments with his "failed theatrical device" Zillah on the content of the play. Throughout the play, the two characters frequently discuss Kushner's prior comparison of Hitler to Ronald Reagan with present-day Hitler comparisons to Donald Trump. Zillah spends much of the play asking Xillah to write a new ending where she can interact with Agnes instead of having her just write hate mail to Ronald Reagan, while Xillah insists it is naïve to think one can speak to the dead. The result has been characterized by Kushner and Oskar Eustis (who directed the original Eureka production and the Public Theater revival) as turning the play from a critique of the American right to a discussion on the role of art as social or political action. ==Production history== A Bright Room Called Day was first presented in a workshop production by Heat & Light Co., Inc., at Theatre 22 in New York City in April 1985, directed by Kushner himself. The play premiered at the Eureka Theatre in San Francisco, California in October 1987, directed by Oskar Eustis. In January 1991, it was produced at the Joseph Papp Public Theater by the New York Shakespeare Festival, where it was directed by Michael Greif. The segments of the play set in the 1930s remained substantially the same throughout the various productions, but Zillah's interruptions changed drastically from version to version. Her scenes were the primary point of contention for critics of the show, some of whom took offense at her comparisons of Ronald Reagan to Adolf Hitler. In 2009, A Bright Room Called Day was translated into French by Hillary Keegin and Pauline Le Diset. It was presented by I Girasoli at the Théatre de la Boutonnière, Paris, France in January 2010 under the title Bright Room. In July to August 2014, the play got its first London revival at the Southwark Playhouse, directed by Sebastian Harcombe. In February 2018 a revised version of the play, titled "A Bright Room Called Day (Revisited)", was performed at the University of Southern California School of Dramatic Arts. The revised version included the addition of the character Xillah, who also interrupts the play and comments on the modern parallels of the play in contrast to the parallels made to 1985. The production was directed by David Warshofsky. Oskar Eustis helmed a revival of the play at the Public Theater in the fall of 2019, running from October 29 to December 22 after two extensions from an original end date of December 8. The production, using the revised version of the script, featured Nikki M. James as Agnes, Michael Urie as Gregor, Linda Emond as Annabella, Jonathan Hadary as Xillah, and Estelle Parsons as Die Älte, with Michael Esper as Vealtninc, Grace Gummer as Paulinka, Crystal Lucas-Perry as Zillah, Nadine Malouf as Rosa Malek, Mark Margolis as Gottfried Swetts, and Max Woertendyke as Emil Traum. Hayley Levitt of TheaterMania noted the revised script resembled a commentary on an old play rather than a revival of the play itself. ==Critics== * "Tony Kushner's A Bright Room Called Day...is unabashedly political, thought- provoking, a little scary, and frequently a good deal of theatrical fun. ...Bright Room is...an examination of Nazi Germany in an attempt to shed insight on our own time. It's brash, audacious, and, depending on your politics, anything from infuriatingly naive to intoxicatingly visionary. In its 1932-33 span, it tells of a group of Berlin artists and friends, with varying degrees of communist leanings, and of the changes in their lives as democracy falls and Adolph Hitler takes over." Sid Smith, Chicago Tribune * "It's fun to see a show this engaged. This passionate and ready to talk. Wild, uneven, pugnacious, ragged, committed, smart, dumb, satirical, and utterly serious. Always dramatically and intellectually forceful. And most important, always passionately committed. More than a diatribe against Reagan or a falling-into-the-Nazi-abyss history play, A Bright Room Called Day is an assertion of the need for commitment."

2033119	A Bright Shining Lie	A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam (1988) is a book by Neil Sheehan, a former New York Times reporter, about U.S. Army lieutenant colonel John Paul Vann (killed in action) and the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War. Sheehan was awarded the 1988 National Book Award for Nonfiction and the 1989 Pulitzer Prize for General Non-Fiction for the book."National Book Awards – 1988". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-02-20."General Nonfiction". Past winners & finalists by category. The Pulitzer Prizes. Retrieved 2012-03-25. It was adapted as a film of the same name released by HBO in 1998, starring Bill Paxton and Amy Madigan. ==Summary== John Paul Vann became an adviser to the Saigon regime in the early 1960s. He was an ardent critic of how the war was fought by the Saigon regime, which he viewed as corrupt and incompetent, and increasingly, on the part of the U.S. military. He was critical of the U.S. military command, especially under William Westmoreland and its inability to adapt to the fact that it was facing a popular guerrilla movement while backing a corrupt regime. He argued that many of the tactics employed (for example the Strategic Hamlet Program of relocation) further alienated the population and were counterproductive to U.S. objectives. He was often unable to influence the military command but used the Saigon press corps including Sheehan, David Halberstam and Malcolm Browne to disseminate his views. The prologue recounts Vann's funeral on June 16, 1972, after his death in a helicopter crash in Vietnam. Sheehan, a friend, had attended the funeral. The subsequent account is divided into seven "books" detailing Vann's career in Vietnam and America's involvement in the conflict. * Book I tells of Vann's assignment to Vietnam in 1962. * Book II "The Antecedents to a Confrontation" tells of the origin of the Vietnam War. * Book III gives a detailed account of the shambolic Battle of Ap Bac on January 2, 1963, in which the South Vietnamese army suffered a humiliating defeat at the hands of the Viet Cong. * Book IV details Vann's criticism of the way the war was being fought, his conflict with the U.S. military command and his transfer back to America. * Book V tracks back to give Vann's personal history before his involvement in the war, explaining how his career path to becoming a general officer was likely truncated by serial adulteries and the statutory rape of an Army chaplain's 15-year-old daughter. * Books VI and VII give an account of Vann's return to Vietnam in 1965 and his doomed attempt to implement a winning strategy for the U.S. Army and how he eventually compromised with the military system he once criticized. Sheehan describes Vann as having led more American troops in direct combat than any other civilian in US history. Vann had retired from the Army by then. ==Reception and influence== According to The New York Times Book Review, "If there is one book that captures the Vietnam war in the sheer Homeric scale of its passion and folly, this book is it. Neil Sheehan orchestrates a great fugue evoking all the elements of the war". The New York Review of Books proclaimed it "An unforgettable narrative, a chronicle grand enough to suit the crash and clangors of whole armies. A Bright Shining Lie is a very great piece of work; its rewards are aesthetic and [...] almost spiritual". It received the Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights 1989 Book Award given annually to a book that "most faithfully and forcefully reflects Robert Kennedy's purposes – his concern for the poor and the powerless, his struggle for honest and even-handed justice, his conviction that a decent society must assure all young people a fair chance, and his faith that a free democracy can act to remedy disparities of power and opportunity." In September, 1988, Sheehan was interviewed by Brian Lamb about A Bright Shining Lie. The discussion was aired on C-SPAN in five 30-minute segments and was the basis for the later C-SPAN show Booknotes. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Neil Sheehan (1988).

7595441	A Brighter Summer Day	A Brighter Summer Day is a 1991 Taiwanese epic teen crime drama film directed by Edward Yang, associated with the New Taiwanese Cinema. Its English title is derived from the lyrics of Elvis Presley's 1960 rendition of "Are You Lonesome Tonight?". Set in the late 1950s and early 1960s, the film centers on Xiao Si’r (Chang Chen), a boy from a middle-class home who veers into juvenile delinquency. The film was selected as the Taiwanese entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 64th Academy Awards but was not nominated.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences A Brighter Summer Day was ranked 78th in the 2022 Sight & Sound Greatest Films of All Time poll, one of four Chinese-language films to be included and above Yang's Yi Yi. ==Plot== Zhang Zhen (nickname Si'r), a junior high student in 1959 Taipei, is forced to attend night school after failing a test. This upsets his father, a career government worker, who is aware of and worried about the delinquency rampant among night school students. The next morning, Si'r and his father listen to a radio broadcast of distinguished students. In 1960, Si'r, along with his best friend, Cat, spy on an actress changing clothes during the filming of a drama in a movie studio. Caught by a guard, they steal his flashlight and flee back to school. Si'r, noticing movement in a darkened classroom, turns on the flashlight and startles a pair of lovers but does not see their faces. Two gangs, the Little Park Boys and their rivals the 217s, are introduced. Si'r is not a member of either gang but he is closer to the Little Park Boys. The Little Park Boys are led by Honey, who is hiding in Tainan from police after killing one of the 217s over his girlfriend, Ming. Sly leads the gang in his absence. Sly and Si'r become rivals after Si'r gets Sly in trouble, believing him and his girlfriend, Jade, to be the pair of lovers he saw. Meanwhile, Si'r and Ming meet by chance and become friends. Sly proposes a truce, arranging a concert with members from both gangs. Honey unexpectedly resurfaces and berates Sly for setting up the concert; however, he realizes the gang respects Sly more. The night before the concert, Honey "bequeaths" Ming to Si'r, believing him to be a stable boyfriend. The next night, Honey appears outside of the concert hall, antagonizing the 217s. Honey takes an ostensibly friendly walk with the 217's leader, Shandong, only to be killed when Shandong pushes him in front of an oncoming car. The Little Park Boys do not believe police reports that it is an accident, and plot revenge; they murder the 217s, including Shandong, during a typhoon, using weapons acquired by Ma, one of Si'r's wealthy classmates. Sly and the surviving Little Park Boys go into hiding. The same night, Si'r's father is arrested by secret police and interrogated about his past connections with the Chinese Communist Party. While eventually freed, he is demoted. Si'r starts dating Ming and seems to be improving academically. However, she reveals her flirtations with other boys, including an older doctor, bothering Si'r. The next day, Si'r is expelled after lashing out at the doctor and smashing a light bulb. He promises to pass his transfer exams to get into day school, upsetting Ming, who knows this means she will see him less. Later, Sly emerges from hiding and apologizes to Si'r for their past feud and reveals that Ming and Ma are dating. Upset, Si'r begins dating Jade, but he upsets her and she bitterly reveals that the girl he saw kissing Sly was Ming, not her. After threatening Ma at his home, Si'r steals Cat's knife and waits outside the school for him. Instead, he sees Ming and berates her for her promiscuity, saying that he is her only hope. Ming chides Si'r for being selfish and trying to change her; like the world, she cannot be changed. He stabs her to death and breaks down. Si'r is sentenced to death but the media frenzy around the case provokes the sentence to be changed to 15 years imprisonment. In Si'r's now-barren house, his mother unexpectedly finds Si'r's school uniform. As she sobs, the radio broadcasts a list of distinguished students. ==Cast== *Chang Chen as Xiao Si'r (Chang Chen, Xiao Si'r being a nickname that means "Little Four", or the fourth of five children) *Chang Kuo-chu as Xiao Si'r's father *Elaine Jin as Xiao Si'r's mother *Lisa Yang as Ming *Wong Chi-zan as Cat (Wang Mao) *Lawrence Ko as Airplane *Tan Chih-kang as Ma *Lin Hong-ming as Honey *Hung-Yu Chen as Sly *Wang Chuan as Xiao Si'r's eldest sister *Chang Han as Lao Er (elder brother) *Chiang Hsiu-chiung as Xiao Si'r's middle sister *Lai Fan-yun as Xiao Si'r's youngest sister ==Production== Set in early 1960s, in Taipei, the film is based on a real incident that the director remembers from his school days when he was 13.GULING JIE SHAONIAN SHA REN SHIJIAN Review (in English) by Nick James The original Chinese title, , translates literally as "The Homicide Incident of the Youth on Guling Street", referring to the 14-year-old son of a civil servant who murders his girlfriend, who was also involved with a teenaged gang leader, for unclear reasons. The gang leader and girlfriend are involved in the conflict between gangs of children of formerly- mainland families and those of Taiwanese families. The film places the murder incident in the context of the political environment in Taiwan at that time. The film's political background is introduced in intertitles thus: Chang Kuo- chu, and his son Chang Chen (in his debut) are both cast in this film playing father and son. Yang used Goodfellas as the model of a gangster movie. ==Critical reception== The film received much critical acclaim and was awarded several wins in Golden Horse Film Festival, Asia Pacific Film Festival, Kinema Junpo Awards and Tokyo International Film Festival. Three different versions of the film were edited: the original 237-minute version, a three-hour version and a shorter 127-minute version. A Brighter Summer Day is ranked as the 121st most acclaimed film ever and the most acclaimed from 1991 on the review- compiling list They Shoot Pictures, Don't They?. On Rotten Tomatoes, the films holds a perfect rating of 100% based on 20 reviews, with an average score of 9.40/10. The site's critics' consensus reads: "A fantastic cinematic and artistic achievement, Edward Yang's A Brighter Summer Day depicts youth, ideals, violence and politics in a melancholic, tender light, culminating in a complex portrait of Taiwanese identity." A.O. Scott wrote in his 2011 review for The New York Times, "In every aspect of technique —from the smoky colors and the bustling, off-center compositions to the architecture of the story and the emotional precision of the performances — this film is a work of absolute mastery." David Bordwell considers it his favorite Yang film and voted it as one of the 10 best films of the 1990s. He argues that in A Brighter Summer Day, Yang combined some of the cinematographic and staging tendencies that were revealed to him by his contemporary Hou Hsiao-hsien's A City of Sadness and other contemporary films. He also remarks that the "breadth of action is extraordinary, and a sense of the contradictory pulls of daily life emerges steadily... the result is a dispassionate look at teenaged passions, a deromanticized treatment of young people growing up in a repressive milieu." Jonathan Rosenbaum named it one of his 100 favorite films of all-time in 2004 and arguably the greatest Taiwanese film ever, likewise voted it one of the 10 best films of the 1990s, and extolled its "novelistic richness of character, setting, and milieu," use of objects, significance in the Taiwanese New Wave, and likened it to Rebel Without a Cause in their "nocturnal lyricism and cosmic despair." In Film Comments best films of the 1990s poll, A Brighter Summer Day was considered one of the 10 best or 10 most underrated films of the 1990s by 7 critics, academics, and programmers, including Barbara Scharres, former programmer at the Chicago Film Center, who named it the film of the 1990s, calling it a "film that transforms narrative through its deeply personal sense of observation, and grips the emotions and imagination with its steadfast power." Ari Aster named it one of his favorite films in The Criterion Collection in 2018 and commented that "A Brighter Summer Day is just an amazing gangland epic. I don’t know how you watch it without becoming convinced that you’re watching the greatest movie ever made. It’s like The Godfather in that way." ==Themes== According to film critic Godfrey Cheshire, the film has "two faces, just as it has two titles" due to the sudden change of plots the film experiences halfway through its running time. A Brighter Summer Day shifts from a fraught, violent story about teenage gangs to a more introspective and family-oriented movie where the main character passively witnesses how his father is accused of espionage, his brother is in huge debt and his mother suffers in silence. Cheshire explains this transition of "faces": The film's story reflects divisions of nationality, culture, and age in Taiwan a decade after the island was occupied by the Nationalist Chinese government following the end of mainland China's civil war and the establishment of the Communist People's Republic of China. The young characters in the film are affected by the social dislocations caused by their families' exile, changes in traditional social values, the turmoil of young love and friendships, and the lack of a clear direction to a meaningful future. Gradually developing youth gangs, coming under the sponsorship of adult criminals, provide some degree of social acceptance. The adults in their lives, such as Si'r's father, are constricted by their own social status and jobs, the need for money, and unrewarding employment. Further context is seen in the ethnic and class tensions between Chinese, native Taiwanese, and Japanese residents of the island, as well as the cultural influence of the West, especially the United States. ==Restoration and home media== In 2009, the World Cinema Foundation issued a restoration of A Brighter Summer Day, using the original 35mm camera and sound negatives provided by the Edward Yang Estate. On December 17, 2015, The Criterion Collection announced the official North American DVD and Blu-ray release of a new 4K digital restoration of the film in its original running time. This release marks the first time A Brighter Summer Day is released on home video in the United States, after more than two decades of obscurity due to difficulty in finding an official copy of the film. The release includes a new English subtitle translation, an audio commentary featuring critic Tony Rayns, an interview with actor Chang Chen; Our Time, Our Story, a 117-minute documentary from 2002 about the New Taiwan Cinema movement, featuring interviews with Yang and film-makers Hou Hsiao- hsien and Tsai Ming-liang, among others; a videotaped performance of director Edward Yang's 1992 play Likely Consequence; an essay by critic Godfrey Cheshire, and a 1991 director's statement by Yang. ==See also== *List of submissions to the 64th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film *List of Taiwanese submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film *List of films with a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator website ==References== ==External links== * * * * *A Brighter Summer Day at Turner Classic Movies *A Brighter Summer Day: Coming of Age in Taipei an essay by Godfrey Cheshire at the Criterion Collection Category:1991 films Category:1991 drama films Category:Central Motion Picture Corporation films Category:Drama films based on actual events Category:Films directed by Edward Yang Category:Films set in 1960 Category:Films set in 1961 Category:1990s Mandarin-language films Category:1990s political drama films Category:Shanghainese-language films Category:Taiwanese drama films Category:Taiwanese-language films Category:Films about adolescence Category:Films about puberty Category:Teen crime films Category:1990s coming- of-age drama films

69089425	A Brightness Long Ago	A Brightness Long Ago is a historical fantasy novel by Canadian writer Guy Gavriel Kay published in 2019 by Viking Press. It is inspired from the events of 15th-century Italy leading to the Italian Wars, and particularly the feud between Federico da Montefeltro and Sigismondo Pandolfo Malatesta. It is a pseudo-prequel set in the fantasy world of Batiara decades before the events of the 2016 novel Children of Earth and Sky, but readable as a stand-alone novel. Batiara is Kay's analogue to early Renaissance Italy. The dust jacket cover art of the Canadian and US editions depicted birds and was created by Adrian Hillman. Embedded in the dust jacket were specks of gold foil whose sparkling reflection of light made it "stand out" on bookstore shelves. ==Plot== The story is set about 1,000 years after the events of The Sarantine Mosaic duology, 25 years after the demise of Sarantium. It begins as a narrative recollection by Guidanio Cerra, an aging councillor nicknamed Danio who in his youth was admitted to a prestigious school despite being a tailor's son. This leads him to meet the chief steward of nobleman Count Uberto, and later a woman named Adria Ripoli. The latter is daughter of a duke, and plans to assassinate The Beast. From Danio's recollection the plot shifts attention to a healer named Jelena, and subsequently to a political conflict between Folco Cino d’Acorsi, who is the uncle to Adria, and Teobaldo Monticola di Remigio. Danio's narrative describes the military and personal clashes between Cino and Monticola. Adria and Cino conceive a plan for her to reside in a farmhouse near the city, which eventually brings her to the attention of Uberto, known as "The Beast" for his sexual and murderous proclivities. Danio, now employed in the palace of Uberto, may endanger himself or Adria when she is summoned by Uberto to the palace. ==Reception== In a review for The Globe and Mail, Andray Domise states that A Brightness Long Ago is a "return to the narrative form" Kay demonstrated in The Lions of Al-Rassan, with characters that are better developed as a result of greater focus on the story revolving around the principal characters. Kay also devotes more of the story to describing the lives of the female characters, instead of focusing on an exceptional female lead as he had in Children of Earth and Sky, in which the secondary women characters were "accessories and playthings". Gary K. Wolfe, in a review for Locus, states that the two principal female characters in the novel "are among [the] most impressive" Kay has written. Bill Capossere describes Kay's writing as having "supreme elegance and grace", and Tadiana Jones states that Kay has "lyrical and profoundly thoughtful storytelling". Niall Alexander, in his review for Tor.com, states that the fringe characters were created with a "depth and tenderness and intelligence" by which the insignificant are given significance. A review by Kirkus Reviews stated that the book exhibits Kay's "usual elements", including numerous characters, extensive worldbuilding based on historical research, significant events altering the world, and writing "that sometimes gets carried away with itself". It was one of six finalists for the 2020 Aurora Award for Best Novel. ==References== ==External links== *A Brightness Long Ago at Bright Weavings * Category:2019 Canadian novels Category:2019 fantasy novels Category:Novels by Guy Gavriel Kay Category:Viking Press books

17197328	A Brisk Young Sailor Courted Me	"A Brisk Young Sailor (Courted Me)" (variously known as "Bold Young Farmer", "The Alehouse", "Died For Love" and "I Wish My Baby Was Born" amongst other titles) is a traditional folk ballad (Roud # 60, Laws P25), which has been collected from all over Britain, Ireland and North America. The song originates in England in the early 1600s.English Folk Songs from the Southern Appalachians, Volume 1 Cecil J. Sharp Loomis House Press, Jun 1, 2012 , 9781935243175 ==Synopsis== A young sailor courts a young girl and wins her heart. But now he visits an alehouse in another town and entertains another. He is false and this other girl has more gold than she but that will waste along with her beauty. But our heroine still loves him dearly and besides she's carrying his child. Oh, what a foolish girl she was to have given her heart to a sailor. In some versions, she dies of a broken heart and in others, he is not a sailor but a farmer or other unspecified young man. ==Commentary== The Traditional Ballad Index states that one 1891 source claims the song was written by an F. J. Adams but the wide variety of different versions collected from a wide area not long after this would tend to contradict that theory. ==Similar songs== There are several other traditional ballads which can easily be confused with "A Brisk Young Sailor". For example, "John Riley" (Roud #264/Laws N42) sometimes also goes by the same title but tells of a sailor returning to his lover after seven years to heal a broken tryst. Roud # 843 (Laws M22), "Jolly Young Sailor Boy" also tells the story of a girl falling for a sailor but in this case her father sends him away to sea, which itself has a similar plot to "Beam of Oak" (Roud 18830). ==Lyrics== ==Recordings== *Shirley Collins recorded "Died for Love" on False True Lovers (1959) *Martin Carthy recorded "Died for Love" on Prince Heathen (with Dave Swarbrick) (1969) *Tim Eriksen, Riley Baugus and Tim O'Brien performed a version called "I Wish My Baby Was Born" for the soundtrack to the film Cold Mountain (2003) * The Be Good Tanyas included "I Wish My Baby Was Born" on the album Chinatown (2003) * Kate Rusby recorded a version called "I Wish" on the album "Celtic Compass" (2003) *Rachel Unthank and the Winterset recorded I Wish, I Wish on The Bairns (2007) * Eva Cassidy posthumously released A Bold Young Farmer on Somewhere (2008) ==References== ==External links== *A broadside of the ballad *The ballad with MIDI tune *Lyrics and musical score for piano and singer Category:Traditional ballads Category:Songs about sailors Category:English folk songs Category:Year of song unknown

It was then released in the United Kingdom cinemas on September 17, 2021. == Critical reception == On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 89% based on 19 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. In her review for The Guardian Cath Clarke praised the direction and performances but felt that the social commentary was overpowering. Clarke concluded: "Its a film with some strong moments and impressive performances, especially from Orebiyi. But in the end it feels like social commentary overtakes the drama." Leslie Byron Pitt, a critic from the magazine Little White Lies writes in her review that the social gap between Benji and Leah is portrayed in a brutally honest way. With Leah you can never be sure that she is aware of her status or her privileges. On the other hand, the film makes it very clear from the start that Benji is not the stereotypical “product of his surroundings” that Leah really wants to portray. Alex Davidson for Sight & Sound praised the lead performances, particularly from Orebiyi, and the anti- privilege theme but criticised some simplicity in the story. He considered "A Brixton Tale has a simplicity that sometimes verges on the simplistic but the strong lead performances, some effective set pieces and its unassailable arguments against privilege make this a tale worth telling." Wendy Ide for Screen Daily praised Orebiyi's performance while also criticising the use of Lea as a narrative device in some aspects of the story. Ide stated " ... there is a skittish unpredictable energy to the storytelling and a well realised sense of place ... === Festivals === Oldenburg International Film Festival 2021 * Nominated for Best Film for the Audience Award / German Independence Award (Darragh Carey and Bertrand Desrochers) SCHLINGEL International Film Festival 2021 * Audience award [Winner] Slamdance Film Festival 2021 * Grand Jury Prize [Nominee] Best Narrative Feature == References == == External links == * * Category:2021 romantic drama films Category:British romantic drama films Category:2021 films Category:2020s British films

13094841	A Broadway Musical	A Broadway Musical is a musical with a book by William F. Brown, lyrics by Lee Adams, and music by Charles Strouse. The Broadway production closed after 14 previews and only one performance on December 21, 1978. The plot about a sleazy white theatre producer's attempt to adapt an African-American writer's serious play as a commercial stage musical was inspired by Adams and Strouse's real-life experiences with their 1964 Broadway production of Golden Boy. The star of the musical-within-the-musical (Sneakers, about a basketball star) closely resembles Golden Boy star Sammy Davis, Jr. When the star opts to leave the show, the playwright – who from the start had resisted turning his work into a musical – steps in and takes on the lead role in order to save the production. ==Background and production== The creators hoped that the backstage story about the making of a musical would cash in on the success of A Chorus Line as well as the popularity of the black-themed musical, including Brown's own The Wiz, which was still running at the time. But Brown's much- criticized book is a clichéd spoof of show business lawyers, idealistic young playwrights, glitzy Las Vegas performers, blue-haired matinée ladies, and the black-themed musical itself. The Wiz proved to be Brown's only success.Gilvey, John Anthony. Before the Parade Passes by: Gower Champion and the Glorious American Musical. (2005) St. Martin's Press Following a dismal October–November tryout with Helen Gallagher and Julius LaRosa at the theatre in the Riverside Church in Morningside Heights, the producers fired most of the cast and creative personnel, including director/choreographer George Faison.Mandelbaum, p. 138 Gower Champion was called in to rescue the Broadway- bound production with only a month to go, but he feared that the show's defects were too serious to remedy and insisted on receiving a "Production supervised by" credit only. After 14 previews, the Broadway production opened and closed the same night at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on December 21, 1978.

They envisioned it as "funny, ironic ... and filled with life's imbalances."Strouse, Charles. "A Broadway Musical", Put on a Happy Face: A Broadway Memoir, Union Square Press, 2008, , p. 249 Mel Gussow, in his review for The New York Times, wrote that the idea was to write a spoof of Broadway intrigue and duplicity; "cynicism is rampant." There are jokes about blacks on Broadway, Jewish theater party women and lawyers with "steel clauses." The lyrics are not funny. Finally, Gussow wrote: "The cast performs with eagerness, even as the show sinks."Gussow, Mel. "Stage: Musical About a Musical: Art Mimics Life", The New York Times, December 22, 1978, p. C3 Julius Novick of The Village Voice called it "the best Broadway musical since Platinum," a disaster that had opened the month before. Critic and theatre historian Ken Mandelbaum has described the show as "a genuine turkey... hopeless... [a] well-meaning but fatally underpowered evening. The Charles Strouse-Lee Adams score had its moments."Mandelbaum, Ken. "Looking BacK: '78-'79", Broadway.com, June 27, 2005, accessed January 31, 2019 Mandelbaum noted that "the characters were all clichés. ... A shallow treatment of a theme with potential ... was capped with an absurd ending". ==References== *Not Since Carrie: Forty Years of Broadway Musical Flops by Ken Mandelbaum, published by St. Martin's Press (1991), pp. 136–38 () ==Notes== ==External links== *Internet Broadway Database *Recollections about the show from co- producer Garth Drabinsky *A Broadway Musical Off-Broadway at Lortel Archives * Charles Strouse Official site Category:1978 musicals Category:Broadway musicals Category:Musicals inspired by real-life events Category:Musicals by Charles Strouse

18150145	A Broadway Scandal	A Broadway Scandal is a 1918 American silent romantic drama film directed by Joe De Grasse that features Carmel Myers, Lon Chaney and Edwin August. The screenplay was written by Harvey Gates. This would be Lon Chaney's last film for director Joe De Grasse, ending a multiyear collaboration between the two men.Blake, Michael F. (1998). "The Films of Lon Chaney". Vestal Press Inc. p. 85. . The film's tagline was "Engagement Extraordinary! An Amazing Romance of a French Girl in New York". It is today considered to be a lost film. A still exists showing Lon Chaney as Kink Colby, together with the other main players in the shot. Like many American films of the time, A Broadway Scandal was subject to restrictions and cuts by city and state film censorship boards. For example, the Chicago Board of Censors cut, in Reel 2, the shooting of a motorcycle policeman. ==Plot== Nenette Bisson (Myers), an adventurous French girl, is shot in the shoulder by the police while joyriding in a stolen car with a lowlife punk named "Kink" Colby (Lon Chaney). Nenette is taken to the Kendall Hospital, where she becomes infatuated with her young physician, David Kendall (August). Kendall, believing all French women to be frivolous, toys with Nenette's affections but will not look upon her as a serious candidate for marriage. War breaks out and Dr. Kendall goes off to Europe to offer medical aid to the suffering. Nenette's father Armande runs a small cafe in New York City where Nenette sings for the patrons. Enraged, he throws her out when he learns of her involvement with Kink Colby. Over the next two years, Nenette goes on to become a Broadway star, but her attempts to win her father's forgiveness are fruitless. One night, however, she shows up at the cafe unexpectedly and tries in vain to get her father to forgive her. Dr. Kendall, home from the war after two years, has come to value the courage of French women while he was stationed in Europe. He seeks out Nenette at the cafe and proposes marriage to her. He later helps her to win back her father's love and approval. ==Cast== * Carmel Myers as Nenette Bisson * Edwin August as Dr. David Kendall * Lon Chaney as "Kink" Colby * Andrew Robson as Armande Bisson (Nenette's father) * W.

1211024	A Broken Frame	A Broken Frame is the second studio album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released on 27 September 1982 by Mute Records. The album was written entirely by Martin Gore and was recorded as a trio after the departure of Vince Clarke, who had left and formed Yazoo with singer Alison Moyet. Alan Wilder was part of a second band tour in the United Kingdom prior to the release of A Broken Frame, but had not officially joined yet and does not appear on the album. The album was proceeded by the singles 'See You', released on 29 January 1982, 'The Meaning of Love', released on 26 April 1982 and 'Leave in Silence', released on 16 August 1982. ==Critical reception and legacy== Smash Hits wrote that A Broken Frame, in contrast to the group's early post-Clarke singles showed "a lack of purpose", "makes a virtue of their tinkly-bonk whimsy". In contrast, Melody Maker wrote that, although "ambitious and bold", "A Broken Frame – as its name suggests – marks the end of a beautiful dream", a comment on the departure of main songwriter Clarke. Reviewer Steve Sutherland considered the songs "daft aspirations to art", the album's musical and thematic "larcenies" sounding like "puerile infatuations papering over anonymity". At the same time, Sutherland acknowledged that the group's increasing complexity "sounds less the result of exterior persuasion than an understandable, natural development", although he finally concluded that Depeche Mode remain (in contrast to Clarke's new group Yazoo) "essentially vacuous". The comments of Noise! magazine's "DH" (most likely Noise! contributor Dave Henderson) showed greater prescience. "DH" said that the album "falls together well and shows we can expect a lot more from the clean cut quartet", adding "[a]t times it reaches high points far exceeding their first album." In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Ned Raggett described A Broken Frame as "a notably more ambitious effort than the pure pop/disco of the band's debut", with much of the album "forsaking earlier sprightliness... for more melancholy reflections about love gone wrong". He added: "More complex arrangements and juxtaposed sounds, such as the sparkle of breaking glass in 'Leave in Silence', help give this underrated album even more of an intriguing, unexpected edge." In 1990, while promoting their album Violator, songwriter Martin Gore lamented parts of the album, saying, "I regret all that sickly boy-next-door stuff of the early days... musically A Broken Frame was a mish-mash". The band's distaste for the promotion led to their debut music video compilation album Some Great Videos to omit all of the videos that were made in order to promote the album. ==Cover image== Despite being a photograph, the cover artwork is intended to resemble a painting. It depicts a woman cutting grain in an East Anglian field, near Duxford in Cambridgeshire. It was taken by Brian Griffin (who had previously taken the cover photograph for Speak & Spell and press photos for the band) using a mixture of natural and artificial lighting. Griffin cited as inspirations the socialist realism of Soviet Russia, especially the work of Kazimir Malevich, and German Romanticism. Griffin has displayed on his website a gallery of alternative images from the same shoot. Later releases of the album on vinyl (2007) and compact disc (2009) feature slightly different takes of the shot. It was also featured on the cover of Lifes 1990 edition of "World's Best Photographs 1980–1990". ==Tour== The tour began in October 1982 in Chippenham, England. The jaunt eventually reached 12 countries, which included the group's first shows in Asia, before wrapping up with a one-off festival appearance in Schüttorf, West Germany, in May 1983. A tour in support of the act's subsequent studio release, Construction Time Again, followed in September. Selected tracks from the 25 October 1982 show at the Hammersmith Odeon in London have been published on the "Get the Balance Right!", "Everything Counts" and "Love, in Itself" limited-edition 12-inch singles. ==Track listing== * Some original US CD copies of the album tacked the intro of "The Sun & the Rainfall" onto the end of "Shouldn't Have Done That", making the duration of "The Sun & the Rainfall" 4:54. * Dave Gahan sings lead vocals on all songs except "Shouldn't Have Done That" which is a duet with Gore. "Nothing to Fear" and "Further Excerpts From: My Secret Garden" are instrumental. ===2006 Collectors Edition (CD + DVD)=== * Disc one is a hybrid SACD/CD with a multi-channel SACD layer. The track listing is identical to the 1982 UK release, except "Satellite" which is 4:43 long and contains a slight edit, or error, at the beginning of the track. * Disc two is a DVD which includes A Broken Frame in DTS 5.1, Dolby Digital 5.1 and PCM Stereo plus bonus material.

Release Magazine wrote that this version was not "anything essential" but well done. The Electricity Club found influences of And One in the cover of "The Sun & the Rainfall" and concluded that Marsheaux had "used unconventional sounds and vocals to make this record their own". Reviews from Germany noted that Marsheaux had elaborated on the assets and downsides of the original release. According to Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, the kitschy sides of the early Depeche Mode album were deliberately uncovered in tracks like "The Meaning of Love", while the Sonic Seducer lauded Marsheaux's darker and slower interpretation of this song. ==References== ==External links== * * Album information from the official Depeche Mode website * Official remaster info Category:1982 albums Category:Albums produced by Daniel Miller (music producer) Category:Depeche Mode albums Category:Mute Records albums

22362799	A Broken Leghorn	A Broken Leghorn is a 1959 Warner Bros. Looney Tunes cartoon short directed by Robert McKimson. The cartoon was released on September 26, 1959, and features Foghorn Leghorn and Miss Prissy. The voices are performed by Mel Blanc. ==Plot== Foghorn Leghorn takes pity on Miss Prissy, whom the other hens are ridiculing because of her inability to lay an egg. To give her confidence, Foghorn slips one of the other hen's eggs under Miss Prissy as she is sitting on her nest. This garners surprise and some admiration as the other hens realize the egg has hatched a rooster chick. Foghorn overhears this fact and is immediately not pleased; there is, he believes, no need for the presence of another rooster "around here". Initially storming into the hen house to make his views known he is taken aback to see the hens standing - arms folded - as a united front. Foghorn decides to "play it cagey" instead and feigns interest in "the cute little tyke". The chick already has designs on Foghorn's job; the rooster realizes that "this kid's gotta go". He approaches Miss Prissy and gains her permission to "train" her son in "the ancient art of roostering". The rooster chick, however, has figured out Foghorn's plans for him. Foghorn proceeds with attempts to get rid of his small rival, including: coaxing him to be a chicken crossing the road, hopefully into oncoming traffic; trying to get him to pull a cob of corn hard enough to activate the trigger of a rifle Foghorn tied it to. However, each of these attempts ends with Foghorn getting the worst of things. Finally, Foghorn stomps towards the farm owner's house, intending to "have it out with the boss" and with the intended ultimatum, "One of us has gotta go!" Upon entering, he is being driven away just as quickly as he entered. He is placed in a cage on the back of a truck, marked "Acme Poultry Co." Foghorn, somewhat bewildered by the unexpected turn of events, says "Well, I guess when you gotta go, you gotta go." ==See also== * List of American films of 1959 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1959 films Category:1959 short films Category:1959 comedy films Category:1959 animated films Category:1950s American animated films Category:1950s animated short films Category:1950s English-language films Category:1950s Warner Bros. animated short films Category:American animated short films Category:Looney Tunes shorts Category:Foghorn Leghorn films Category:Films set on farms Category:Films set in 1959 Category:Films directed by Robert McKimson Category:Films scored by Milt Franklyn Category:Warner Bros.

1342613	A Bronx Morning	thumb|thumbtime=16|A Bronx Morning A Bronx Morning is a 1931 American Pre-Code avant-garde film by American filmmaker Jay Leyda (1910–1988). Described as "city symphony", the eleven-minute European style film recorded a Bronx street in New York City before it is crowded with traffic. Largely unnoticed in the United States, on the strength of this film Leyda was invited to study with Soviet filmmaker Sergei Eisenstein, the only American to do so. In 2004, A Bronx Morning was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". The film was funded with the proceeds of a sale of a wooden figurine of Henry Ward Beecher, which Leyda had originally found in a junk shop, to a representative of Abby Aldrich Rockefeller.Ian Christie and Richard Taylor, Eisenstein Rediscovered, Routledge, 1993, p43. ==References== ==External links== *A Bronx Morning essay by Scott Simmon on the National Film Registry site. *A Bronx Morning essay by Daniel Eagan in America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, A&C; Black, 2010 , pages 189-190 * Category:1931 films Category:1930s avant-garde and experimental films Category:1931 short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American avant-garde and experimental films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Films directed by Jay Leyda Category:Films set in the Bronx Category:Films shot in New York City Category:United States National Film Registry films Category:1930s American films
591309	A Bronx Tale	A Bronx Tale is a 1993 American coming-of-age crime drama film directed by and starring Robert De Niro in his directorial debut and produced by Jane Rosenthal, adapted from Chazz Palminteri's 1989 play of the same name. It tells the coming of age story of an Italian-American boy, Calogero, who, after encountering a local Mafia boss, is torn between the temptations of organized crime and the values of his honest, hardworking father, as well as racial tensions in his community. The Broadway production was converted to film with limited changes, and starred Palminteri and De Niro. De Niro, who first viewed the play in Los Angeles in 1990, acquired the rights from Palminteri, intent on making the play his directorial debut. The duo then worked heavily together on the screenplay, with Palminteri aiming to retain many of the aspects of the original script, as it was based largely on his own childhood. Production began in 1991, and was funded in collaboration with De Niro's TriBeCa Productions and Savoy Pictures, as the first film released by each studio. A Bronx Tale premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 1993, and released in the United States on September 29, 1993. The film achieved limited commercial success, grossing over $17 million domestically. However, it fared much better with critics, who praised the performances of the leads, and launched Palminteri's acting career, while also helping De Niro gain acceptance as a director. ==Plot== In 1960, nine-year-old Calogero lives in Belmont, a working-class Italian-American neighborhood in The Bronx with his father, Lorenzo, an MTA bus driver, and his mother, Rosina. Calogero becomes enamored with the Mafia presence in his neighborhood led by local boss Sonny. One day, Calogero witnesses Sonny shoot and kill a man assaulting his friend. Calogero keeps quiet when questioned by NYPD Detectives. Sonny's men offer Lorenzo a better paying job but, preferring a law-abiding life, he politely declines. Sonny befriends Calogero and gives him the nickname "C". Calogero earns tips working in Sonny's bar and throwing dice and is admonished by Lorenzo when he discovers the cash. Lorenzo returns the money to Sonny and warns him to keep away from Calogero. Eight years later, a 17-year old Calogero has been visiting Sonny regularly without his father's knowledge. Calogero is part of a gang of local Italian-American boys, which concerns Sonny. Calogero meets an African-American girl, Jane, and they develop a tentative friendship. Despite the high level of racial tension between Italian-Americans and African-Americans in the area, Calogero arranges a date with Jane. He asks for advice from Sonny, who decides to lend Calogero his car. Later, Calogero's friends beat up a group of African-American cyclists riding through their neighborhood. One of the cyclists turns out to be Jane's brother, who accuses Calogero of beating him up when he and Jane meet for their date. Calogero loses his temper over the accusation, and calls him a nigger, which he instantly regrets. Jane leaves with her brother. At home, Lorenzo confronts Calogero after seeing him driving Sonny's car. They argue and Calogero storms out. He runs into his friends, who tell him that some African-Americans egged their social club in retaliation to the earlier beating. Shortly thereafter, Sonny and his crew confront Calogero after finding a bomb on Sonny's car. Calogero tearfully pleads his unwavering dedication to Sonny, who recognizes Calogero's innocence and allows him to leave. Calogero meets up with friends, who plan revenge on the African- Americans using Molotov cocktails. They force Calogero to participate, but Sonny stops their car and orders Calogero out. Calogero catches up with Jane, who tells him that her brother admitted that Calogero was not his assailant. Jane and Calogero make amends, but he suddenly remembers his friends' plans to attack Jane's neighborhood, and the two rush to stop them. During the attack, an African-American shopkeeper throws an unbroken Molotov cocktail back at the boys' car which enters through the window and ignites the Molotov cocktails still in the vehicle, resulting in an explosion that kills everyone inside. When Calogero and Jane arrive, they find the car engulfed in flames and the boys' dead bodies burned. Calogero leaves and rushes into Sonny's bar to thank him for saving his life, but an assassin shoots Sonny in the back of the head before Calogero can warn him. Calogero later learns that the killer was the son of the man he witnessed Sonny kill when he was nine. At Sonny's funeral, countless people come to pay their respects. When everyone but Calogero disperses, a lone man, Carmine, visits the funeral, claiming that Sonny once saved his life as well. Calogero does not recognize Carmine until he sees a scar on his forehead and realizes he was the man whom Sonny defended by shooting the other man eight years ago. Carmine tells Calogero that he is filling in for Sonny in the neighborhood for the time being and promises Calogero help should he ever need it. Carmine leaves just as Lorenzo unexpectedly arrives to pay his respects to Sonny. Lorenzo thanks him for saving his son's life and admits that he never hated him, but that he resented him for making Calogero grow up so quickly. Calogero bids Sonny goodbye and walks home with Lorenzo while narrating the lessons he learned from his two mentors. ==Cast== * Robert De Niro as Lorenzo * Chazz Palminteri as "Sonny" * Lillo Brancato, Jr. as Calogero (age 17) ** Francis Capra as Calogero (age 9) * Taral Hicks as Jane * Kathrine Narducci as Rosina * Clem Caserta as Jimmy "Whispers" * Frank Pietrangolare as Danny "K.O." * Joe Pesci as Carmine * Alfred Sauchelli Jr. as Bobby "Bars" * Robert D'Andrea as Tony "Toupee" * Eddie Montanaro as Eddie "Mush" * Fred Fischer as Joe "Jo Jo The Whale" * Dave Salerno as Frankie "Coffeecake" * Joe D'Onofrio as "Slick" (Age 17) * Louis Vanaria as Mario "Crazy Mario" * Domenick Lombardozzi as Nicky "Zero" ==Production== The film is based on Chazz Palminteri's original play of the same name, which was performed as a one-man show, being largely based on his own childhood, specifically the shooting Calogero witnesses as a child, as well as the occupation and name of his father. In 1990, at a performance of A Bronx Tale, Robert De Niro met with Palminteri in his dressing room after having seen the show. De Niro told Palminteri, "This is one of the greatest one-man shows I've ever seen, if not the greatest ... This is a movie, this is an incredible movie." After acquiring the rights to create the film, with De Niro claiming the deal was made solely with a gentlemen's agreement with Palminteri, the duo began crafting the screenplay. Prior to partnering with De Niro, Palminteri rejected several offers for the film's rights, including some as high as $1 million, due to not being granted the roles of primary screenwriter and Sonny, the gangster Calogero meets. De Niro met Palminteri's requirements on the condition that he be allowed to direct the film and play Lorenzo, Calogero's father, which Palminteri accepted. ==Release== ===Theatrical=== The film premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 1993. It was then released in the United States on September 29, 1993. === Home media === Sometime after the film's theatrical run, HBO released the movie on VHS, CD and in 1998 on DVD. The DVD is out of print, but in January 2010, Focus Features released a DVD copy of the film exclusive to online retailer Amazon. == Reception == ===Box office=== A Bronx Tale opened in 1,077 theaters, with an opening weekend gross of $3.7 million. It went on to make $17.3 million domestically. ===Critical response=== On Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 97% based on 33 reviews, with an average rating of 7.5/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "A Bronx Tale sets itself apart from other coming-of-age dramas thanks to a solid script, a terrific cast, and director Robert De Niro's sensitive work behind the camera." Metacritic gave it a weighted average score of 80 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, calling it "very funny [and] very touching. It is filled with life and colorful characters and great lines of dialogue, and De Niro, in his debut as a director, finds the right notes as he moves from laughter to anger to tears [while] retaining its values." In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Gangster Films list. == Awards and nominations == Year Award Category Nominee Result 1994 Artios Award Best Casting for Feature Film Ellen Chenoweth 1994 Young Artist Award Best Youth Actor Co-Starring in a Motion Picture Drama Francis Capra 1996 Jordi Award Best Foreign Actor Chazz Palminteri Also for Bullets Over Broadway and The Usual Suspects == References == == External links == * * * * * Category:1993 crime drama films Category:1993 films Category:American crime drama films Category:American coming-of-age drama films Category:Films about the American Mafia Category:American gangster films Category:Films about race and ethnicity Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by Robert De Niro Category:Films set in the Bronx Category:Films set in 1960 Category:Films set in 1968 Category:Films about interracial romance Category:Films about racism Category:Savoy Pictures films Category:Belmont, Bronx Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films shot in New Jersey Category:1993 directorial debut films Category:1990s coming-of-age drama films Category:Films about father–son relationships Category:Films produced by Jon Kilik Category:Films about Italian-American culture Category:1990s English- language films Category:1990s American films

13556700	A Bronx Tale (play)	A Bronx Tale is an autobiographical one-man show written and performed by Chazz Palminteri. It tells the coming-of-age story of Calogero Anello, a young New Yorker torn between the temptations of organized crime and the values of his hardworking father. It originally premiered in Los Angeles in 1989, before moving Off-Broadway. A film version involving Palminteri and Robert DeNiro was released in 1993.

Calogero's father is a bus driver who tries to instill working-class family values in his son. As Calogero gets older, the aura and mystique of the Mafia, and the charms of Sonny, the local mob boss who befriends Calogero (and ends up becoming a father figure to him), become difficult to resist. As Calogero comes of age, he must struggle with the choice of following his beloved father's values or submitting to the temptations of the life of organized crime. ==Background and productions== Palminteri states that he began writing the play after being fired from a club when, as a doorman, he refused entry to super agent Swifty Lazar."Broadway Names with Julie James," On Broadway, SiriusXM, 11 Oct 2012.Winn, Steven.

41970016	A Brony Tale	A Brony Tale (originally titled Brony) is a 2014 Canadian-American documentary film directed by Brent Hodge. The film explores the brony phenomenon, the adult fan base of the children's animated show My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic that arose shortly after its premiere in 2010. The film is structured around the journey of Ashleigh Ball, one of the principal voice actresses for the show, including her initial reactions to learning of this older fanbase, and her travel as a Guest of Honor to one of the first fan conventions BronyCon held in New York City in 2012. Hodge, a close friend of and previous collaborator with Ball, was curious as she was as to this phenomenon and opted to film her travel and appearance at the convention for the documentary. Hodge's film gained interest of film producer and publisher Morgan Spurlock who helped to promote wider distribution of the documentary. Initially slated to be shown for Vancouver-area film festivals, the film was highlighted at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, and received critical praise. The film received a wider theater release starting in July 2014, and is currently available on DVD, Blu-ray, Digital Download and On Demand. The film's Blu-ray was sold for the first time at the 2014 New York Comic Con. The film also screened in 290 theaters across Mexico in late 2014. ==Synopsis== Ashleigh Ball, one of the lead voice actresses in Hasbro's My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic, begins to notice that she is receiving fan mail for her work on the show, but is perplexed over the fact that most of it is coming from teenagers and adults. These fans, who call themselves "bronies" and are mostly male, take the show's themes and messages of personal responsibility and friendship to heart. Ball accepts an invitation to attend the Winter 2012 BronyCon, a then-semiannual fan convention held in New York City, as a guest of honor and takes the opportunity to meet the fans. Footage of Ball's interviews and travels is intercut with segments focusing on different fans of the show, including: a burly motorcycle mechanic and former college football player, a United States Army veteran who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, the producer of an Internet radio network, and a husband-and-wife team of psychologists who became interested in the show after learning about it from their son. Andrea Libman and Nicole Oliver, two other members of the voice cast, make brief appearances. The film also includes footage and interviews from the Canterlot Gardens fan convention held during mid-2012 near Cleveland, as well as footage from live performances of Ball's band, Hey Ocean! ==Production== While focusing on Ball's trip to BronyCon, the film also briefly features fellow My Little Pony voice cast members Nicole Oliver and Andrea Libman. Director Brent Hodge said that he funded the film himself, and felt it was easy to film as he personally knew Ashleigh Ball. He decided to film as a "fly on the wall" at the meetups so as to not interfere with the goings on and to see the brony world as it really is. During a panel at BronyCon 2013, Hodge went into detail on the film, and showed a trailer to the audience, and revealed that the idea had come about when Ball was asked to do the convention. In an interview with Everfree News, Hodge went into detail on the film, explaining that it was an outsider view on the brony community that had evolved from simply a documentary on Ball and her voice career. ==Promotion and release== The film was originally planned to be part of the local Vancouver DOXA Documentary Film Festival on May 11, 2014, where it was selected to close out the show. To Hodge's surprise, the film was selected as one of five special documentary screenings for the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival and was named one of the top 10 movies to see at Tribeca by Indiewire. The film premiere screening at Tribeca was sold out within hours, and its screening there has brought more attention to the film, according to Hodge. The film was picked up in April 2014 by an independent film distribution company, Morgan Spurlock Presents, a collaboration between Spurlock's Warrior Poets, Virgil Films, and Abramorama. A Brony Tale is the first film distributed under this label. Along with the Tribeca premiere and prior to the selected theatrical release, the film had film festival screenings in Vancouver, British Columbia, Seattle, Washington, Wellington, New Zealand, Auckland, New Zealand, and has screenings scheduled in Mexico City, Mexico, Monterrey, Mexico and Guadalajara, Mexico via the brony convention FluttyCon 2014 and The Brony Chef. The film was released on July 8, 2014 in at least twenty different theater markets within North America and was released for home media via Video-On-Demand and DVD/Blu-ray and cable. ==Reception== The film has received positive reviews. It currently holds an 80% score with an average rating of 6.7/10 based on reviews from 9 critics on aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes. Christopher Campbell of Movies.com praised Brent Hodge's directing, noting how Hodge "situates the phenomenon inside an identifiable world rather than setting it aside like it's some kind of otherness." Campbell went on to say in his review, "They're compared to the jazz crowd of the 1920s and to the Beatniks and, most assuredly, to the hippies . . . Hodge comes closer to making those of us who can't possibly get it at least start to comprehend what is really going on here and why. If we all joined them in not necessarily watching and playing with and dressing up as My Little Pony but at least in following its message and influence, then the planet would be a much better place." John Lucas of Straight.com said, "Brent Hodge's documentary about fans of My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic suggests that there is no such thing as a typical "brony"; the subjects here include a sensitive Iraq War veteran and a burly motorcycle mechanic...A connecting thread is provided by Vancouver-based voice actor Ashleigh Ball... by the end Ball is touched by the realization that she's an integral part of something much larger than a kiddie show." Marina Antunes of Row Three called the film "the best documentary I've seen on the subject", and went on to applaud the film, saying that the film "has the advantage of a filmmaker who understands storytelling and Hodge does an excellent job not only of capturing the energy and passion of the fans but packaging that up in a documentary that is both entertaining and informative." IGN gave the film a score of 9.1, praising the portrayal of the fandom, interviews, the scientific study of bronies, and subject of gender roles. However, criticism was voiced regarding the lack of staff from the show, and the story about a military brony having no conclusion. ==Awards== The film was screened as an "Official Selection" at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival, the 2014 New Zealand Documentary Edge Festival, the 2014 Seattle International Film Festival, the 2014 DOXA Documentary Festival, the 2014 SouthSide Film Festival and the 2014 Las Vegas Film Festival. The film won "Best Documentary" at the Las Vegas Film Festival and has been nominated for 4 Leo Awards, at the 2015 Leo Awards, in "Best Documentary Feature", "Best Direction in a Documentary Feature", "Best Sound in a Documentary Feature" and "Best Music in a Documentary Feature". The film won the 2015 Leo Award for "Best Sound in a Documentary Feature". ==See also== * Bronies: The Extremely Unexpected Adult Fans of My Little Pony, a 2012 documentary film * Hey Ocean! * My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic ==References== == External links == * * * Category:My Little Pony fandom Category:My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic Category:2014 films Category:2014 documentary films Category:Canadian documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:New Zealand documentary films Category:Documentary films about fandom Category:Canadian independent films Category:Films directed by Brent Hodge Category:American independent films Category:New Zealand independent films Category:2014 independent films Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s American films Category:2010s Canadian films

Southern Africa Political & Economic Monthly, Volume 9. Southern African Political Economy Series (SAPES) Publications Project, 1995, pp. 11–12. == Background == A Brother With Perfect Timing was filmed in 1986 – four years before the release from prison of Nelson Mandela, and while the apartheid regime was still in place. . The documentary includes a live performance by Ibrahim and discussions about two of his compositions, "Anthem for a New Nation" and "Mannenberg". As described by the reviewer for KUVO radio, "Throughout the film Ibrahim plays different roles. At times he is the narrator, telling stories and sharing anecdotes, cultural and musical history lessons, offering metaphors, and even jokes for how he and other musicians developed and grew into being. ... He is seen performing with his septet Ekaya at the Manhattan nightclub Sweet Basil, as well as rehearsing a choral group. Some scenes in South Africa feature actors dramatizing events that Ibrahim recounts." Musicians featured with Ibrahim include Carlos Ward, Ricky Ford, Charles Davis, Essiet Okon Essiet, Don Mumford and Ben Riley. The film was originally broadcast in the BBC Two series Arena on 27 February 1987. ==Reception== The New York Times positively reviewed the film, calling it "a well-rounded view of a musician for whom exile means both pain and inspiration".Pareles, Jon, "Film: Abdullah Ibrahim", The New York Times, 4 September 1987. The film was reviewed in the 2004 book Jazz on Film, in which author Scott Yanow praised the movie's "blend of interviews and music".Yanow, Scott. Jazz on Film. Backbeat Books, 2004, pp. 29–30.

It is based on the 1988 play by Rosenfeld and also his directorial debut. Rosenfeld grew up in the same neighborhood as actor Michael Raynor; Raynor and actor Nick Chinlund were friends as children. ==Plot== Mick (Michael Raynor) and Lex (Nick Chinlund) are a pair of brothers who grew up in Harlem under circumstances that were difficult at best. Their mother Doreen (Cathy Moriarty) was a diabetic with a drinking problem and difficulty in saying no to men. While she wasn't a sex worker, she grew dependent on the little gifts her lovers would bring by, and as kids, Mick and Lex learned to accept this as the way things were. One night, Mick and Lex were taking a walk in the park when they were accosted by a cop who molested the younger Mick. Lex, older and strong as a grown man, attacked the cop, which led to a stay in a reform school. Years later, Mick is himself a policeman; while he's tried to bury the childhood incident in his past, he still shows emotional scars and is sexually dysfunctional. Lex has taken the more dramatic slide, getting in and out of trouble since reform school and maintaining a going-nowhere job driving a bus. He has a combative relationship with Debbie (Rosie Perez), girlfriend and the mother of his child, while also selling drugs for local dealer Lefty Louie (John Leguizamo). His own habit has developed so far that his sales don't compensate for the amount he uses himself.

60528392	A Brother's Love	A Brother's Love () is a 2019 Canadian comedy-drama film written and directed by Monia Chokri. It had its world premiere in the Un Certain Regard section of the 2019 Cannes Film Festival. It was released theatrically in Canada on 7 June 2019 by Les Films Séville. The film stars Anne-Élisabeth Bossé as Sophia, an immature university graduate student who is forced to reassess her life when her brother Karim (Patrick Hivon), with whom she has always had a very close and codependent relationship, falls in love with her gynecologist Éloise (Evelyne Brochu). ==Plot== Sophia earns her PhD for her thesis on Antonio Gramsci, but discovers a lack of teaching positions available in her field and is saddled with student debt. At age 35, she lives rent-free with her brother Karim and leads tours at a local art gallery. Pregnant, Sophia seeks an abortion and she and Karim meet Eloïse, a doctor. Eloïse recognizes Karim as a man she met and slept with when she first moved to Montreal several years ago. Although Karim does not remember Eloïse, they agree to see each other again. After the abortion, Sophia tells Karim he should date a woman like Eloïse, but is turned off when he replies he will see Eloïse herself. Sophia loses her job at the gallery and decides to write a novel. She returns to Karim's apartment and speaks loudly about how she imagined Karim's date with Eloïse went, speculating Eloïse is frigid and shallow. Sophia is embarrassed to see Eloïse is in the apartment. Envious and concerned about Karim entering into an increasingly serious relationship, Sophia watches Eloïse as she interacts with Karim. Eloïse and Karim take Sophia to a dinner, and Eloïse also brings her best friend Jasmin, a male midwife. Concerned she has been lured into a double date, Sophia is offended when Jasmin says giving birth is the most important event of a woman's life; Sophia never wants to have children. Jasmin and Sophia share a taxi, and Jasmin asks to see her again, though Sophia is reluctant. Eloïse then joins Karim and Sophia in a dinner with their parents. There, Sophia engages in a heated argument over her family, saying the world is overpopulated (when Eloïse expresses a desire for children) and her eight years of education were for nothing. Sophia storms out and refuses to apologize. She leaves Karim's apartment for a room at Jasmin's apartment; she also accepts a job as a French-language tutor for immigrants in the suburbs. Jasmin and Sophia have sex; the next morning, Sophia rushes to her new job and struggles on where to begin. Sophia visits Eloïse in her office and tearfully apologizes for her behaviour at their last dinner. She confesses she had never seen her brother so happy. Eloïse replies by comparing the sibling relationship to atomic theory; since people are made up of atoms, they inherit their atoms from their parents, and she understands Karim and Sophia share a connection. ==Cast== * Anne-Élisabeth Bossé as Sophia * Patrick Hivon as Karim * Evelyne Brochu as Eloïse * Mani Soleymanlou as Jasmin * Magalie Lépine- Blondeau as Anabelle Lajoie * Sasson Gabai as Hichem * Niels Schneider as Alex * Mylène Mackay as Emilie * Micheline Bernard as Lucie ==Accolades== Award Date of ceremony Category Recipient(s) Result Canadian Screen Awards 28 May 2020 Best Cinematography Josée Deshaies Canadian Screen Awards Best Costume Design Patricia McNeil Cannes Film Festival 14–25 May 2019 Jury Coup de Coeur Monia Chokri Prix collégial du cinéma québécois 2020 Best Film A Brother's Love "Antigone remporte le Prix collégial du cinéma québécois".

24725460	A Brown Thanksgiving	"A Brown Thanksgiving" is the seventh episode of The Cleveland Show. The episode aired on November 22, 2009 on Fox in the United States. In this episode Cleveland Brown celebrates his first Thanksgiving with his new family, including his own parents and Donna's Auntie Momma. ==Plot== Cleveland celebrates Thanksgiving with his new family and his parents, Cookie and LeVar "Freight Train" Brown. Things become hostile until Donna's Auntie Momma arrives and diffuses the situation. Cleveland soon discovers that Auntie Momma is a partial trans woman after he sees her urinating while standing. He tries to tell Donna but refrains because she would be crushed to learn the truth. LeVar becomes smitten with Auntie Momma, and Cleveland, after years of LeVar being a jerk to his own son, believes it is best that his father find out the hard way. Cleveland also learns from Rallo that he had known all along from sitting on Auntie Momma's lap, and agrees to keep quiet out of a desire to see the reaction. When LeVar and Auntie Momma come back down from having sex, they start teasing each other at dinner by subtly acting out their antics with the food. Cleveland becomes so disgusted and surprised that his father did not notice that he vomits all over the table. Meanwhile, Roberta decides to spend a romantic Thanksgiving together with Federline, but Donna refuses to let her. Only Auntie Momma's influence convinces Donna to let her leave. As the couple kiss by a river, Federline's car is stolen by two homeless men. They track the car to a mission where the poor (including Lester's family) are eating, being served by the Bear family. The homeless man who stole the car gives back the keys. Roberta notices the unity around her and realizes that family is more important. She returns home and apologizes to her mother. Later, Cleveland confronts Auntie Momma and learns that she is actually her uncle Kevin, who was acting as a strong, female influence for Donna in place of her neglectful mother. Since she sees that Cleveland will take good care of Donna, "Auntie Momma" decides that it is time to leave. Soon after, Cleveland tells his father the truth, causing him to vomit over the front porch before convincing him not to reveal the truth to Donna (to which LeVar states that he indends to downplay the whole situation in general) and demanding that he reconcile with Cookie. ==Production== The episode also introduces Cleveland's father, Freight Train, who is portrayed by Craig Robinson, Cleveland's mother, Cookie, who is portrayed by Frances Callier, and Auntie Momma, who is portrayed by Kym Whitley. ==Reception== The episode was viewed by 6.32 million people being the third most viewed episode in its time slot. The A.V. Club Emily VanDerWerff graded the episode a C+, stating "It's not a big deal if these shows don't want to do complicated character development (Lord knows Family Guy didn't need it), but Cleveland Show has headed in this direction so often that I was a bit disappointed the episode didn't tie all of this together better". "A Brown Thanksgiving" came under fire from the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) after Bil Browning of the LGBT blog The Bilerico Project expressed shock at the organization's lack of response to the portrayal of a transgender character. GLAAD released a statement that it had already been in contact with Fox and the show's producers as "part of an ongoing discussion that GLAAD is having with Fox regarding consistent homophobic and transphobic jokes in some of its animated programming. The problematic transgender episode Bilerico points to is one of several instances that the Entertainment Team will be discussing with them, as well as advocating for more fair LGBT inclusion." Speaking with LGBT media website AfterElton.com in January 2010, series creator Seth MacFarlane said "It always distresses me when I hear that the gay community is upset with us, because that's one group of people I hope would know we're on their side." However, in May 2010 MacFarlane again drew GLAAD's ire when, in the Family Guy episode "Quagmire's Dad", another character (Brian) also reacts to learning he had sex with a trans woman by vomiting for close to 30 seconds. ==See also== *"Quagmire's Dad" – a Family Guy episode that also received negative reception for its portrayal of a transgender character ==References== ==External links== * Category:2009 American television episodes Category:The Cleveland Show (season 1) episodes Category:American LGBT-related television episodes Category:Animation controversies in television Category:LGBT-related controversies in animation Category:LGBT-related controversies in television Category:Thanksgiving television episodes Category:Transgender-related television episodes Category:Television controversies in the United States Category:Television episodes about anti-LGBT sentiment Category:LGBT-related animated television episodes it:Episodi di The Cleveland Show (prima stagione)#Il giorno del ringraziamento
6249796	A Brush with Fame	A Brush with Fame is a British lifestyle game show that aired on ITV from 10 October to 4 November 2005 and hosted by Carol Smillie. ==Background== The programme series was initially piloted by Granada Television using the name Celebrity Face Paint. ==Format== The series took place in each of nine UK regions involving 900 contestants. One hundred people in each of the regions were given half an hour to produce a self-portrait using materials supplied by the programmers. Then, while the artists took a break, Carol and the two judges, Christian Furr and David Lee looked at the painted pictures and chose twenty five people to go into the next round and paint a celebrity guest. The artists could then use their own materials and any medium. Out of the 25, the judges then chose 10 who would go on to the next round and paint a second celebrity. Out of the 10, one finalist was selected and also one wild card show contestant who would compete with 8 others from the other regions in a wild card show for the chance to join the nine finalists in London. The final challenged the ten finalists to paint a portrait of Coronation Street actor Malcolm Hebden, who was dressed as a clown. The winner received a cheque for £10,000 and also the opportunity to turn professional, with the offer of a deal with leading art publisher, Washington Green. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2005 British television series debuts Category:2005 British television series endings Category:ITV (TV network) original programming Category:Television series by ITV Studios
7095820	A Brush with the Law	"A Brush with the Law" is the eleventh episode of the fifth series of the British comedy series Dad's Army. It was originally transmitted on 15 December 1972. ==Synopsis== Mainwaring is charged with showing a light, contrary to blackout rules, and is taken to court by a cheerful ARP Warden Hodges. As if that was not enough, the magistrate is none other than his old nemesis Captain Square. The Verger tries to warn off Hodges, but Hodges will not back down. The platoon tries to help by testifying as witnesses to Mainwaring's innocence, but things go from bad to worse when Jones messes up his story under oath. As both Square and Hodges proceed to push Mainwaring towards what could be a sticky end, Walker steps in and reveals he was out delivering 'supplies' to a 'nearby customer', putting some pressure on Square by reminding him of his own illegal activities buying blackmarket whisky. Just as Square is about to dismiss the trial, the Verger confesses it was he who showed the light, having used the office after the platoon had left on patrol to write his memoirs, much to the fury of Hodges who has lost his chance to end Mainwaring. The case is dismissed and Mainwaring is allowed to leave the court "without a stain on his character". He attributes his acquittal to "honesty, fair play and the integrity of British justice". ==Cast== *Arthur Lowe as Captain Mainwaring *John Le Mesurier as Sergeant Wilson *Clive Dunn as Lance Corporal Jones *John Laurie as Private Frazer *James Beck as Private Walker *Arnold Ridley as Private Godfrey *Ian Lavender as Private Pike *Bill Pertwee as ARP Warden Hodges *Geoffrey Lumsden as Captain Square *Frank Williams as The Vicar *Edward Sinclair as The Verger *Stuart Sherwin as Junior Warden Reg Adamson *Jeffrey Gardiner as Mr Wintergreen *Marjorie Wilde as Lady Magistrate *Chris Gannon as Mr Bone, the Clerk of the Court *Toby Perkins as Usher ==Notes== #Mainwaring is prosecuted under the Emergency Powers (Defence) Act 1939, which had been rushed onto the statute book by the government under public pressure.

5590094	A Bucket of Blood (1995 film)	A Bucket of Blood, also known as The Death Artist, is a 1995 American comedy horror television film remake of the 1959 film of the same name. The 1995 remake follows the original closely, adapting it to a contemporary setting. The film was directed by comedian Michael McDonald, produced by Roger Corman, who produced and directed the original film, and cowritten by McDonald and Brendan Broderick, based on the 1959 screenplay by Charles B. Griffith. The plot revolves around Walter Paisley (Anthony Michael Hall), a socially awkward busboy working at the Jabberjaw, an alternative coffee house which hosts performance art, poetry readings and live music. Walter wants to be an artist to impress his co-worker Carla (Justine Bateman), but lacks talent. While attempting to create an original sculpture, he accidentally kills his landlady's cat, and hides the dead animal by covering it in plaster and passing it off as a statue. After being acclaimed as a great artist, Walter begins to commit murder to produce new art. The cast also includes cameos by David Cross, Paul Bartel, Mink Stole, Jennifer Coolidge and Will Ferrell, in his film debut. The film premiered on Showtime as the tenth episode of Roger Corman Presents, a series of made-for-cable films produced by Corman. == Plot == At a Los Angeles coffee house called the Jabberjaw, several performance artists vie for the attention of Generation X hipsters, including Maxwell (Shadoe Stevens), a poet who declares that "life is nothing but a homeless traveler on the RTD of art", Mayolia (Sheila Travis), who performs monologues holding a toy monkey, Cuff and Link (Victor Wilson and Patrick Bristow), a pair of sarcastic photographers who intentionally run over animals and photograph the road kill, and "Stupid Girl" (Jennifer Coolidge), who strips nude on stage while playing cello. Other regular attendants at the cafe include an older rich couple (Paul Bartel and Mink Stole) looking for art by new talent, and Lou (Kin Shriner), an undercover cop trying to bust heroin dealers operating in the cafe. Working for Leonard (Sam Lloyd) are busboy Walter (Anthony Michael Hall) and Italian hostess Carla (Justine Bateman). To impress Carla, who he has a crush on, Walter tries to produce a clay sculpture of her face, but is unsuccessful due to his lack of talent. He hears his landlady's cat Frankie in the wall, discovering that the animal had been mistakenly plastered into the wall, and attempts to cut it out with a knife, but accidentally kills it. The next morning, Walter decides to cover up the dead animal with plaster and presents it as a "thing I made" called Dead Cat. The regulars and other artists love the "sculpture", and Mayolia gives Walter a necklace containing a nickel bag of heroin, leading Lou to follow Walter back to his apartment and confront him about it, which ends with Walter killing Lou with his frying pan, later deciding to hide the body in plaster and call it "Murdered Man". Leonard, having discovered the dead animal in Walter's first "statue", initially tries to call the police upon hearing about "Murdered Man", but covers up the murder, when a customer offers Leonard a large amount of money for "Dead Cat". At a party for Walter, Alice (Darcy DeMoss), who had not been aware of Walter's popularity, insults him, but agrees to pose for his nude statue. At his apartment, Alice taunts Walter, suggesting he is a virgin, and he strangles her to death. Walter reveals his true feelings for Carla at an art show, only for her to tell him that she doesn't love him, and he immediately asks her to model for him. However, she discovers Walter's dark nature when she finds Alice's body in the nude "sculpture", and runs away from Walter upon learning that he plans to murder her next. Once art critics begin commenting on the "brilliance" of a "creation within a creation", Lou's police partner breaks apart the "statues", revealing the corpses. The officer, along with Walter's friends, run after Walter and Carla, realizing that the artist is a murderer, and, realizing that he is about to be caught, Walter mixes a new batch of plaster, and the cop breaks down the door, revealing to the group that Walter has spattered his body with plaster and hanged himself. The experience leaves Carla mute, Leonard to burn down the Jabberjaw for insurance money and Maxwell to unsuccessfully imitate Walter's "suicide art", dying in the process. Cuff and Link, who always criticized Walter's art and accused him of fraud, finally become successful artists themselves, and live together as roommates, while Mayolia becomes the host of a successful children's television show. ==Cast== ==Production== Anthony Michael Hall was cast because of his roles in the Brat Pack movies of the 1980s. ”That's what people identify him with, for better or worse,” said associate producer Darin Spillman. ”We were remaking a 1950s film and wanted someone identified with a new generation.” ==Reception== Joe Bob Briggs gave the film four stars, saying "They hardly changed the flick at all. It's the same goldurn movie." Allmovie's Fred Beldin wrote, "Although executive producer Corman was probably pleased to see his work refashioned with the gratuitous gore and nudity he couldn't use the first time around, Death Artist is fairly pointless." ==References== == External links == * * A Bucket of Blood on YouTube * * *A Bucket of Blood at Letterbox DVD Category:1995 television films Category:1995 films Category:1995 comedy horror films Category:American black comedy films Category:American comedy horror films Category:Remakes of American films Category:Horror film remakes Category:American horror television films Category:Films produced by Roger Corman Category:Films about sculptors Category:Films set in apartment buildings Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:American drama television films Category:1990s American films Category:Films about heroin Category:Films about the illegal drug trade
55980982	A Bucket of Brains	A Bucket of Brains is a studio EP/CD by the Flamin' Groovies, primarily consisting of seven songs recorded by the group while living in England and recording for the British branch of United Artists Records ("UA") in 1972. The songs were intended to form the basis of the Groovies' fourth studio album, to be entitled A Bucket of Brains. Six of the songs (recorded in May and August 1972 at Rockfield Studios in Wales) were produced by Dave Edmunds, while the seventh (recorded in August 1972 at De Lane Lea Studios in London) was produced by Groovies' leader Cyril Jordan (using the pseudonym "Flowerboy Venus"). The eighth song on the album is the original "correct speed" studio version of the Groovies' most famous song, "Shake Some Action". Although four of the songs were released on two singles by UA, their failure to chart caused UA to terminate the sessions (and the group's contract) at the end of 1972 without finishing the album, and the group returned to the USA before Christmas. However, the unissued recordings of two of those songs ("Shake Some Action" and "You Tore Me Down") later became the centerpiece of the Groovies' most successful album, Shake Some Action, in 1976. An unofficial version of this album, entitled The Rockfield Session, was issued by the group's Australian record label, AIM Records, in 1989, with liner notes by Cyril Jordan. However, that EP was transcribed from a copy of the recordings owned by Jordan, did not use the original master recordings of the sessions, and was characterized as sounding "a bit muddy". EMI, which purchased UA in 1979, decided to release a legitimate version of the recordings, taken from the original masters, in 1995.Storey, Jon. Liner notes to A Bucket of Brains (1995). Retrieved 4 December 2017. ==Background== During most of the recording of Teenage Head in January 1971, Groovies' guitarist Tim Lynch was in jail; thus, almost all of the guitars on the album were performed by Cyril Jordan.Jordan, Cyril. Liner notes to Slow Death (2002). Retrieved 5 December 2017. After the album was finished, Jordan wanted to replace Lynch with guitarist James Ferrell, whom Jordan had met through fellow guitarist Mike Wilhelm. Band co-leader Roy Loney, who had originally started the band with Lynch, agreed but had become disenchanted with the music business. Then the band was dropped by its label, Kama Sutra Records, shortly before the release of Teenage Head over financial disputes. Soon thereafter, Loney also decided to leave the band and was replaced by Chris Wilson, the vocalist/guitarist from Wilhelm's band "Loose Gravel". However, the group now had no recording contract and also little money. One of the Groovies' fans (to whom the Groovies included a dedication on Teenage Head) was Andrew Lauder, then head of the UA label in Britain. Groovies' bassist George Alexander had sent a letter to Lauder after the band's release by Kama Sutra, noting that they were looking for a new label. The Groovies were surprised when Lauder responded, telling them to meet with Martin Cerf, creative services director of United Artists Records in Los Angeles.Jordan, Cyril. Liner notes to The Rockfield Sessions (1989). Retrieved 5 December 2017. Lauder had recently been successful in having Cerf and the American branch of United Artists sign several of his acts with prior major-label releases, including The Move / Electric Light Orchestra, Family, and Brinsley Schwarz, despite the fact that UA was generally downsizing. However, Cerf turned out to have no interest in signing the Groovies, telling Jordan, "You're through." Before leaving the UA offices, Jordan ran into another UA employee, an acquaintance who had managed Ike & Tina Turner, and told him about Lauder's message and Cerf's rejection. The acquaintance took Jordan into his office, and the two of them then called Lauder in London. As a result, two weeks later Jordan was in London, where Lauder and British UA told him that they could offer the Groovies a contract right then as long as the band temporarily moved to Britain, which Jordan agreed to do. One of the reasons for moving the band was the opportunity to work with British musician/producer Dave Edmunds at Rockfield Studios; in Jordan's words, "“When we heard [Edmunds’ version of] ‘I Hear You Knockin'’ in 1969, the sound on the record was so great that we thought Rockfield was the new Sun recording studios." Lauder assured the band that this would be no problem since Edmunds already produced several acts for UA, and Jordan then discussed it in interviews about the group's signing to UA. However, no one from either the band or UA had contacted Edmunds, who read in the British music press (Melody Maker) that he was supposed to be producing the Groovies on the same day in May 1972 that the band arrived at Rockfield. Because he lived nearby, Edmunds decided to show up to meet the Groovies and see if he actually wanted to work with them. The Groovies, knowing nothing about this, spent about three hours asking Edmunds questions about his own influences, one of which prompted the composition of a new Groovies song, "You Tore Me Down". By the end of this introduction, there was no doubt that the Groovies and Edmunds wanted to work together, and they promptly cut four songs: three originals, "Shake Some Action", "You Tore Me Down", and "Slow Death", and one Chuck Berry cover, "Little Queenie". However, the welcome given to an American group by a British label spurred a backlash in the U.K., despite the fact that the Groovies had been living in a leased house in London and touring constantly throughout Europe since arriving,In the Slow Death liner notes, Jordan estimated that the band played at least 200 gigs in Europe during 1972. and so UA decided instead to release a series of singles to introduce the band to the British audience. As a result, the Groovies returned to Rockfield in August to cut two more tracks, both covers: "Get a Shot of Rhythm and Blues" and "Married Woman". Due to other commitments, they then returned to London to cut one more cover, "Tallahassee Lassie", but Edmunds was unable to attend this session, so Jordan produced the track. During this time, the Groovies came up with a name for their upcoming album, thought up by the group's road manager. Wilson noted that "Brains" was the name of a popular beer in South Wales, and after a particularly hard day of touring, the road manager had ordered "a bucket of Brains" at a local bar, and the name stuck. However, their first UA single, "Slow Death", was banned by the BBC for using the word "morphine" in the lyrics and so failed to chart in the U.K., which caused UA to lose interest in actually finishing the Groovies album. Prior to Christmas 1972, the Groovies were told by UA to return to the US for the holidays, and UA would get back in touch following the new year, but the Groovies never heard from UA again. Jordan said that "I was at the same point as I was with Kama Sutra and Epic [the Groovies' prior major labels], let's get rid of these guys and get with someone else." ==Subsequent developments== Although Jordan and Wilson had pushed for "Shake Some Action" and "You Tore Me Down" to be issued as singles, those two originals, along with the cover "Little Queenie", were never issued at all by UA, and the Groovies ended up owning the master tapes to these three songs. UA had objected to "Shake Some Action" because of its almost five-minute length, and so Edmunds produced a version slightly speeding the song up and so making it almost 30 seconds shorter, but UA also turned this version down. Back in the US in 1973, Jordan produced a version that was only about three-and-a-half minutes long, but that version was then also turned down by Capitol. In 1974, the Groovies allowed Greg Shaw's Bomp! Records to release the Rockfield version of "You Tore Me Down" as a single, and in 1975 Shaw was able to sign the group to Sire Records. Sire owner Seymour Stein, who loved Edmunds' production (including the "sped-up" version of "Shake Some Action"), acquired the rights to both originals from the band and released them on the Groovies' 1976 debut for Sire, which was also called Shake Some Action and was also produced by Edmunds. In 1979, the music magazine Bucketfull of Brains was founded, taking its name from the unreleased album. In 1989, the Flamin' Groovies were recording for the Australian label AIM Records, when Jordan, pursuant to a 1987 conversation with Dave Edmunds during a Groovies tour, decided to allow AIM to release his copy, with some overdubs, of the 1972 Rockfield sessions as an EP, which was simply titled The Rockfield Sessions. According to the liner notes, one of Jordan's motives was trying to spur Edmunds to make an official release of the original UA masters. The official release of the seven master recordings on EMI followed on CD in 1995, including the "correct speed" original version of "Shake Some Action" as an extra track, moving the CD closer to album length instead of EP length. When EMI was acquired by Universal Music Group in 2011, the European Commission required that the rights to most artists signed to the British branches of EMI labels (including UA) be divested by Universal Music Group.

35235985	A Buddy Story	A Buddy Story is a 2010 independent film directed by Marc Erlbaum. It stars Gavin Bellour, Mad Men’s Elisabeth Moss and Matisyahu, a popular American reggae and alternative rock musician who makes his screen debut in the movie. In early 2012, Warner Brothers acquired the rights for the video-on-demand release of A Buddy Story. ==Plot== Buddy Gilbert (Gavin Bellour) is a struggling musician living in NYC. He spends his days touring the northeast with his pet turtle, playing community centers, dive bars and coffee shops because, he says, it beats a 9-to-5. One day, Buddy overhears his neighbor Susan (Elisabeth Moss) get in a particularly bad argument with her boyfriend and, although he barely knows her, he finds himself taking her out for some cheer-me-up ice cream. When Buddy is leaving the following day for a tour, Susan asks if she can tag along, if for no other reason than to get out of the city a while. Hesitant at first, Buddy obliges, and finds himself spending a week traveling around with someone who, just days before, was no more than "the girl on the other side of the wall". From a rough biker bar to a 100-year-old birthday party and other odd stops along the way, record label rejections to family connections, Buddy and Susan make their way from NYC to Philadelphia's Main Line, and they come to realize that it's not the road's end that matters, but rather the road itself. ==Cast== *Gavin Bellour as Buddy *Elisabeth Moss as Susan *Lee Garlington as Susan's Mom *Matisyahu as Chassid *Annabelle Gurwitch as Rita *Tovah Feldshuh as Buddy's Mom *Tim Guinee as Pete *Dick Latessa as Grandfather *Catherine A.

4066026	A Bug's Land	"A Bug's Land" (stylized "a bug's land") was an area of Disney California Adventure themed after the 1998 Disney·Pixar film A Bug's Life. The land consisted of Flik's Fun Fair, which opened on October 7, 2002, and was set in a representation of the film's fictional universe with four rides targeted towards young children; Flik's Flyers, Francis' Ladybug Boogie, Tuck and Roll's Drive 'Em Buggies, and Heimlich's Chew Chew Train. The area also included a water play area targeted towards young children. An outside area contained the It's Tough to Be a Bug! theater, which was an original area of the park when it opened on February 8, 2001. ==History== It's Tough to Be a Bug! and Bountiful Valley Farm were original attractions at Disney California Adventure when the park opened on February 8, 2001; both were originally part of the sprawling "Golden State" area. The park suffered from low attendance in its early years, partially attributed to the lack of rides appropriate for young children and the low proportion of E ticket attractions to stores and restaurants. In response, Disney announced it would concurrently build The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror – a recreation of an attraction at Disney's Hollywood Studios – in the Hollywood Pictures Backlot; and Flik's Fun Fair – a collection of four rides and a water play area geared towards children and themed to the movie A Bug's Life – adjacent to the existing It's Tough to Be a Bug! theater. The fictional backstory for Flik's Fun Fair holds that Flik and the other bugs were inspired to create their own fun fair when Disney's California Adventure opened next door to them. When the Imagineers set out to build The Twilight Zone Tower of Terror, they discovered the bugs in the garden and decided to open up Flik's fair to park guests. left|thumb|175x175px|A Bug's Land in 2015 Flik's Fun Fair opened on October 7, 2002, and became part of A Bug's Land, the new name for the collection of A Bug's Life-related attractions. Concurrently, Its Tough to Be a Bug! and Bountiful Valley Farm were transferred from Golden State to A Bug's Land, and the area's store was re-themed with more focus on the film's characters. In 2010, Bountiful Valley Farm as well as the area's shops and restaurants were closed and demolished; their site is now part of Cars Land, which opened on June 15, 2012. With the construction of Cars Land, two new entrances from Hollywood Land and Cars Land to the Flik's Fun Fair area were opened; the area originally had one entrance. On March 20, 2018, it was announced that A Bug's Land would close permanently, as the land became the site for Avengers Campus. It's Tough to Be a Bug! closed one day earlier, while the remainder of the land closed on September 4, 2018. Tributes to A Bug's Land can be found in Avengers Campus. Enlarged Christmas lights are seen hanging at the Pym Tasting Lab, and in the pre-show of Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure, there is a claw machine with numerous items. One of the items included is a pair of 3D glasses from It's Tough to Be a Bug!. In addition, there is a tribute to Bountiful Valley Farm on the labels of the enlarged ketchup and mustard bottles found inside the Pym Test Kitchen. ==Attractions at the time of closure== The following attractions were open at the time of A Bug's Land's closure in 2018. ===Flik's Flyers=== Flik's Flyers was a spinner ride at "Flik's Fun Fair" inside A Bug's Land at Disney California Adventure Park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. Guests rode in Flik's bug-made contraption fashioned from man-made objects. The vehicles appeared to have been fashioned from used food containers and have been stitched together by leaves and twigs to become balloons that whirled around a pie plate centerpiece. Whirring, cranking gears are heard as they leave the ground. The attraction provided guests with a view of Guardians of the Galaxy – Mission: Breakout!. Flik's Flyers was similar to Blowfish Balloon Race at Tokyo DisneySea. After the attraction's closure, it was re-themed into Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind, inspired by Pixar's Inside Out, and relocated to the Pixar Pier area of the park. ===Heimlich's Chew Chew Train=== Guests boarded a train in the shape of Heimlich, the German-accented caterpillar from the film. Heimlich (voiced by Joe Ranft) narrated the ride through speakers along the track. Heimlich's tendency to overeat was the theme of the ride, as the train appears to eat through oversized portions of human foods: candy corn, animal crackers, carrots, and watermelon. The scent of watermelon and animal crackers were piped in. After the ride closed in 2018, one of the cars from the attraction was moved to the headquarters of Pixar Animation Studios in memory of Ranft, who died in 2005. In addition, some of the attraction's audio of Heimlich was reused for Heimlich's Candy Corn Toss, one of the boardwalk games located in Pixar Pier. ===Francis' Ladybug Boogie=== Francis' Ladybug Boogie was a spinning attraction and first opened in 2002, along with the rest of A Bug's Land. Guests boarded one of the six Francis Lady bugs with up to six adults and children aboard each bug. The ride spun guests around in a figure eight style. The theme of the ride was the character Francis from the Disney·Pixar film A Bug's Life. The ride featured jazz music as guests are spun around to the music. ===Princess Dot Puddle Park=== Princess Dot's Puddle Park was a water-type play area designed by Walt Disney Imagineering located inside of A Bug's Land section of Disney California Adventure. The area featured an oversized garden hose nozzle that sprayed water at guests as well as a giant spigot that spurted water. This area provided the sensation of being a bug among the oversized garden tools. ===Tuck and Roll's Drive 'Em Buggies=== Tuck and Roll's Drive 'Em Buggies was a bumper car ride located inside of the A Bug's Land section of Disney California Adventure. In the attraction, up to two people could fit inside a bug-shaped bumper car, as they rode around bumping other cars. There were restrictions on who could drive the car. If riding alone, the driver must have been seven years or older. There was also a height restriction on this ride; all riders had to be at least 36 inches (91 cm) tall. There were a total of 21 bumper cars on the floor at a time. During the ride the car talked to the guests with the voices of pill bugs Tuck or Roll, depending on the assigned car. ==Other former attractions== * Bountiful Valley Farm ** Farmer's Market ** Sam Andreas Shakes ** P.T.

460442	A Bug's Life	A Bug's Life is a 1998 American computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios for Walt Disney Pictures as its second feature-length film, following Toy Story (1995). Directed by John Lasseter and co-directed by Andrew Stanton from a screenplay written by Stanton, Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw and a story conceived by Lasseter, Stanton and Joe Ranft, the film stars the voices of Dave Foley, Kevin Spacey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. In the film, a misfit ant named Flik, looks for "tough warriors" to save his ant colony from a protection racket run by a gang of grasshoppers. Unfortunately, the "warriors" he brings back turn out to be an inept troupe of Circus Bugs. The film's plot was initially inspired by Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Production on A Bug's Life began shortly after the release of Toy Story in 1995. The ants in the film were redesigned to be more appealing, and Pixar's animation unit employed technical innovations in computer animation. Randy Newman composed the music for the film. During production, a controversial public feud erupted between Steve Jobs and Lasseter of Pixar and DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg due to the parallel production of his similar film Antz, which was released the same year. The film was released worldwide on November 20, 1998, received positive reviews and became a commercial success, having grossed $363 million at the box office. It was the first film to be digitally transferred frame-by-frame and released on DVD, and has been released multiple times on home video. ==Plot== A colony of ants, led by the elderly Queen and her daughter Princess Atta, live in the middle of a seasonally dry creekbed on a small hill known as "Ant Island". Every summer, they are forced to give food to a gang of bullying grasshoppers, led by Hopper. One day, a courageous but clumsy inventor ant named Flik accidentally destroys the food offering with his grain harvester. Hopper discovers this, and demands twice as much food as compensation. When Flik earnestly suggests the ants enlist the help of bigger bugs to fight the grasshoppers, Atta sees it as a way to get rid of Flik and sends him off. Flik travels to "the city", a heap of trash under a trailer. Flik mistakes a troupe of jobless Circus Bugs for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent, and agree to travel with him back to Ant Island. During a welcome ceremony after their arrival, the Circus Bugs and Flik discover their mutual misunderstandings. The Circus Bugs attempt to leave, but are pursued by a nearby bird; while fleeing, they rescue Atta's younger sister Dot from the bird, gaining the ants' respect. At Flik's request, the Circus Bugs continue the ruse of being "warriors", thus enabling them to continue enjoying the ants' hospitality. Learning that Hopper fears birds inspires Flik to build a crewed ornithopter disguised as a bird to scare away the grasshoppers. Meanwhile, Hopper reminds his gang of the ants' superior numbers, warning them the ants will rebel if not kept in line. The ants finish constructing the fake bird. During the subsequent celebration, the Circus Bugs' old boss, P.T. Flea, arrives, seeking to rehire them and blowing their cover; the ants exile Flik and the Circus Bugs, and desperately attempt to gather food for a new offering. Hopper returns, sees the mediocre offering and takes over the island. He then demands the ants' own winter food supply, planning to execute the Queen afterward. Overhearing the plan, Dot persuades Flik and the Circus Bugs to return to Ant Island. After the Circus Bugs distract the grasshoppers long enough to rescue the Queen, Flik deploys the bird. It initially fools the grasshoppers, but P.T., who is also fooled, sets the bird on fire. Realizing the deception, Hopper has Flik publicly beaten to teach the ants a lesson, proclaiming that the ants are lowly life forms who live solely to serve the grasshoppers. Flik asserts that Hopper actually fears the colony, because he has always known what they are capable of. This inspires the ants and the Circus Bugs to fight back against the grasshoppers, driving all but Hopper away. The ants shove Hopper into the circus cannon to shoot him off of the island, but rain suddenly begins to fall. In the ensuing chaos, Hopper frees himself from the cannon and abducts Flik. The Circus Bugs and Atta pursue, with the latter catching up to Hopper and rescuing Flik, who lures Hopper to the real bird's nest. Believing the bird is another fake, Hopper taunts it, until it grabs him and feeds him to its chicks. With the anthill now at peace, Flik improves his inventions to help gather food for the ants. Flik and Atta become a couple, and proceed to send Hopper's affable brother Molt and a few ants to help P.T. and the Circus Bugs on their new tour. Atta and Dot become the new Queen and Princess. The ants celebrate their victory and congratulate Flik as a hero. They then bid a fond farewell to the circus troupe. ==Voice cast== ==Production== ===Development=== During the summer of 1994, Pixar's story department began turning their thoughts to their next film.Price, p. 157 The storyline for A Bug's Life originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter and Joe Ranft, the studio's head story team; other films such as Monsters, Inc., Finding Nemo and WALL-E were also conceived at this lunch.Price, p. 158 Lasseter and his story team had already been drawn to the idea of insects serving as characters. Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film The Grasshopper and the Ants. In addition, Walt Disney Feature Animation had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled Army Ants, that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized. As Stanton and Ranft discussed the adaptation, they rattled off scenarios and storylines springing from their premise. Lasseter liked the idea and offered some suggestions. The concept simmered until early 1995, when the story team began work on the second film in earnest. During an early test screening for Toy Story in San Rafael in June 1995, they pitched the film to Disney CEO Michael Eisner. Eisner thought the idea was fine and they submitted a treatment to Disney in early July under the title Bugs. Disney approved the treatment and gave notice on July 7 that it was exercising the option of a second film under the original 1991 agreement between Disney and Pixar.Price, p. 159 Lasseter assigned the co-director job to Stanton; both worked well together and had similar sensibilities. Lasseter had realized that working on a computer-animated feature as a sole director was dangerous while the production of Toy Story was in process. In addition, Lasseter believed that it would relieve stress and that the role would groom Stanton for having his own position as a lead director.Price, p. 160 ===Writing=== In The Ant and the Grasshopper, a grasshopper squanders the spring and summer months on singing while the ants put food away for the winter; when winter comes, the hungry grasshopper begs the ants for food, but the ants turn him away. Andrew Stanton and Joe Ranft hit on the notion that the grasshopper could just take the food.Pixar Animation Studios, official website, feature films, A Bugs Life, The inspiration After Stanton had completed a draft of the script, he came to doubt one of the story's main pillars – that the Circus Bugs that had come to the colony to cheat the ants would instead stay and fight. He thought the Circus Bugs were unlikable characters as liars and that it was unrealistic for them to undergo a complete personality change. Also, no particularly good reason existed for Circus Bugs to stay with the ant colony during the second act.A Bugs Life, DVD Commentary Although the film was already far along, Stanton concluded that the story needed a different approach. Stanton took one of the early circus bug characters, Red the red ant, and changed him into the character Flik. The Circus Bugs, no longer out to cheat the colony, would be embroiled in a comic misunderstanding as to why Flik was recruiting them. Lasseter agreed with this new approach, and comedy writers Donald McEnery and Bob Shaw spent a few months working on further polishing with Stanton.Price, p. 161 The characters "Tuck and Roll" were inspired by a drawing that Stanton did of two bugs fighting when he was in the second grade. Lasseter had come to envision the film as an epic in the tradition of David Lean's 1962 film Lawrence of Arabia. ===Casting=== The voice cast was heavy with television sitcom stars of the time: Flik was voiced by Dave Foley (from NewsRadio), Princess Atta was voiced by Julia Louis-Dreyfus (from Seinfeld), Molt was voiced by Richard Kind (from Spin City), Slim was voiced by David Hyde Pierce (from Frasier) and Dim was voiced by Brad Garrett (from Everybody Loves Raymond). Joe Ranft, member of Pixar's story team, played Heimlich the caterpillar at the suggestion of Lasseter's wife, Nancy, who had heard him playing the character on a scratch vocal track. The casting of Hopper, the film's villain, proved problematic. Lasseter's top choice was Robert De Niro, who repeatedly turned the part down, as did a succession of other actors. Kevin Spacey met John Lasseter at the 1995 Academy Awards and Lasseter asked Spacey if he would be interested in doing the voice of Hopper. Spacey was delighted and signed on immediately. A Bug's Life was the final film appearance of actor Roddy McDowall, who played Mr. Soil, dying shortly before the film's theatrical release. ===Art design and animation=== It was more difficult for animators during the production of A Bug's Life than that of Toy Story, as Pixar's computers ran sluggishly due to the complexity of the character models. Lasseter and Stanton had two supervising animators, Rich Quade and Glenn McQueen, to assist with directing and reviewing the animation. The first sequence to be animated and rendered was the circus sequence that culminated with P.T. Flea's "Flaming Wall of Death". Lasseter placed this scene first in the pipeline because he believed it was "less likely to change". After Lasseter thought it would be useful to look at a view of the world from an insect's perspective, two technicians obliged by creating a miniature video camera on Lego wheels, dubbed the "Bugcam".A Bugs Life, DVD Behind the Scenes Fastened to the end of a stick, the Bugcam could roll through grass and other terrain and send back an insect's-eye outlook. Lasseter was intrigued by the way grass, leaves and flower petals formed a translucent canopy, as if the insects were living under a stained-glass ceiling. The team also later sought inspiration from Microcosmos (1996), a French documentary on love and violence in the insect world. The transition from treatment to storyboards took on an extra layer of complexity due to the profusion of storylines. While Toy Story focused heavily on Woody and Buzz Lightyear, with the other toys serving mostly as sidekicks, A Bug's Life required in-depth storytelling for several major groups of characters. Character design also presented a new challenge, in that the designers had to make ants appear likable. Although the animators and the art department studied insects more closely, natural realism would give way to the film's larger needs.Price, p. 162 The team took out mandibles and designed the ants to stand upright, replacing their normal six legs with two arms and two legs. The grasshoppers, in contrast, received a pair of extra appendages to appear less attractive. The story's scale also required software engineers to accommodate new demands. Among these was the need to handle shots with crowds of ants. The film would include more than 400 such shots in the ant colony, some with as many as 800. It was impractical for animators to control them individually, but neither could the ants remain static for even a moment without appearing lifeless, or move identically. Bill Reeves, one of the film's two supervising technical directors, dealt with the quandary by leading the development of software for autonomous ants. The animators would only animate four or five groups of about eight individual "universal ants". Each one of these "universal ants" would later be randomly distributed throughout the digital set. The program also allowed each ant to be automatically modified in subtle ways (e.g. different color of eye or skin, different heights, different weights, etc.). This ensured that no two ants were the same. It was partly based on Reeves's invention of particle systems a decade and a half earlier, which had let animators use masses of self-guided particles to create effects like swirling dust and snow.Price, p. 163 The animators also employed subsurface scattering—developed by Pixar co-founder Edwin Catmull during his graduate student days at the University of Utah in the 1970s—to render surfaces in a more lifelike way. This would be the first time that subsurface scattering would be used in a Pixar film, and a small team at Pixar worked out the practical problems that kept it from working in animation. Catmull asked for a short film to test and showcase subsurface scattering and the result, Geri's Game (1997), was attached alongside A Bug's Life in its theatrical release.Price, p. 173 ===Feud between Pixar and DreamWorks=== During the production of A Bug's Life, a public feud erupted between DreamWorks' Jeffrey Katzenberg, and Pixar's Steve Jobs and John Lasseter. Katzenberg, former chairman of Disney's film division, had left the company in a bitter feud with CEO Michael Eisner. In response, he formed DreamWorks SKG with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen and planned to rival Disney in animation. After DreamWorks' acquisition of Pacific Data Images (PDI)—long Pixar's contemporary in computer animation—Lasseter and others at Pixar were dismayed to learn from the trade papers that PDI's first project at DreamWorks would be another ant film, to be called Antz.Price, p. 170 By this time, Pixar's project was well known within the animation community.Price, p. 171 Both Antz and A Bug's Life center on a young male ant, a drone with oddball tendencies that struggles to win a princess's hand by saving their society. Whereas A Bug's Life relied chiefly on visual gags, Antz was more verbal and revolved more around satire. The script of Antz was also heavy with adult references, whereas Pixar's film was more accessible to children. It was clear that Lasseter and Jobs believed that the idea was stolen by Katzenberg. Katzenberg had stayed in touch with Lasseter after the acrimonious Disney split, often calling to check up. In October 1995, when Lasseter was overseeing postproduction work on Toy Story at the Universal lot's Technicolor facility in Universal City, where DreamWorks was also located, he called Katzenberg and dropped by with Stanton. When Katzenberg asked what they were doing next, Lasseter described what would become A Bug's Life in detail. Lasseter respected Katzenberg's judgment and felt comfortable using him as a sounding board for creative ideas.Price, p. 169 Lasseter had high hopes for Toy Story, and he was telling friends throughout the tight-knit computer- animation business to get cracking on their own films. He told various friends, "If this hits, it's going to be like space movies after Star Wars" for computer animation companies. Lasseter later recalled, "I should have been wary. Jeffrey kept asking questions about when it would be released." When the trades indicated production on Antz, Lasseter, feeling betrayed, called Katzenberg and asked him bluntly if it were true, who in turn asked him where he had heard the rumor. Lasseter asked again, and Katzenberg admitted it was true. Lasseter raised his voice and would not believe Katzenberg's story that a development director had pitched him the idea long ago. Katzenberg claimed Antz came from a 1991 story pitch by Tim Johnson that was related to Katzenberg in October 1994. Another source gives Nina Jacobson, one of Katzenberg's executives, as the person responsible for the Antz pitch. Lasseter, who normally did not use profane language, cursed at Katzenberg and hung up the phone. Lasseter recalled that Katzenberg began explaining that Disney was "out to get him" and that he realized that he was just cannon fodder in Katzenberg's fight with Disney. For his part, Katzenberg believed he was the victim of a conspiracy: Eisner had decided not to pay him his contract-required bonus, convincing Disney's board not to give him anything. Katzenberg was further angered by the fact that Eisner scheduled Bugs to open the same week as The Prince of Egypt, which was then intended to be DreamWorks' first animated release. Lasseter grimly relayed the news to Pixar employees but kept morale high. Privately, Lasseter told other Pixar executives that he and Stanton felt terribly let down by Katzenberg. Katzenberg moved the opening of Antz from spring 1999 to October 1998 to compete with Pixar's release. David Price writes in his 2008 book The Pixar Touch that a rumor, "never confirmed", was that Katzenberg had given PDI "rich financial incentives to induce them to whatever it would take to have Antz ready first, despite Pixar's head start". Jobs was furious and called Katzenberg and began yelling. Katzenberg made an offer: He would delay production of Antz if Jobs and Disney would move A Bug's Life so that it did not compete with The Prince of Egypt. Jobs believed it "a blatant extortion attempt" and would not go for it, explaining that there was nothing he could do to convince Disney to change the date. Katzenberg casually responded that Jobs himself had taught him how to conduct similar business long ago, explaining that Jobs had come to Pixar's rescue by making the deal for Toy Story, as Pixar was near bankruptcy at that time. Katzenberg said, "I was the one guy there for you back then, and now you're allowing them to use you to screw me." He suggested that if Jobs wanted to, he could simply slow down production on A Bug's Life without telling Disney. If he did, Katzenberg said, he would put Antz on hold. Lasseter also claimed Katzenberg had phoned him with the proposition, but Katzenberg denied these charges later.Price, p. 172 As the release dates for both films approached, Disney executives concluded that Pixar should keep silent on the DreamWorks battle. Regardless, Lasseter publicly dismissed Antz as a "schlock version" of A Bug's Life. Lasseter, who claimed to have never seen Antz, told others that if DreamWorks and PDI had made the film about anything other than insects, he would have closed Pixar for the day so the entire company could go see it.Price, p. 174 Jobs and Katzenberg would not back down and the rivaling ant films provoked a press frenzy. "The bad guys rarely win," Jobs told the Los Angeles Times. In response, DreamWorks' head of marketing Terry Press suggested, "Steve Jobs should take a pill." Despite the successful box office performance of both Antz and A Bug's Life, tensions would remain high between Jobs and Katzenberg for many years. According to Jobs, Katzenberg came to Jobs after the success of Shrek (2001) and insisted he had never heard the pitch for A Bug's Life, reasoning that his settlement with Disney would have given him a share of the profits if that were so. Although the contention left all parties estranged, Pixar and PDI employees kept up the old friendships that had arisen from spending a long time together in computer animation. ==Music== The film's score was composed and conducted by Randy Newman. Walt Disney Records released the soundtrack on October 27, 1998. The album's first track is a song called "The Time of Your Life" written and performed by Newman, while all the other 19 tracks are orchestral cues. Although the album was out of print physically in the United States during the 2000s, in June 2018 Universal Music Japan announced that a re-mastered edition would be released on October 3, 2018, along with other soundtrack albums from the Walt Disney Records pre-2018 catalogue. The album is also available for purchase on iTunes. The time duration is 47 minutes and 32 seconds. ==Release== A few weeks into the film's theatrical release, new outtakes were added to the theatrical prints. Because the film is animated, no actual outtakes exist; they are animated specifically for the outtakes sequence. === Screening === The film’s world premiere was on November 14, 1998, at the El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles. A few days before world premiere, the film was screened at Camp David.A Bug's Life crew roundtable. A Bug's Life Blu Ray disc special A day after the screening, the crew visited Oval Office in the White House. ===Home media=== A Bug's Life was the first home video release to be entirely created using a digital transfer. Every frame of animation was converted from the film's computer data, as opposed to the standard analog film-to-videotape transfer process. This allowed for the film's DVD release to retain its original 2.35:1 widescreen format. The DVD was released on April 20, 1999, alongside a VHS release which was presented in a standard 1.33:1 "fullscreen" format. The film's fullscreen transfer was performed by entirely "reframing" the film shot by shot; more than half of the film's footage was modified by Pixar animators to fit within the film's aspect ratio. Several characters and objects were moved closer together to avoid being cut out of frame. The film's VHS release was the best- selling VHS in the United Kingdom, with 1.76 million units sold by the end of the year. On August 1, 2000, these editions were re-released on VHS and DVD under the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection banner. On November 23, 1999, a 2-disc Collector's Edition DVD was released. It was fully remastered in anamorphic widescreen and has substantial bonus features. The edition was re- released on May 27, 2003, to coincide with the release of Finding Nemo. This THX-certified DVD released once again gives the option of viewing the film in Widescreen or Full Frame. The second disc features numerous bonus features, such as a set-top game and a Finding Nemo featurette. On May 19, 2009, the film was released on Blu-ray, and then on 4K Blu-ray on March 3, 2020. ==Reception== ===Box office=== A Bug's Life grossed approximately $33.3 million on its opening weekend, ranking first at the box office, beating out Babe: Pig in the City, The Rugrats Movie, Enemy of the State and The Waterboy. It managed to retain its spot for two weeks until it was taken by Star Trek: Insurrection. The film had also earned $46.5 million during the five-day Thanksgiving holiday weekend, surpassing the previous record holder 101 Dalmatians. In 1999, this record was surpassed by Toy Story 2, which would have the third biggest five-day Wednesday opening, just after Independence Day and Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace. By late December 1998, A Bug's Life had earned over $100 million. Altogether, several in-year 1998 films combined with Titanic pulled $7 billion in North America, propelling the film industry to a record year at the box office. At the end of its theatrical run, the film grossed $162.8 million in the United States and Canada and $200.4 million in foreign countries, pushing its worldwide gross to $363.3 million, surpassing the competition from DreamWorks Animation's Antz, which earned $171.8 million worldwide. ===Critical response=== On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a rating of based on reviews and an average rating of . The site's critical consensus reads, "A Bug's Life is a rousing adventure that blends animated thrills with witty dialogue and memorable characters – and another smashing early success for Pixar." Another review aggregator, Metacritic, gave the film a score of 77 out of 100 based on 23 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, "Lasseter and Pixar broke new technical and aesthetic ground in the animation field with Toy Story, and here they surpass it in both scope and complexity of movement while telling a story that overlaps Antz in numerous ways." James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying "A Bug's Life, like Toy Story, develops protagonists we can root for, and places them in the midst of a fast-moving, energetic adventure." Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, writing "Will A Bug's Life suffer by coming out so soon after Antz? Not any more than one thriller hurts the chances for the next one. Antz may even help business for A Bug's Life by demonstrating how many dramatic and comedic possibilities can be found in an anthill." Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, writing "What A Bug's Life demonstrates is that when it comes to bugs, the most fun ones to hang out with hang exclusively with the gang at Pixar." Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film four out of four stars, stating "A Bug's Life is one of the great movies – a triumph of storytelling and character development, and a whole new ballgame for computer animation. Pixar Animation Studios has raised the genre to an astonishing new level". Richard Corliss of Time magazine wrote, "The plot matures handsomely; the characters neatly converge and combust; the gags pay off with emotional resonance." Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B, saying "A Bug's Life may be the single most amazing film I've ever seen that I couldn't fall in love with." Paul Clinton of CNN wrote, "A Bug's Life is a perfect movie for the holidays. It contains a great upbeat message ... it's wonderful to look at ... it's wildly inventive ... and it's entertaining for both adults and kids." Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune gave the film three and a half stars out of four, and compared the movie to "Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (with a little of another art-film legend, Federico Fellini, tossed in)." where "As in Samurai, the colony here is plagued every year by the arrival of bandits." On the contrary, Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote, "Clever as it is, the film lacks charm. One problem: too many bugs. Second, bigger world for two purposes: to feed birds and to irk humans." ===Accolades=== A Bug's Life won a number of awards and numerous nominations. The film won the inaugural Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Animated Film (tied with The Prince of Egypt) as well as the award for Best Family Film. It also won the Satellite Award for Best Animated Film and the Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition by Randy Newman. It was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score, the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score and the BAFTA Award for Best Achievement in Special Visual Effects. In 2008, the American Film Institute nominated this film for its Top 10 Animation Films list. ===Legacy=== In the years since its release, A Bug's Life has been regarded by critics and fans to be a Pixar film that, in contrast to its successors, has become largely forgotten by audiences. While recognized as solidifying Pixar's success, the film has been seen as the studio's sophomore slump in the wake of the critically successful Toy Story, and inhibited by being released directly before the equally revered Toy Story 2. Pixar's feud with DreamWorks as a result of Antz has also been regarded as a factor in A Bug's Lifes legacy. Critics have generally ranked A Bug's Life to be one of Pixar's weaker releases; while it has been seen as "charming", as well as an "ambitious" film with pioneering animation for its time, others have described it as "adequate", and appealing more to a younger demographic. Nonetheless, the film's characters, voice acting, and humor have received lasting praise. ==Media and merchandise== ===Attached short film=== The film's theatrical and video releases include Geri's Game, an Academy Award winning Pixar short made in 1997, a year before this film was released. ===Video game=== A game, based on the film, was developed by Traveller's Tales and Tiertex Design Studios and released by Sony Computer Entertainment, Disney Interactive, THQ and Activision for various systems. The game's storyline was similar to the film's, with a few changes. However, unlike the film, the game received mixed reviews. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Nintendo 64 version 54.40%, the PlayStation version 51.90% and the Game Boy Color version 36.63%. GameSpot gave the PlayStation version a 2.7/10, concluding that it was "obvious that Disney was more interested in producing a $40 advertisement for its movie than in developing a playable game." IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version a 6.8/10, praising the presentation and sound by stating "It was upbeat, cheery look and feel very much like the movie of the same name with cheery, happy tunes and strong sound effects but again criticized the gameplay by saying the controls were sluggish with stuttering framerate and tired gameplay mechanics". while they gave the PlayStation version a 4/10, criticizing the gameplay as slow and awkward but praising the presentation as cinematic. ==Theme park attractions== Disney's Animal Kingdom includes the 3D show It's Tough to Be a Bug!, which also existed at Disney California Adventure from 2001 to 2018. The Disney California Adventure nighttime show World of Color features a segment that includes Heimlich the Caterpillar from the film. ===Former theme park attractions=== From 2002 to 2018, A Bug's Land was a section of Disney California Adventure that was inspired by the film. ==See also== * Lists of animated feature films * List of Pixar films * List of computer-animated films * List of Disney animated films based on fairy tales * List of films featuring insects ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * Official website at Pixar * * * * Category:1998 films Category:1998 computer-animated films Category:1990s American animated films Category:1998 comedy films Category:American children's animated adventure films Category:American children's animated comedy films Category:Animated films about insects Category:Best Animated Feature Broadcast Film Critics Association Award winners Category:1990s English-language films Category:1990s children's animated films Category:Fictional ants Category:Fictional grasshoppers Category:Films involved in plagiarism controversies Category:Films scored by Randy Newman Category:Films directed by John Lasseter Category:Films produced by Darla K.

18203680	A Bug's Life (soundtrack)	A Bug's Life: An Original Walt Disney Records Soundtrack is the soundtrack to the 1998 Disney/Pixar film A Bug's Life featuring original music composed by Randy Newman and released on October 27, 1998 by Walt Disney Records. Aside the instrumental cues accompanying the album, it also features an original song "The Time of Your Life" written and performed by Newman. The score transitions from orchestral music to 1940s jazz which was used when Flik travels to the city. It was recorded at the Sony Scoring Stage in Culver City, California, Signet Sound Studios in Los Angeles and Conway Recording Studios in Hollywood, California. The score received a Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition Written for a Motion Picture or Television and was also nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score, and Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. == Reception == Alex Henderson of AllMusic rated three out of five stars to the album, summarising: "A Bug's Life isn't an essential purchase by any means, although some of Newman's more hardcore and devoted fans might find it mildly interesting to hear this other side of him." Ian Freer of Empire also rated three stars and called it as "very likeable but ultimately does not grab the attention as well as it might". Filmtracks.com wrote "A Bug's Life could leave non-Randy Newman fans cold. His jazz is predictable and his generic orchestral animation music begs for more personality. The highlights of both Newman's own Pleasantville from the same year and the competing Antz are superior to anything heard here." Rating four-and-a-half stars out of five, James Southall of Movie Wave called the film's score as "the best of Newman's scores for Pixar" as it "lends itself better than the others to album treatment due to its more flowing, less bitty nature". Far Out ranked third in the best of Newman's scores (top 10). Writing for that article, Calum Russell summarised: "Randy Newman’s Bug’s Life score is a joy to listen to, taking the listener immediately back to Pixar’s animated world as it so well recreates the essence of the chaos of the city or the intensity of a bird sighting." Also ranking in their top 10 of the composer's best scores, Dalton Norman of Screen Rant wrote "Newman understood what was expected of him and his score is just as fun and jaunty as his previous Pixar outing. He proved he could work cleverly with scope and scale with his music by shrinking the orchestrations down in scenes that needed simplicity. The film is about a tiny world and the music reflects both the smallness of the world and the overwhelming size of Flik's adventure." == Track listing == == Accolades == Awards Year Association Award Category Recipient (if any) Result 1999 Academy Awards Best Original Musical or Comedy Score Randy Newman rowspan="4" Chicago Film Critics Association Best Original Score Golden Globe Awards Best Original Score Motion Picture Sound Editors Best Sound Editing, Music – Animated Feature Lori L.

2354739	A Bug's Life (video game)	A Bug's Life is a video game based on the Disney/Pixar 1998 film of the same name. It was released for various systems in 1998 and in 1999. The game's storyline is similar to that of the film, with a few changes. After completing levels the player can unlock clips from the film. The PlayStation version was released on the PlayStation Store for the PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable on July 27, 2010. ==Gameplay== A Bug's Life is a platform game in which the player controls Flik throughout settings and a storyline based on the namesake film. The game is divided into five distinct "lands" consisting of three levels each.A Bug's Life (Nintendo 64) instruction booklet, pp. 23–24 To complete a level, the player must either find an exit, complete a goal or defeat a boss character.A Bug's Life (Nintendo 64) instruction booklet, p. 19 Flik's primary form of offense against enemy characters is throwing berries. By default, Flik throws red-colored berries, which are the weakest form of berry and cannot harm certain enemies. Stronger berries can either be found within a level or received from planting purple-colored seeds. Collecting purple seed tokens increases the range of berries a seed can produce. Aside from increased power, some berries travel faster and can home in on enemies. The strongest form of berry is gold-colored and is capable of permanently eliminating enemies and preventing them from respawning.A Bug's Life (Nintendo 64) instruction booklet, pp. 14–15 Several seeds are scattered throughout the levels. Flik can hoist most seeds over his head and carry them to other areas, although some seeds are embedded into the ground and cannot be moved. Jumping on top of a seed creates a plant that aids Flik in some fashion. By default, all seeds are colored brown and bear plants that help Flik traverse high terrain. The color of the seeds and the type of plant they bear can be changed if Flik collects differently-colored seed tokens within a level. Some plants can restore Flik's health, provide a shield from enemy attacks, propel him through the air, or damage enemies by firing berries. Plants can be uprooted and discarded, which results in a fresh seed appearing in its place.A Bug's Life (Nintendo 64) instruction booklet, pp. 11–13 Flik's health is displayed as a leaf on the top-right corner of the screen, and the player is given six lives at the beginning of the game. When Flik's health is full, the leaf appears whole, but if he is harmed by an enemy or hazard, a bite is taken out of the leaf. Health can be restored by collecting leaves marked with a red cross, which are released from defeated enemies and blue seed plants. Collecting 50 pieces of grain within a level will restore Flik's health completely. If the leaf is completely eaten away, a life is lost. An extra life can be received if the letters F, L, I and K are collected within a level. If all of Flik's lives are lost, it is game over.A Bug's Life (Nintendo 64) instruction booklet, p. 18 Floating telescopes grant a rotating view of either hidden items in a level or the level's exit and the surrounding details. Flik's grain harvester is present in certain levels, and can be used to attract distant grain and permanently kill most enemies while it is worn. ==Development== The game was announced in October 1997. ==Reception== The console versions of A Bug's Life was met with "mixed or average" reviews while the Game Boy Color version was met with "generally unfavorable" reviews. Aggregating review website GameRankings gave the Nintendo 64 version 54.40%, the PlayStation version 55.73% and the Game Boy Color version 36.63%. GameSpot gave the PlayStation version 2.7 out of 10, concluding that it was "obvious that Disney was more interested in producing a $40 advertisement for its movie than in developing a playable game". However, the same site later gave the Nintendo 64 version a score of 6.1 out of 10, stating that "children looking to relive the fun of the movie should be pleased with the simplicity of the game". IGN gave the Nintendo 64 version 6.8 out of 10, praising the presentation and sound by stating that it had an "upbeat, cheery look and feel very much like the movie of the same name" with "cheery, happy tunes and strong sound effects" but criticised the gameplay by saying the controls were sluggish with "stuttering framerate" and "tired gameplay mechanics" while they gave the PlayStation version 4 out of 10, criticizing the gameplay as slow and awkward but praising the presentation as cinematic. The same site later gave the Game Boy Color version a score of three out of ten, calling it "short and repetitive" and "below average". Daniel Erickson reviewed the Nintendo 64 version of the game for Next Generation, rating it one star out of five, and stated that "any way you slice it, this stinks". === Awards === The game won the Computer Children's Entertainment Title of the Year award at the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, competing against six other nominees. ==References== ==External links== * * A Bug’s Life (PlayStation) can be played for free in the browser on the Internet Archive Category:1998 video games Category:3D platform games Video game Category:Activision games Category:D.I.C.E.

Ed knocks out Frank, unlocks the cuffs and flees, coming upon a woman called Cally tending to sheep, seemingly by herself in a remote cabin. Frank follows and identifies himself as a Utah lawman who after tracking Ed for nearly two years finally caught up with him. Cally is hesitant to trust either stranger. She is an educated woman whose father, a former Oxford University professor, is living with her but is currently away. As a torrential rain falls, Ed attempts to escape, but the passage is flooded. Cally tries to warn him, but pulls a knife when Ed tries to rape her. At the cabin, Frank has no weapon and searches for a rifle Cally has hidden. Ed returns and, while trapped there during the storm, explains to Cally that he shot Frank's brother in self-defense, whereupon Frank had himself deputized but intends to kill him rather than bring him to justice. Cally's father returns and is startled to find two men there. He hears their stories and, aware that his daughter is falling in love with Ed, offers him a chance to turn himself in to other authorities. With a gun in his hand and a single bullet in the chamber, Ed proves his intent by refusing to shoot Frank when he has the chance. He sets off to surrender himself to the actual police. ==Cast== * Jean Simmons as Cally Canham * Rory Calhoun as Ed Stone * Stephen McNally as Frank Munson * Brian Aherne as David Canham ==Production== The film was to be the first in three movies starring Jean Simmons produced by Howard Welsch.

25751847	A Bullet for Joey	A Bullet for Joey is a 1955 film noir directed by Lewis Allen and starring Edward G. Robinson and George Raft. The picture involves a gangster who sneaks into Canada to kidnap a scientist for the communists. The supporting cast features Audrey Totter, Peter van Eyck, George Dolenz, and Peter Hansen. ==Plot== Communist agents in Canada are spying on Dr. Carl Macklin, an atomic physicist whose knowledge they want. To kidnap him, Eric Hartman, the party's top man in Montreal, offers $100,000 to a deported American criminal, Joe Victor. Joe's former flame, Joyce Geary, is blackmailed into helping with the plan. Police Inspector Leduc of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigates and ends up caring for Joyce, as she does for him. A thug working for Victor kills the scientist's secretary after using her to gain information. Leduc is taken prisoner aboard a ship as Hartman and Victor attempt to take Dr. Macklin with them to Europe. A plea is made by Leduc to the gangster Victor, who misses his native America, to do the right thing for a change and help stop the Communists. A shootout ensues between Victor and Hartman, who end up killing one another, but Joyce's innocence is proven to the satisfaction of Leduc and the law. ==Cast== * Edward G. Robinson as Inspector Leduc * George Raft as Joe Victor * Audrey Totter as Joyce * Peter van Eyck as Hartman * George Dolenz as Macklin * Peter Hansen as Fred ==Production== The film was originally entitled Canada's Great Manhunt. It was inspired by a magazine article by Stephen Brott. This was turned into a story by James Benson Nablo which was optioned by Sam Bischoff, who had owned a production company with George Raft in the late 1940s, and David Diamond. Geoffrey Homes wrote the script and George Raft and Edward G Robinson were signed to play the leads. Gloria Grahame was sought to play the female lead. Robinson and Raft had starred in a previous film together 14 years earlier, Raoul Walsh's Manpower with Marlene Dietrich. Filming started 10 December 1954. Robinson was greylisted at the time. He paid Bezzerides $5,000 to polish Robinson's dialogue. When Raft found out about this, Raft paid the writer to perform the same function for him.Aaker p 164 ==Release== A Bullet for Joey was released in theatres in New York City on April 15, 1955. The film was released in London at the Exhibitors' Trade Show on April 7, 1955, and in Australia on March 16, 1956. A Bullet for Joey was released on Blu-ray in November 2015, and DVD by Kino Lorber Studio Classics on July 10, 2007, and November 17, 2015. ==Reception== ===Critical response=== The Los Angeles Times called the film "moderately exciting". In his book, Film Noir, Detective and Mystery Movies on DVD, John Howard Reid considered the movie dull. Slow pace, one- dimensional characters, and an unconvincing climax plague the film. Film critic Bosley Crowther wrote in his review: "AGE cannot wither nor custom stale the infinite uniformity of Edward G. Robinson and George Raft. In A Bullet for Joey, a crime drama that came to the Palace yesterday, along with the vaudeville program, Mr. Raft solemnly appears as an outcast American gangster called back into service to do a job of kidnapping a key atomic scientist out of Canada for a "foreign power." And Mr. Robinson plays a cool inspector of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police who is assigned to uncover the suspected connivance and nip it in the bud. Considerately, we need not scan the details of Mr. Raft's laying out the job and Mr. Robinson's patient checking on him every step of the way. These are things that Mr. Raft and Mr. Robinson can act with their eyes shut—and sometimes do. (We suspect, in this instance, that the director, Lewis Allen, had his eyes shut, too.)" ===Box office=== The film was a box office flop. ==See also== *List of American films of 1955 ==References== ===Sources=== * * * * ==External links== * * * *Review of film at Cinema Retro *Review of film at Variety Category:1955 films Category:1950s English-language films Category:American crime drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Cold War spy films Category:American anti-communist propaganda films Category:Film noir Category:United Artists films Category:Films directed by Lewis Allen Category:Films scored by Harry Sukman Category:Films set in Montreal Category:Films shot in California Category:1955 crime drama films Category:1950s thriller films Category:1950s American films
35366417	A Bullet for Pretty Boy	A Bullet for Pretty Boy is a 1970 American action film from director Larry Buchanan. It stars Fabian Forte as gangster Pretty Boy Floyd and co-stars Jocelyn Lane in her final performance before retiring from acting in 1971.A Bullet for Pretty Boy at Fabianforte.net ==Plot== Oklahoma farmer Charles Floyd marries Ruby. At the reception, some goons insult Ruby and Charles attacks them. This results in Floyd's father and one of the goons being killed. Floyd is convicted of the crime and sent to work on the chain gang. Several years later Floyd escapes from prison and takes refuge in a brothel run by Beryl, where prostitute Betty falls for him. Beryl's brother Wallace wants Betty for himself and starts to hate Floyd, giving him the nickname "Pretty Boy". The brothel is a hangout for Ned Short and his gang of bank robbers. Floyd joins them and becomes a full-fledged criminal. Floyd returns to Oklahoma to see his wife. They still love each other but she can't be with him because he is now a bank robber. He then goes on a crime spree with another member of the gang, an old friend called Preacher. Pretty Boy Floyd is eventually killed. ==Cast== ==Production== Fabian was signed to make the film in June 1969. Filming took place entirely on location in Texas and was completed by October.MOVIE CALL SHEET: Gangster Role for Fabian Martin, Betty. Los Angeles Times 16 June 1969: c17. The movie had the largest budget ever given to Buchanan. Buchanan later said his "cue" on the film was Woody Guthrie's 'The Ballad of Pretty Boy Floyd,' which examines the populist folk- hero angle of the outlaw. In particular, he was inspired by Woody's great line about how 'some men will rob you with a six-gun, and some will rob you with a fountain pen'." The film features Morgan Fairchild in a small role as a gangster's moll. Buchanan later said "I gave her her first job" on the film. According to one account, halfway through the film AIP executives were worried about the movie being behind schedule and replaced Buchanan with Maury Dexter.Mark McGee, Faster and Furiouser: The Revised and Fattened Fable of American International Pictures, McFarland, 1996 p241 According to Dexter's own memoirs, he went on the film as executive producer at the behest of James H. Nicholson of AIP "to make sure Larry brought the film in on schedule and with some amount of quality." Dexter says that "the film went along without a hitch and Larry delivered a nice film" but that after it was put together to a rough cut Dexter and AIP "thought it was too slow and talky." He then took a small crew and returned to Dallas with stunt doubles and the actors "and shot several scenes involving action. We cut the new material in and we thought it helped the film overall."Maury Dexter, Highway to Hollywood p 134 accessed 5 July 2014 ===Songs=== The group The Source sing the following songs: *"Bullet for a Pretty Boy" *"It's Me I'm Running From" *"I'm Gonna Love You ('Til I Die)" *"Gone Tomorrow" *"Ruby Ruby" ==Reception== The New York Times accused Buchanan of making "a murderous gangster movie full of mostly nice guys" which "looks a little as if they had taken the members of the cast of, say, Beach Blanket Bingo and put them in costume and given them old cars to drive and told them to play it for real." The Los Angeles Times thought the film was "surprisingly free from gratuitous gore" but was still "another very pale carbon of Bonnie and Clyde" in which Fabian "handles himself in competent fashion amidst a host of amateurs." Diabolique magazine later said: > Fabian gives another accomplished performance as a gee-it-isn’t-his-fault- > kid-forced-to-crime. His physical attractiveness is exploited heavily in the > movie – surprisingly few films did this considering Fabian became a pop star > mostly by being good looking. Here he’s got Jocelyn Lane and Astrid Warner > throwing themselves at him, as well as a brothel madam. The film itself is > competent rather than inspired – it could have done with more passion – but > isn’t bad. ==See also== * List of American films of 1970 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1970 films Category:1970s biographical films Category:1970 crime films Category:American biographical films Category:American crime action films Category:American International Pictures films Category:Biographical films about Depression-era gangsters Category:1970s English-language films Category:American gangster films Category:Cultural depictions of Pretty Boy Floyd Category:Films directed by Larry Buchanan Category:1970s American films

34463023	A Bullet for Sandoval	A Bullet for Sandoval (a.k.a. Those Desperate Men Who Smell of Dirt and Death, a.k.a. Desperate Men) is a 1969 Spaghetti Western film. It is a co-production between Italy (where is known as Quei disperati che puzzano di sudore e di morte) and Spain (where it was released as Los Desperados). The film was generally well received by critics. For years, it was thought that famed Italian horror film director Lucio Fulci directed this western, but that was later disputed by the film's lead star George Hilton.Howarth,Troy (2015). "Splintered Visions: Lucio Fulci and his Films". Midnight Marquee Press. Page 55 ==Plot== John Warner is a soldier for the Confederate States of America. When he receives a message that his lover is about to deliver a child he becomes a deserter. On his way to her he is captured and brought before a tribunal. Yet two old friends make sure he can escape. He makes it to the town where he expects his lover to be. Only is he too late too marry her because she's died in the meantime. He tries to take care of his child as a single father but the citizens of this town aren't supportive and thus another tragedy takes place. The love of army deserter John Warner dies at deliverance and their baby child perishes after its grandfather, the landowner Sandoval, rejects it. Warner forms a feared outlaw gang with of two fellow deserters, one runaway lay brother, and some outlaws that join along the way. The local ranchers call in the army for protection, but except for an episode where Warner refuses to make a woman a hostage for money, we mainly see the gang harass Sandoval. One of the gang eventually tries to sell out Warner for a reward. The four core members stay together until Warner has avenged himself on Sandoval, and then they die a spectacular death at a shootout in a bullfighting arena. == Cast == * George Hilton as Corporal John Warner * Ernest Borgnine as Don Pedro Sandoval * Alberto De Mendoza as Lucky Boy * Leo Anchóriz as Padre Converso * Annabella Incontrera as Rosa Sandoval * Antonio Pica as Sam Paul * Manuel Miranda as Francisco Sandoval * Gustavo Rojo as Guadalupano * Andrea Aureli as Morton * Manuel De Blas as José Sandoval ==Reception== In his discussion of the cases of double motives in Spaghetti Western films Fridlund contrasts stories like A Bullet for Sandoval - where the revenge motive of Warner comes into conflict with the monetary motive of some gang members - with the bounty killer pair in For a Few Dollars More, where at first their common monetary motive creates a conflict which is resolved when the revenge motive of the Mortimer character is revealed and he leaves the collection of all the bounty to the Man with No Name character.Fridlund, Bert: The Spaghetti Western.

4241755	A Bullet for the General	A Bullet for the General (; original title means "Who knows?", in the Spanish language), also known as El Chucho Quién Sabe?, is a 1966 Italian Zapata Western film directed by Damiano Damiani and starring Gian Maria Volonté, Lou Castel, Klaus Kinski and Martine Beswick. The film, a Zapata Western, tells the story of El Chuncho, a bandit, and Bill Tate (or El Niño/The Kid), a counter-revolutionary contract killer in Mexico. Chuncho soon learns that social revolution is more important than mere money. ==Plot== During the Mexican Revolution, a Durango-bound government munitions train is forced to stop due to the presence of a crucified federal army officer on the tracks. El Chuncho Muños, a gun runner loyal to the revolutionary leader General Elías, leads his gang in an assault on the train. Lieutenant Alvaro Ferreira commanding the rurales of the escort attempts to save the officer, but upon being fatally wounded by Chuncho, he is forced to order the train to run the captain over and escape the bandits. Bill Tate, an American passenger on the train, kills the engineer and stops the train again, allowing Chuncho and his gang to kill the remaining rurales and take their weapons. Posing as a former prisoner of the army, Tate joins the gang, and is quickly befriended by Chuncho, who nicknames him "Niño". After several heists, the gang travels to the town of San Miguel, where Chuncho meets with his old friend Raimundo to overthrow the weakhearted town boss, Don Felipe. Rosaria, Felipe's spirited wife, attempts to defend him; when Chuncho's men assault her, Tate angrily berates them for their behaviour. Chuncho shoots Guapo, a gang member, for attempting to kill Tate. Don Felipe is made to drive Chuncho and his gang back to San Miguel, and he is eventually executed. Chuncho prepares to stay in San Miguel, drilling the villagers in the hopes of becoming a General himself; Tate convinces much of the gang to leave San Miguel so they can sell their weapons to Elías. Eventually missing his bandit lifestyle, Chuncho leaves San Miguel under the care of El Santo, his priestly half-brother, on the pretext of recovering a gold-plated Hotchkiss M1914 machine gun from his former gang. After killing one of them, Picaro, Chuncho resumes leadership of the others, hoping to sell the weapons to Elías before returning to San Miguel. Elías' emissary arrives, but is pursued by army troops. Tate and Chuncho use the machine gun to decimate the troops, but nearly all of Chuncho's remaining gang is killed in the firefight. Unseen by the others, Tate also kills the emissary. Adelita, Chuncho's last surviving loyal gang member, abandons the pair after her lover, Pepito, is killed in the battle. During the ride to Elías' camp, Tate falls victim to a malaria attack. While getting quinine pills for Tate, Chuncho finds a golden bullet among his possessions; Tate later claims that the bullet is a good luck charm. Chuncho and Tate arrive at Elías' camp the next morning, where they encounter several starving revolutionaries. Chuncho sells the guns and is paid five thousand pesos, before learning from Elías that the people of San Miguel were massacred by the army. Realising his irresponsibility, Chuncho allows himself to be taken away to be executed by Santo, one of the sole survivors of the attack. Meanwhile, Tate, from a high vantage point, shoots Elías and kills Santo before Chuncho's sentence can be carried out. Tate escapes as Elías' doctors pronounce his death: shot in the head with a golden bullet. Weeks later, Chuncho, now an impoverished beggar, tracks Tate to a hotel in Ciudad Juarez and tries to shoot him. Tate, insisting that he has been waiting for him, gives him a half- share of the reward he received from the Mexican Government for assassinating Elías: 100,000 pesos in gold. Chuncho, astonished by Tate's apparent loyalty and friendship, visits a barber, a tailor and a brothel. The next morning the pair prepare to leave for a new life in the United States. However, when Chuncho watches as Tate cuts through a line to buy their train tickets, he begins to reconsider their relationship and his responsibilities. Learning that he had been further manipulated by Tate through his pretending to be an army prisoner, Chuncho suddenly declares that, although they are friends, he must kill him. Tate asks why, to which Chuncho replies "¿Quién sabe?" before shooting him."¿Quién sabe?" means "Who knows?" in Spanish. In the American version, this line is translated as "I don't know." Tate's body begins its return to the United States, while Chuncho, laughing manically, tosses his bag of money to a group of peasants and flees from the authorities down an external corridor of carriages, exhorting the poor to buy dynamite instead of bread. ==Cast== * Gian Maria Volonté as El Chuncho Muños/Niños * Klaus Kinski as El Santo * Martine Beswick as Adelita * Lou Castel as Bill "Niño" Tate/Taylor ** William Berger as Bill "Niño" Tate * Jaime Fernández as General Elías * Andrea Checchi as Don Felipe * Spartaco Conversi as Eufemio * Joaquín Parra as Picaro * Aldo Sambrell as Lieutenant Alvaro Ferreira * José Manuel Martín as Raimundo * Santiago Santos as Guapo * Valentino Macchi as Train Engineer * Guy Heron as Pepito * Carla Gravina as Rosaria * Rufino Inglés as Captain Enrique Sanchez Compoy * Vicente Roca as Hotelier * Antoñito Ruiz as Chico * Sal Borgese as Bandit * Damiano Damiani as Journalist with Elías * Aysanoa Runachagua as Paymaster * Richard McNamara as Opening Narrator ==Production== The screenplay and story for A Bullet for the General is credited to Salvatore Laurani while Franco Solinas is credited with the adaptation and dialogue. Film historian Howard Hughes noted that A Bullet for the General was the first Italian Western to seriously deal with the Mexican revolution and credited Solinas with the political aspects on the film. Solinas was a Marxist writer best known in film for his screenplays for Salvatore Giuliano and The Battle of Algiers. A Bullet for the General was directed by Damiano Damiani and shot in Almería between July and August 1966. Damiani had originally wanted to shoot the film in Mexico which proved to be impossible. ==Release== A Bullet for the General was released in Italy in December 1966. ==Reception== In a contemporary review, the Monthly Film Bulletin declared the film to be "a lively sortie into the Mexican Revolution with a good deal of boisterous action and a spirited performance from Gian Maria Volonte". The review noted the running time cut from 135 minutes to 77 minutes, stating "substantial pruning unfortunately plays havoc with the continuity (a character who was clearly of some importance in the original is here reduced to a few marginal references)." Damiano's film has been called a "serious statement about the Mexican Revolution" and has been recognised as an accomplished blend of "tension, action, politics and history". == References == ===Footnotes=== ===Notes=== ===Sources=== * * * ==External links== * Category:1966 films Category:1960s Italian-language films Category:Spaghetti Western films Category:Films directed by Damiano Damiani Category:1966 Western (genre) films Category:Mexican Revolution films Category:Films scored by Luis Bacalov Category:Films shot in Almería Category:1960s Italian films

He goes to the United Kingdom with his career deteriorating and having problems with his daughter who is an aspiring actress on the fringes of the New York theatre. The local villagers are somewhat of a motley crew and are naturally delighted to have such an - albeit unsuccessful - star playing with them. Reynolds plays a typically selfish American with no time for manners, and displays an appalling lack of class, considering himself too big for this lowly setting. The transition to humble actor, happy to play with the British actors takes some time, but eventually he is reconciled with his estranged daughter and realises that he is no better, in terms of talent and intelligence, than his amateur colleagues. ==Cast== * Burt Reynolds as Jefferson Steele * Samantha Bond as Dorothy Nettle * Imelda Staunton as Mary * Derek Jacobi as Nigel Dewberry * Camilla Arfwedson as Amanda Blacke * Charles Durning as Charlie Rosenberg * Lorraine Ashbourne as Janine Jarvis * Gemma Lawrence as Verity Nettle * Peter Gunn as Frank Dobbins * Tony Jayawardena as Kevin Patel * Alistair Petrie as Rupert Twisk * Peter Wight as Mike Bell * Kelly Price as Lauren Bell * Surendra Kochar as Kevin's Mum * Kirsty More as School Girl == Release == The film had its UK premiere at the Royal Film Performance, an event held in aid of the Film & TV Charity, on November 17, 2008 at the ODEON Leicester Square.

It is subtitled Undertakers to the Industry – If They're Dead - We'll Sign 'Em. One of the tracks, Elvis Costello's "Less Than Zero", had been issued as single only a week prior to this album being released, although this is an unusual and otherwise-unavailable mix of the song, which has keyboards overdubbed over the intro. Motörhead's "White Line Fever" had been scheduled for release in December 1976, but the issue was cancelled. Wreckless Eric's "(I'd Go The) Whole Wide World" was issued as a single in August 1977. The album did not enter the UK charts. Graham Parker's track (No. 6, the final track on side 1 of the LP) was not listed on the original release, probably due to his contract with Phonogram, for whose Vertigo label he and the Rumour had already released two LPs.

60836787	A Bundle of Asparagus	thumb|300px|A Bundle of Asparagus (1880) by Édouard Manet A Bundle of Asparagus or A Bunch of Asparagus (Une botte d'asperges, La botte d'asperges or Botte d'asperges) is an 1880 painting by Édouard Manet. It was commissioned by the art collector Charles Ephrussi for 800 francs. On receiving the work he gave the artist 1,000 francs instead and so Manet decided to paint a smaller second work, now known as A Sprig of Asparagus. He sent this second work to Ephrussi with a note reading, "There was one [sprig] missing in your bundle".Françoise Cachin, Charles S. Moffett and Juliet Wilson-Bareau, Manet 1832-1883 : Galeries nationales du Grand Palais, Paris, 22 April-1 August 1983, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 10 September - 27 November 1983, New York, The Metropolitan museum of art, 1983, 544 p. (), p. 451 (catalogue no 188) == Image description == Manet's Bunch of Asparagus shows a motif based on traditional still life painting. In the center of the picture lies a bunch of white asparagus stalks in the bright light. The view goes from the side to the bunch of asparagus, whose violet tips are aligned to the right edge of the picture. It is held together by two thin willow rods that were used to transport the vegetables.Gert von der Osten: Manet, S. 7. The bunch of asparagus lies on a base of green leaves that reach from the left side to the lower right corner of the picture. Manet's biographer Théodore Duret speaks of a "lit d'herbes vertes" (bed of green leaves).Théodore Duret: Histoire d’Édouard Manet et de son oeuvre, S. 261. For the art historian Mikael Wivel, Manet presented the asparagus in the same way a greengrocer would display his goods.„The bunch lies there just as the greengrocer would have displayed it on his counter“ in Mikael Wivel: Manet, S. 140. A bluish-white background can be seen at the bottom left and in the middle of the right edge of the picture, which could be a tableclothGotthard Jedlicka spricht von einem „weißen, bläulich durchschimmerten Wachstuch“ und von einem „Tischtuch“ in Gotthard Jedlicka: Manet, S. 199. Danach bezeichnet er den Untergrund als „Tischdecke“ oder generell als „Küchentisch“ in Gotthard Jedlicka: Manet, S. 200. or a light marble slab.Juliet Wilson-Bareau hat auf eine „Marmorfläche, die immer wieder in seinen späten Stilleben auftaucht“ hingewiesen, siehe Juliet Wilson- Bareau: Manet: Auf Anhieb malen, was man sieht in Brigitte Buberl: Cézanne, Manet, Schuch; drei Wege zur autonomen Kunst, S. 122. Solch ein Tisch ist beispielsweise in den Gemälden Rosen und Tulpen in einer Vase, Rosen in einer Glasvase und Der Fliederstrauß zu sehen. Von Manets Besucher George Moore ist überliefert, dass „a marble table on iron supports, such as one sees in cafe’s“ (ein Marmortisch mit Eisenfüßen, in der Art, wie man ihn in Caféhäusern sehen kann) in seinem Atelier stand, siehe George Moore: Modern painting, S. 31. The signature 'Manet' can be found on the lower left of this light background. The upper half of the picture is occupied by a black-brown background in which "the colors are velvety intertwined", as the author Gotthard Jedlicka states.Gotthard Jedlicka: Manet, S. 200. In this composition, the green leaves and purple asparagus tips have the difficult task of contrastingly separating the asparagus spears from the background, both of which are executed in a similar color scheme.Manuela B. Mena Marqués hat in Bezug auf das Gemälde mit der einzelnen Spargelstange darauf hingewiesen, wie schwierig es sei, den Spargel zu malen, wenn der Untergrund die gleiche Farbgebung hat: „Asparagus is perhaps the most difficult of all the studies he produced during those months; the yellowish white vegetable lies on a table of the same colour“. Englischsprachiger Katalogtext aus Manuela B. Mena Marqués: Manet en el Prado, S. 485. Gotthard Jedlicka sees a connection to the colors of the background in the dark willow branches. For him, there is also a first impression in which the asparagus spears appear yellow and the tips appear purple. On closer inspection, however, they are "painted with an indescribable richness of color tones." Jedlicka sees other color nuances in the yellow of the asparagus spears, such as blue, white, rosy and violet tones, and in the tips he recognizes red, blue, green, yellow and other colors, with each tip being painted individually. For Jedlicka, Manet's brushwork ranges from "broad and impasto application to the finest drawing in lines and dots". The museum director Gert von der Osten emphasizes that Manet's still life was "painted quite openly impressionist with ingenious accuracy". Manet's style of painting in this picture was examined in detail by employees of the Wallraf-Richartz-Museum & Fondation Corboud in Cologne in 2008 on the occasion of the exhibition Impressionism: How the light came to the canvas. When viewing the work in transmitted light, in which the painting is illuminated from behind, it could be proven that Manet applied the brown color of the background thinly to the gray primed canvas in an “old masterly” manner. He worked with a flat brush and left out the area of the asparagus spears. When looking at the painting with the help of a microscope, the painting style in the area of the asparagus was also analyzed. Here Manet worked with a narrow brush and placed the lines next to each other and crossed them. In contrast to traditional painting, he did not carefully mix the colors on the palette, but only directly on the canvas. The impression of the fleeting style of painting is further reinforced by the sometimes impasto application of the paint. The "colors painted wet on wet" indicate that Manet probably created the painting in "a single working session".Iris Schäfer, Caroline von Saint-George, Katja Lewerentz: Impressionismus: Wie das Licht auf die Leinwand kam, S. 127. ==See also== * List of paintings by Édouard Manet ==References== Category:Still life paintings Category:1880 paintings Category:Paintings by Édouard Manet Category:Collections of the Wallraf–Richartz Museum Category:Asparagus
3914788	A Bundle of Letters	"A Bundle of Letters" is a comic short story by Henry James, originally published in The Parisian magazine in 1879, which is also when the story takes place. The story is one of James' few ventures into epistolary fiction. As he did so often, especially in the early stages of his career, James made the tale part of his international theme: his letter-writers represent a number of different countries. Although some of the characters look like well-worn stereotypes -- the wolfish Frenchman, the pedantic and aggressively nationalistic German, the snobbish upper-class English siblings -- James manages to endow most of them with enough twists and turns of personality to interest the reader. One character has even been taken as a sly satire on himself. ==Plot summary== Several residents of a Paris boarding-house write letters to their friends and family back home; their primary subject is their reaction to each other. The main character is Miranda Hope, an angular but likeable Yankee Miss from Bangor, Maine who, quite bravely for a young woman of that era, is traveling in Europe alone. In her letters, she chatters to her mother about seeing the sights in Europe but doesn't like the Old World's treatment of its women, "and that is a point, you know, on which I feel very strongly." Her expressions of petulance with William Platt, who we realize must have been a suitor of hers back in Maine, are so offhand as to be amusing. Although she is in general the least affected and most sympathetic character in the story, her unawareness of the disdain in which most of the characters hold each other (including herself) makes her seem somewhat naive. Meanwhile, society girl Violet Ray of New York writes to a friend that Miranda, who she sees as provincial, is "really too horrible." Another boarder, wannabe aesthete Louis Leverett (quite possibly a self-satire by James) gushes in his letter that "the great thing is to live, you know," amid much precious verbiage about the good, the true and the bee-a-u-tiful. An English boarder, Evelyn Vane, pens a scoffing note that Louis is always talking about the color of the sky, but she doubts if he's ever seen it except through a window-pane; and the German sees Leverett's "decadence" as further evidence that the English-speaking world is weak and ripe for takeover. The Frenchman Leon Verdier almost drools in his letter about the charms of ces demoiselles among the boarders, and focuses primarily on their appearance. The rather threatening German professor is the only character both cynical and intelligent enough to realize how disdainful all the English speakers are of each other. However, he's also the least sympathetic character in the story. (James disliked Germany and its culture.) While the other characters despise each other mostly on personal grounds, or from cultural misunderstanding, Herr Professor despises them all based on their national traits and general sub- human status (he calls the Frenchman "simian"). In a letter to his German friend, he simultaneously brags of his erudition and predicts that the weakness of these other nationalities augurs a bright future "for the deep- lunged children of the Fatherland!" ==Major themes== In his New York Edition preface James says that he wrote this relaxed, very funny story in a single sitting: "an unusual straightness of labour." Not much about the story seems labored, though, as James brought a great deal of the wit and sparkle of his own letters to those of his imagined correspondents. The story makes mostly light work of national differences, but the penultimate letter from Dr. Staub, the Deutschland-über-alles fanatic, sounds a jarring note of reality. James gives a final letter from Miranda to soften the harshness of Staub's rants-- and the similar harshness of James' attitude towards Germany. But readers today can't help but remember how Staub's words would find terrible fulfillment in the bloody first half of the 20th century. Finally, much of the humor in the piece comes from the characters' undercutting of each other's lies and pretensions, while none of them are aware that the others are writing about them. Only the reader really sees what's going on, which adds to the entertainment value of the piece. ==Critical evaluation== This story was pirated in an unauthorized version before James could get the legitimate book through the press, which proves how popular and salable it was. The humor is immediate and vivid, and few critics have resisted the charm of James' sharply drawn characters. This was perhaps the best way James could approach writing for the drama, a long-cherished dream of his. He could forget about stage business and just let his characters reveal themselves in letters. Much critical talk has centered on the ranting German, Dr. Staub. Writing from a wartime point of view in 1945, Clifton Fadiman avowed that Staub showed how barbaric the German nation was. After four decades had allowed passions to cool, Edward Wagenknecht demurred that James' portrait of the doctrinaire pedant was jingoistic and unfair. Whatever the reader may make of these opinions, there's no question that Staub's letter is much different from the others and far more disturbing in its implications. ==References== * The Tales of Henry James by Edward Wagenknecht (New York: Frederick Ungar Publishing Co. 1984) * A Henry James Encyclopedia by Robert L.

23027143	A Burial at Ornans	A Burial at Ornans (, also known as A Funeral at Ornans) is a painting of 1849–50 by Gustave Courbet. It is widely regarded as a major turning point in 19th-century French art. The painting records a funeral in Courbet's birthplace, the small town of Ornans. It treats an ordinary, provincial funeral with frank realism, and on the grand scale traditionally reserved for the heroic or religious scenes of history painting. Its exhibition at the 1850–51 Paris Salon created an "explosive reaction" and brought Courbet instant fame.Mack, Gerstle (1989). Gustave Courbet. Da Capo. p. 88-93. . It is currently displayed at the Musée d'Orsay in Paris, France == Background == === Creation === thumb|Courbet was possibly influenced by The Meagre Company after a trip to Amsterdam thumb|Original sketch of A Burial at Ornans by Courbet from 1849 Courbet likely drew inspiration from two different types of sources. One is seventeenth-century Dutch group portraits, such as Banquet of Captain Bicker (1648), Company of Captain Allaert Cloek (1632), or Meagre Company (1637).Fried, Michael. “The Structure of Beholding in Courbet’s ‘Burial at Ornans.’” Critical Inquiry 9, no. 4 (June 1983): 635–83. The other is woodcuts from the 1830s and 40s such as Souvenir Mortuaire (1830), featuring an elevated cross and a grave digger the left, and Degrés des Âges (1830), depicting individuals in a semicircle around a scene of death. While these all likely had an impact on the creation of the painting, Courbet scholar Gerstle Mack claims that the original inspiration for the painting most likely came from the funeral of Oudot, Courbet's grandfather, who had died a year before he created the painting. According to another theory, the painting is based on a funeral for a member of the Proudhon family; Courbet was close with Pierre- Joseph Proudhon, and some of the figures in Burial are said to resemble members of the family.McCarthy, James C. “Courbet’s Ideological Contradictions and the Burial at Ornans.” Art Journal 35, no. 1 (Autumn 1975): 13. Courbet made a sketch prior to the final work, and the people of Ornans posed as models. === Composition === At the bottom center of the painting, there is an open grave with a skull and bones along its edge. Behind the grave stands a group of attendees, arranged loosely in three groups: church members, veterans with a dog, and other officials and mourners. The members of the church include a priest, a cross bearer, choir boys, and beadles.McCarthy, James C. “Courbet’s Ideological Contradictions and the Burial at Ornans.” Art Journal 35, no. 1 (Autumn 1975): 12. The crucifix held by the cross bearer looms above the figures in the painting. Courbet described the two figures standing with the white dog as "two old veterans of the Revolution of '93" who wear "the clothes of their time."McCarthy, James C. “Courbet’s Ideological Contradictions and the Burial at Ornans.” Art Journal 35, no. 1 (Autumn 1975): 13. The two figures have since been identified as Secrétan and Cardet, both friends of Courbet's grandfather. The figure among the crowd in the back on the far left of the painting has also been identified as Oudot, Courbet's grandfather.McCarthy, James C. “Courbet’s Ideological Contradictions and the Burial at Ornans.” Art Journal 35, no. 1 (Autumn 1975): 12–16. The painting places the figures in a linear structure, arranging them alongside of each other. For this reason, some have described it as an additive mode of composition that focuses on the juxtaposition of figures. Others push back on this notion, claiming that the proximity of the figures along with their similar colors of costume unify them as though they are physically merged, not allowing the viewers attention to rest on one person at a time. Each figure also appears to receive relatively equal emphasis, making the composition of the painting anti-hierarchical. Additionally, the linear nature of the painting suggests a lateral movement, which is reinforced by the final painting and the original sketch having unusual proportions, being much wider than tall.Fried, Michael. “The Structure of Beholding in Courbet’s ‘Burial at Ornans.’” Critical Inquiry 9, no. 4 (June 1983): 635–83. == Analysis == === Interpretations === By 1848, Courbet showed an interest in representing common people in a realistic manner. He expressed in letters his belief that his art was democratic. By depicting the townspeople of Ornans at a grand scale that was previously reserved for history paintings, Courbet declared the importance of ordinary, rural people to the Parisian public at the Salon. The provocative presentation of an ordinary subject in a large format has led many commentators to see the work as a political statement. This interpretation was especially common among Courbet's contemporaries who praised it for its realism, as well as for the democratic and socialist ideals it represented.Kselman, Thomas A. “Courbet’s Burial At Ornans And The Cult Of The Dead.” In Death and Afterlife in Modern France, 291–302. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993. The composition of the painting has provided further support for this political interpretation. The horizontal format, with all figures represented on roughly the same level, delivered a seemingly egalitarian and socialist message.Wright, Alastair. “T.J. Clark’s ‘Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the 1848 Revolution’, 1973.” The Burlington Magazine 153, no. 1298 (May 2011): 330–34. Art historian T.J. Clark, however, has argued that the sociopolitical message of the painting is complex. Clark emphasizes the painting's stillness, ambiguity, and irony. At the time of the paintings creation, there was tension between peasants and the bourgeoisie, and though this painting may depict the rural bourgeoisie, it does not, according to Clark, take a stance on them. Clark instead claims that the painting simply represents rural French life, its structure, and permanence.Fried, Michael. “The Structure of Beholding in Courbet’s ‘Burial at Ornans.’” Critical Inquiry 9, no. 4 (June 1983): 635–83. Clark relates this message to the personal position of Courbet, whose family was not fully bourgeois, but was wealthy enough to own two homes. Rather than see the painting in terms of left and right politics, Clark interprets it as being about the subject of class. Other commentators have rejected both politics and class as key to the painting's meaning. Some have simply interpreted it as Courbet's effort to depict an event that took place in his hometown. The art critic Champfleury wrote at the time, "there is not a trace of socialism in A Burial at Ornans ... Fortunately, M. Courbet has not tried to prove anything by his Burial. It represents death of a citizen who is escorted to his last resting place by other citizens ... It has pleased the painter to show us the domestic life of a small town ... As to the alleged ugliness of the townspeople, there is nothing exaggerated about it."Mack, Gerstle (1989). Gustave Courbet. Da Capo. p. 80-1. . ==== Skull ==== The skull and bones sit at the bottom of the painting between the veterans and the clergymen. Its placement between groups of two opposing ideologies is thought to potentially comment on "human aspirations and failures," showing the pointlessness of idealogical contests, while also serving to emotionally move viewers.McCarthy, James C. “Courbet’s Ideological Contradictions and the Burial at Ornans.” Art Journal 35, no. 1 (Autumn 1975): 13. This interpretation sees the skull as an expression of Courbet's discontent with both traditional and revolutionary values. The skull is placed on the side of the grave closer to the veterans, which has sometimes been seen as a comment on revolutionaries. In traditional paintings of crucifixions, the side that the skull is placed on symbolizes those who "thrive on death," making the skull a potential comment on the violence of revolution.McCarthy, James C. “Courbet’s Ideological Contradictions and the Burial at Ornans.” Art Journal 35, no. 1 (Autumn 1975): 15. ==== Crucifix ==== The prominent position of the crucifix above all other figures is thought to symbolize the importance of Catholicism and traditional social values among the rural French population. At the same time, the inattentiveness of the church figures may serve as a witty commentary on the emptiness of the ritual they perform.McCarthy, James C. “Courbet’s Ideological Contradictions and the Burial at Ornans.” Art Journal 35, no. 1 (Autumn 1975): 14. Clark observes that there are all the elements of the burial ritual without their unison. Those attending the service are portrayed as indifferent to the presence of religion within the service, which may be interpreted as Courbet separating the two.Clark, T.J. (1973). Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the 1848 Revolution. Princeton: Princeton University Press. p. 80-83. Contemporary critics such as Proudhon also noticed this. He saw spirituality as being important in the death of a human, and he took the impious atmosphere of the scene to be a commentary on France losing its faith. Others, such as Hélène Toussaint, would later argue that the crucifix itself is a representation of hope that, after the 1848 Revolution, Christianity could be the basis for a rebuilding of French unity. This interpretation has often been disregarded due to the disconnect between those in the painting and the crucifix. ==== Veterans ==== The two veterans of the Revolution of '93 are represented in the painting in a light that was common at the time. They are worn down and old, standing proudly next to the grave, skull, and bones. Historian James C. McCarthy argues that their appearance likely represents both the contempt and compassion that Courbet felt towards them. McCarthy claims that the figures stood as a representation of "old-fashioned intransigence, a lack of contact with the latest revolutionary ideals, and a sense of frustration mingled with a certain bitterness." Additionally, Courbet may have represented them in this way due to his belief in non-violence. He described himself as a pacifist both early in life and later in his autobiography. He also expressed his disdain for violence after witnessing some of the horrors of the 1848 Revolution. === Controversies === Much of the controversy surrounding A Burial at Ornans centered on its monumental size. Its large scale had previously been reserved for history paintings, which academic doctrine held to be the highest genre. By depicting rural life at such a grand scale, Courbet scandalized audiences. In addition to the size, critics were displeased by the ugliness of the painting. They saw the composition as being crowded, disorganized, and without a clear focal point.Brooks, Peter. “Courbet’s House of Realism.” In Realist Vision, 71-95. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005. The work was also criticized for its impious presentation of death. At the time, scenes of death and funerals often delivered a religious message. This was true of the woodcuts that influenced Courbet. For example, Degrés des Âges presents a scene of heaven and hell underneath an aging couple. Many paintings of the subject also represent funeral attendees as mourning or pious, with the clergy shown as devoted. Both of these elements are absent in Burial. Some viewers may have seen this fact as a rightful criticism of contemporary funeral rituals. In 1849, there was a cholera outbreak, during which the funeral industry was faulted for price gouging. Additionally, questions had grown about the presence of the church and its efficacy. Some commentators also saw the painting as a scandalous celebration of France's declining religious faith.Kselman, Thomas A. “Courbet’s Burial At Ornans And The Cult Of The Dead.” In Death and Afterlife in Modern France, 291–302. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1993. While the painting was criticized for its ugliness and impiety, it was also praised for its realism and unprecedented representation of rural France. === Impact === Courbet is widely regarded as a leader of French Realism. Burial, as one of Courbet's most controversial works, helped bring Realism to the attention of the public. Additionally, some historians, such as Mack, believe that Courbet had an influence on the Impressionist movement. According to Mack, Courbet's works, and Burial in particular, allowed artists to explore new ways of painting and new subject matter.Mack, Gerstle (1989). Gustave Courbet.

64287028	A Burning	A Burning is a novel by Indian-born author Megha Majumdar released in June 2020. By December 2020, the novel was on 13 lists of the best books of 2020, according to Literary Hub. ==Plot== Set in Kolkata, India, the novel tells the story of its central character Jivan, a woman who witnesses a terrorist attack on an Indian train while it is stopped in a station. Jivan posts to Facebook the next day, drawing the attention of police who arrest her on suspicion of committing the terrorist attack. Following the accusation, her fate hinges upon her former gym teacher, PT Sir, who has become a politician in an Indian right-wing party, and on a hijra actress named Lovely. ==Background== In a 2020 interview with The Wall Street Journal, Majumdar explained the origin of the novel: :I think it came from reading the news and watching what was happening in India. I grew up in India, and my family’s still there. The right wing was ascendant, and communal tensions were being whipped up. [The country] was going in a direction that was really frightening. It’s truly contrary to this ideal of India that we were taught about since we were kids, the country whose plurality and diversity we were taught to celebrate. So I wanted to write about how individuals survive such a societal turn. ==Critical reception== The novel has received a wide range of critical reception. Ron Charles of The Washington Post wrote Majumdar "demonstrates an uncanny ability to capture the vast scope of a tumultuous society by attending to the hopes and fears of people living on the margins. The effect is transporting, often thrilling, finally harrowing. It’s no wonder this propulsive novel was chosen for the Today Show book club and leaped immediately onto the bestseller list." Grace Z. Li wrote for USA Today, "Majumdar's powerful debut is carefully crafted for maximum impact, carving out the most urgent parts of its characters for the whole world to see." In the Star Tribune, Anjali Enjeti wrote it "is a penetrating exposé about how the possibilities of fame and fortune gradually erode one’s integrity." James Woods wrote in The New Yorker, "Majumdar’s novel is compelling, yet its compulsions have to do with an immersive present rather than with a skidding sequence. Her characters start telling us about their lives, and those lives are suddenly palpable, vital, voiced." Tabish Khair wrote in The Hindu, "It is an excellent novel and an impressive debut", and "I grew up a Muslim who knew much about Hindu details of life but met excellent, well-meaning Hindus, including some of my school friends, who seemed to know nothing about Muslim details of life. And hence, I cannot help but notice this aridity in A Burning. And because the author of A Burning is a person of unusual talent and empathy, I want to bring it to her notice." Susan Choi wrote in The New York Times, "Majumdar is so far from exoticizing her setting as to be almost too economical, leaving the reader to snatch at clues where she can as to political, social and cultural context," and "Majumdar excels at depicting the workings of power on the powerless; for her characters, power is no abstract concept but a visceral assault on the body and its senses." In The Indian Express, Paromita Chakrabarti wrote the novel "is a quiet, searing study of the underclass and the aspiring middle class in India, whose tentative stake in the capitalist economy is complicated by the many tyrannies of gender, religion and class endemic to society." Harsimran Gill wrote for Scroll.in, "when Majumdar inhabits the perspective of Lovely, she falters. In stark contrast to the other characters, Lovely is given a peculiar voice and broken English for the entirety of the novel. [...] It’s a perplexing choice for a character whose story seems to have otherwise been crafted with care and thoughtfulness." Chakrabarti described restrictions on the teaching of English in government-funded primary schools in West Bengal that began in 1981 and extended for nearly two decades, and how therefore, "entire generations grew up with a shaky hold over the language," and wrote, "Majumdar packs in layers of history in her idiosyncratic use of the English language." Naina Bajekal wrote in Time, "Megha Majumdar presents a powerful corrective to the political narratives that have dominated in contemporary India." In The Financial Express, Ashutosh Bhardwaj describes the novel as "a disappointment, to say the least," and "just a mild stab at contemporary India that gets contended by perfunctory outlines and makes little attempt to capture the country in its nuances and complexities." In Newslaundry, Anand Vardhan writes, "In many ways, A Burning runs out of steam in elevating itself to the ambition of literature. Despite sporadic sparks of promise, it fails to look beyond the blind spots that abound in contemporary narratives on India." Amrita Dutta writes in The Indian Express, "Majumdar's economy of style and language extends, unfortunately, to an economy of specificities and details – one that produces an attenuated version of the complex, violent remaking of India, a version that is evidently easier on Western critics and publishing cultures." Rihan Najib writes in The Hindu Business Line, "Though the novel is adept at essaying contemporary Indian realities — taking on an Arundhati Roy- esque array of social justice issues such as development-induced displacement, Islamophobia, media trials, transphobia, income inequality, cow vigilantism — it does so with the broadest possible brush. [...] Nevertheless, Majumdar’s talents as a writer of the times is undeniable and she is certain to reach higher echelons of literary fame." Political anthropologist Irfan Ahmad wrote an extensive critique of the novel in The Caravan, stating, "What the novel does best is make visible what is starkly absent from the mainstream debates: state terrorism", and "It shifts the focus onto the terror of the state and its machinery, [...] But its description of this world, unlike that of the Urdu fiction, lacks the depth of cultural experience of what it means to be projected as a Muslim terrorist." ==Honors and awards== * Shortlist, 2021 Andrew Carnegie Medal for Excellence in Fiction * April 2022 Whiting Award ==References== Category:2020 American novels Category:Novels about terrorism Category:American thriller novels Category:Novels set in Kolkata Category:2020 debut novels Category:Literature by women Category:Alfred A.

62142087	A Burnt Child	A Burnt Child (Bränt barn) is a novel by the Swedish author Stig Dagerman, published in 1948. It is Dagerman's most widely read novel both in Sweden, where it has been published in ten editions, and internationally, with translations to twenty languages. The original title derives from the Swedish proverb "Bränt barn skyr elden" ("A burnt child dreads the fire"). An English translation of A Burnt Child was first published in 1950. In 2019, a translation of the novel was published by Penguin European Writers with the title A Moth to a Flame with a preface by Siri Hustvedt. ==Plot summary== "Set in a working-class neighborhood in Stockholm, the story revolves around a young man named Bengt who falls into deep, private turmoil with the unexpected death of his mother. As he struggles to cope with her loss, his despair slowly transforms to rage when he discovers his father had a mistress. But as Bengt swears revenge on behalf of his mother's memory, he also finds himself drawn into a fevered and conflicted relationship with this woman - a turn that causes him to question his previous faith in morality, virtue, and fidelity." (from Stig Dagerman US website) ==Critical reception== "This is a writer who sees life, and especially family life, under a burning glass; and the result is a novel of extraordinary power. It is an absorbing work." — The Observer, Review 1950 "A literary giant in Sweden, Dagerman conjures a Strindbergian atmosphere of shadowy menace in his brief, intense novel, A Moth to a Flame... The novel absorbs the reader effortlessly... The landscape round Stockholm, with its fog-bound flatlands and grey winter seas, is vividly evoked. This moody, death-haunted novel is well worth reading." — Evening Standard 2019 ==Adaptations== In 1949 Dagerman adapted the novel to the stage play Ingen går fri ("Nobody Walks Free"), which he directed himself. The novel has been filmed twice, the Swedish Bränt barn in 1967 and The French L'enfant brulé in 1991. ==References== Category:20th-century Swedish novels Category:1948 novels

867420	A Burnt-Out Case	A Burnt-Out Case (1960) is a novel by English author Graham Greene, set in a leper colony on the upper reaches of a tributary of the Congo River in Africa. ==Plot summary== Querry, a famous architect who is fed up with his celebrity, no longer finds meaning in art or pleasure in life. Arriving anonymously in the late 1950s at a Congo leper colony overseen by Catholic missionaries, Rozenberg Quarterly, December 2013. he is diagnosed – by Dr Colin, the resident doctor who is himself an atheist – as the mental equivalent of a 'burnt-out case': a leper who has gone through the stages of mutilation. However, as Querry loses himself in working for the lepers, his disease of mind slowly approaches a cure. Querry meets Rycker, a palm-oil plantation owner, and a man of apparently earnest Catholic faith who does not accept his own nothingness and tries to amplify the relevance of Querry's presence in that country. Rycker's wife, a young and ill-educated woman, is absolutely bored with his prudishness and her own lack of freedom. It is revealed that Querry is a famous architect, known throughout the world for his design and construction of churches – which he himself believes have been defiled by the religious occupants. Querry is persuaded to design and oversee a new building for the hospital. An English journalist called Parkinson arrives at the village with the intention of writing a series of articles, to be syndicated in many European and North American newspapers, on the subject of Querry's perceived 'saintly' activities in the village, including a story of Querry rescuing his servant – an African mutilated by leprosy- who became lost in the jungle. However Parkinson also brings up Querry's past not only as an architect but also as a womaniser. It is revealed that Querry's former lover committed suicide, thus prompting his journey to the village (however his journey was not the result of feelings of guilt or grief, but rather the incident acted to magnify his growing loss of faith and vocation.) When the first article is published and received at the village, Querry becomes angered by his portrayal, not only by Parkinson, but by Rycker whom Parkinson interviewed for the story. Querry travels to the provincial capital and on the way calls in to confront Rycker. Querry learns that Rycker's wife fears that she is pregnant and that her husband does not want a child (despite having refused contraception and having effectively forced her into sex numerous times). She tells Querry to ask Rycker for permission to travel to the capital Luc to see a doctor. Following a confrontation between Querry and Rycker, Querry leaves for Luc and takes with him Mrs. Rycker so she may visit the doctor, however neither of the two inform Rycker of her departure. Querry never becomes physically intimate with her. In Luc, Querry and Mrs. Rycker take rooms at the hotel. However, before going to sleep, Querry suspects that Mrs. Rycker is crying in the next room. When he investigates she informs him that she was actually laughing at the novel she is reading – one that would be banned at her home with the pious Rycker – and the two share a bottle of whisky. As Mrs. Rycker is going to sleep, Querry tells her a story which closely parallels his story: a man losing both faith and vocation. The following morning Parkinson informs Querry that Rycker has arrived in Luc in pursuit of his wife and, upon discovering his wife's diary with an entry stating "Spent the night with Q", Rycker accuses Querry of having an affair. Querry, after briefly meeting Mrs. Rycker and learning that she is pregnant with Rycker's child, leaves Luc and returns to the village, where the construction of the hospital is nearing completion. Days later Mrs. Rycker arrives at the convent near the village. She tells the sisters and priests that she has been having an affair with Querry and that she is pregnant with his child. When Querry visits her she claims that she thought of Querry whilst having sex with Rycker in an attempt to endure the man, and thus she became pregnant with what she views as Querry's child (despite it being Rycker's). Father Thomas, the temporary supervisor of the village, becomes angry at Querry for bringing shame and sin upon the village (as well as damaging his image as saintly – despite strong objections to having such an image from Querry himself). Rycker arrives at the village and demands to see Querry, who has gone to stay in Dr. Colin's room for the night. Rycker begins to walk to Dr. Colin's stating that a court would never convict him, which troubles the priests – one of whom pursues Rycker to prevent him shooting Querry. Enraged, Rycker confronts Querry. While being accused of adultery, Querry laughs at the absurdity of the accusations. Rycker misinterprets the laugh and becomes angry and shoots Querry, who then dies. Querry is buried in the village, which fulfills his wish to never return to his old life. ==Dedication and literary intentions in novel== Greene dedicated A Burnt-Out Case to Docteur Michel Lechat, a medical doctor at a leper colony in Yonda in Africa (one of a number of such colonies Greene had visited in the Congo and the Cameroons, which had inspired his novel). In his dedication to Lechat, Greene writes: "Doctor Colin has borrowed from you his experience of leprosy and nothing else. Doctor Colin's leproserie is not your leproserie.... From the fathers of your Mission I have stolen the Superior's cheroots--that is all, and from your Bishop the boat that he was so generous as to lend me for a journey up the Ruki." In reference to the characters in the novel, Greene writes: "It would be a waste of time for anyone to try to identify Querry, the Ryckers, Parkinson, Father Thomas--they are formed from the flotsam of thirty years as a novelist." Commenting on his literary intentions in the work, Greene wrote that it was, "an attempt to give dramatic expression to various types of belief, half- belief, and non-belief, in the kind of setting, removed from world-politics and house-hold-preoccupations, where such differences are felt acutely and find expression." Drawing a comparison between a leper-colony doctor's work and that of a novelist, Greene adds: "A doctor is not immune from 'the long despair of doing nothing well", the same "cafard that hangs around a writer's life". ==See also== *Burnout (psychology) ==References== Category:1960 British novels Category:Novels set in Belgian Congo Category:Novels by Graham Greene Category:Heinemann (publisher) books Category:Novels about architects
14356929	A Bus for a Bus on the Bus	"A Bus for a Bus on the Bus" is the debut single by English rock band Cardiacs, then known as Cardiac Arrest, released in 1979 under Tortch Records. The song's title recalls "A Pound for a Brown on the Bus" from the Mothers of Invention album Uncle Meat (1969). Until the release of The Special Garage Concerts Vol II, none of the tracks on the 7-inch single had been reproduced anywhere else. The single was supposed to contain four tracks and not three, but the limited space on the 7-inch format prevented it. The fourth track was to be "Keep Your Dead Mice with You", which was later re-recorded as "Dead Mouse" on the Toy World album. The single is one of the rarest Cardiacs items. == Recording == According to Pugh, Jim Smith broke the E string on his bass during recording. Before recording Cade bought some children's items from a newsagent and brought them to the session. Smith proceeded to give each member a different item and conducted them like an orchestra to make noises on "A Cake for Bertie's Party" during the middle section. During the recording of "Keep Your Dead Mice With You", which was at the end of the session, Smith and Pugh tried to put together a vocal harmony but it was not finished. The songs were mixed at the end of the session and 1000 copies were pressed. ==Reissues and alternate versions of tracks== Cardiac Arrest E.P. has never been reissued, and thus is one of the rarest Cardiacs releases. None of the tracks have ever been reissued from the original master, although tracks have had live versions appearing on other albums. *All three tracks were performed live on the 2005 live album The Special Garage Concerts Vol II *Versions of "A Bus for a Bus on the Bus" and "A Cake for Bertie's Party" appeared on the 2017 DVD Some Fairytales From the Rotten Shed. *The band SlapPeR released a version of the song in aid of Tim Smith in January 2020. ==Track listing== :A1.

2336309	A Bushel and a Peck	"A Bushel and a Peck" is a popular song written by Frank Loesser and published in 1950. The song was introduced in the Broadway musical Guys and Dolls, which opened at the 46th Street Theater on November 24, 1950. It was performed on stage by Vivian Blaine and a women's chorus as a nightclub act at the Hot Box. It is the first of two nightclub performances in the musical. Although Blaine later reprised her role as Miss Adelaide in the 1955 film version of the play, "A Bushel and a Peck" was omitted from the film and replaced by a new song, "Pet Me, Poppa." In the musical, the number can be performed either as "Miss Adelaide and her Chick Chick Chickadees," with the women dressed in yellow feathers, or as "Miss Adelaide and the Hot Box Farmerettes," where skimpy farmer outfits are worn (often jean cutoffs and checkered racing shirts or short gingham sundresses). The script calls the dancers the Farmerettes and describes the costume as "abbreviated Farmerette costumes with large hats and carrying rakes, hoes and pitchforks".Frank Loesser, Jo Swerling, Abe Burrows, Guys & Dolls, Music Theater International, New York, 1951, np. During the original production, the dancers wore large Daisy barrettes, with loose petals behind permanent ones. When they sang "He loves me, he loves me not," they would throw the loose petals into the audience.Susan Loesser, A Most Remarkable Fella, Donald I. Fine, Inc. New York, 1993, p.114 A number of popular singers released recordings of "A Bushel and a Peck" while the show was still in rehearsals. The most popular recording was by Perry Como and Betty Hutton, made on September 12, 1950, and released by RCA Victor.

35834066	A Business Career	A Business Career is a novel by African-American author Charles Chesnutt that features the life of a "new woman" of the late 19th century; she enters the world of business instead of embracing the traditional roles of women. It explores a failed romance between two successful upper-class members. A family’s vendetta against the man who allegedly destroyed the family's fortune is revealed to be mistaken. The novel was unusual for its time as Chesnutt wrote only about white society. The book was completed in 1890 but Chesnutt, who had published only a few short stories by then, was unable to interest a publisher in it. The book's depiction of white society may have contributed to that failure. Editor Walter Hines Page, who declined the book, nevertheless encouraged Chesnutt in his writing and later published other works by him. Since the late 20th century, there has been a revival of interest in Chesnutt. This novel was published posthumously in 2005 with an introduction and editing by Matthew Wilson. == Plot summary == The story takes place in 1890s in the Midwest city of Groveland (critics consider this a fictional stand-in for Cleveland, where Chesnutt lived). At the Truscott Refining Company, the male stenographer has just been fired. Stella Merwin fills in temporarily; she has already learned shorthand. When an opportunity opens up, she stays in the job longer than intended. The company is owned by the man whom her family believes has destroyed its reputation and honor. Stella Merwin's father, Henry, was a very successful man in the oil refining business, providing the Merwin family with status and a life of wealth. At the peak of his success, he hit financial troubles. These led to the loss of the family fortune as well as his death, attributed to heart disease. Before his death, Merwin assured his family: his wife, daughter Stella and son George, that they would be taken care of financially by his profitable investments. He directed them to see his most trusted employee, Wendell Truscott for assistance in the matter, as Merwin had given him related papers. With the loss of their wealth, the Merwins must change their lives. They move from the city to a small town where they lived off a small annual income produced by the estate and additional money earned from Mrs. Merwin’s writing career. This was enough money to give Stella a strong education, but a far cry from what the family was used to during their good times. Mrs. Merwin blames the family’s financial difficulties on Wendell Truscott because she believes that he ruined her husband and, stole money from him, and took over his company. Because of the complicated history between Wendell Truscott and the Merwin family, Stella Merwin takes her job under the false name Miss Smith. She wants the job in order to lean more about Truscott, whom she has been told to despise as the man who caused her family's financial downfall. Stella comes to swift judgments about her employer. She concludes that he is a cold-hearted boss who does not care about establishing relationships with his employees, but also that he is a very smart, savvy businessman who efficiently gets missions accomplished. Stella quickly takes a liking to her job, which starts out with her transcribing letters dictated by Truscott. Impressed with her performance, Truscott increases her responsibilities; he entrusts her to write letters according to his direction. instead of copying what the proprietor says, she gains his trust enough to write letters on her own, and gives her the charge of reviewing the financial books daily. Mrs. Merwin is thrilled that Stella is working for The Truscott Refining Company. She does not care that Stella is getting great experience in the business world and her schooling in shorthand is being put to good use; instead, she wants Stella to use her position in the office to infiltrate Truscott's files to find evidence that he committed fraud against Henry Merwin to restore the family to their previous position of wealth. Stella struggles slightly with the moral implications of betraying her boss, but she will do anything to help her family leading to her decision to find the incriminating documents. The mother visits her daughter and as they walk around the city she comments on how the rich residents made their money insisting that they did so in a dishonorable fashion. The only people that Mrs. Merwin believes amassed their fortune nobly are her husband and her friend Matilda Wedderburn. Besides for being Mrs. Merwin's old friend, Matilda Wedderburn is the love interest of Wendell Truscott. Matilda inherited great wealth from her father, and is a leader in literary and musical circles. She is a very independent woman whose only reason to marry is for true love because she has everything else on her own. Miss Weddburn and Truscott have known each other forever, but their courtship intensifies as they engage in activities together such as going to the theater. Matilda says Wendell is as close to her perfect man that she has ever met. She invites him to her home for dinner hoping that he will ask her to marry him there. Wendell has the same feelings for Miss Wedderburn so he writes a response to Matilda’s invitation that implies that he is planning on asking her to marry him that night; however, Truscott notices that his stenographer Miss Smith (Stella) is a beautiful young lady. He changes his mind when, "It occurred to him as he sat there, that perhaps a woman might be young in years, and yet not immature in mind, and that youth might possess a charm that maturity would lack." Truscott tears up the letter and instead writes a less passionate response. When that night comes the two are in an intimate setting in which Matilda expects Wendell to ask her to marry her, but instead he abruptly leaves crushing her hopes of marriage. Later on Miss Wedderburn visits the office of The Truscott Refining Company where she recognizes Miss Smith as the Merwin’s daughter, and she suspects that the young stenographer is the reason Truscott has a change of heart. While reviewing the daily reports Stella notices that something is inconsistent in the books, so she decides to look into the matter on a Sunday when nobody will be in the office. After reviewing the books she concludes that the bookkeeper Mr. Ross has stolen $20,000 from the company. While Stella is still there Ross comes in and finds the ledger on his desk along with a piece of paper that Stella had written on. Mr. Ross finds Stella hiding in the closet and knocks her out. Stella wakes up locks in a wardrobe; luckily she is able to escape by climbing through the roof of the wardrobe so she can go alert Mr. Truscott about Mr. Ross’s transgression. Truscott is very pleased that she discovers this crime, but by the time they inform the authorities Ross leaves town and makes it all the way to a South American country where there is no extradition. The next Sunday Stella again visits the office in order to search for the documents believed to because this time in search of the documents that will restore her family's wealth. Stella believes the necessary papers are in the safe in Truscott's private office that she access to because of his special trust in her. She looks through the safe without success, but she knows there is a special compartment with an additional lock. She gets the key from Truscott's desk and successful finds the papers in the locked compartment. At the same time Stella is in the office, Truscott goes to a dinner at the Country Club hosted by General Farwell. At the dinner the wealthy guests receive news from Wall Street that a bank in London collapsed and a financial crisis is imminent. Truscott is hit hard by the crisis and as a result cannot get banks to lend him money for the big project he has been working on thereby putting it on the verge of failure. Stella reviews the papers in her boarding house that night. The papers show the scheme that her father was planning that is very similar to Truscott's current endeavor revolutionizing the oil refining industry. The papers show $2 million in stock that her father has investment in his new company Universal Subterranean Development Company. She believes that this is the evidence that will prove their wealth; however, Stella then sees through the documents how her father's plan failed because of an economic collapse and the failures of his unscrupulous business partners. This proves that Wendell Truscott never stole from her father; it was Henry Merwin’s own fault that the family lost its fortune. Stella's findings cement the family's place outside the upper class of society and prevent Mrs. Merwin's dream of returning to their previous life impossible. She also learns that the income the family has been receiving was not generated by the Merwin estate but actually is Truscott's charity for the family. Stella returns the stolen papers to Mr. Truscott accompanied by a letter explaining her true identity as well as giving him her reason for resignation of the position. She thanks him for his generosity to the family and apologizes for taking advantage of the trust he showed her. The Truscott Refining Company is at the brink of collapse because the company needs $200,000 that it owes to its creditors. Luckily Matilda Wedderburn comes to Truscott’s rescue, even though he put their romance to an end, by offering her good friend the money that he desperately needs therefore saving the company. Stella moves back to Cloverdale leaving Groveland in her rear-view mirror because she wants to forget about her experience working for Wendell Truscott as much as possible. She soon receives a letter from Truscott asking her to come back to work because he cannot find anyone who did as good a job as she did, but more importantly he wants her to come back because she loves him. In the letter Truscott says, "Come back to me, dear child, or let me come to you, and we will part no more forever, as long as we both shall live." == Characters == Stella Merwin (Miss Smith): The protagonist of the novel is a "new woman" of the late 19th century who pursues a life outside the traditional roles of wife and mother. As a junior in college, she learns shorthand, which enables her to secure a job as a stenographer. She works for The Truscott Refining Company with the objective of trying to find documents to restore her family’s wealth. Wendell Truscott: The wealthy proprietor of the Truscott Refining Company whom the Merwin family blames for their financial ruin. He is a crafty businessman. It is revealed that he never betrayed his mentor Henry Merwin, but provided for his family. Mrs. Paxton: Stella’s mentor who gets her the job at Truscott Refining. She guides Stella in the business world and becomes a friend. Mr. Peters: The former stenographer, fired for tardiness due to excessive drinking. Mr. Ross: The bookkeeper of Truscott Refining, who steals $20,000 from the company, but escapes to South America. Stella Merwin's judgment of him is proved true by events. Matilda Wedderburn: A beautiful, wealthy woman being courted by Wendell Truscott. Her hopes of marrying him end when he "falls for" Stella Merwin. As a friend, she loans Truscott money to save the company. Mrs. Merwin: The mother of Stella and George, and wife of Henry Merwin. The widow has trouble dealing with her decline in status and yearns to return to her high place in society George Merwin: Stella’s brother, who also lives and works in Groveland. George has a gambling problem and falls into debt, leading to his arrest. He is saved by a stranger, revealed to be Wendell Truscott, whom the Merwin family considers an enemy. He is sent to a ranch in the West for rehabilitation. == Themes == === The new women === The major theme of this novel is the emergence of the new woman in American society at the turn of the century. Mrs. Merwin exemplifies the traditional female role as a mother and wife, but Stella Merwin pursues higher education. Her schooling allows her to get a job in the business world that pays a substantial salary. Stella has the financial independence to thrive without relying on a husband. During this period, the number of women working in offices, previously limited to men, was on the rise. Gradually women replaced men as clerks and stenographers. === Status === Chesnutt explores the financial inequality in the structure of society. This era was known for the vast disparity in wealth between the classes, as the upper class lived in luxurious mansions with many servants and enjoyed the theatre, but the lower class struggled through life by working long hours in a factory or office. The Merwins family's drastic decline in financial standing is similar to that of the title character in William Dean Howells' novel The Rise of Silas Lapham, now considered a literary classic. Chesnutt explores Mrs. Merwin's difficulty as a beleaguered widow, no longer in the upper class. === Realism === Chesnutt wrote a novel of Realism, portraying society, as was the major form of his time. He did not use a high style of elaborate language or refer to the mythical characters popular in an earlier generation. The novel effectively captures the business world by describing The Truscott Refining Company’s inner workings. === Romance === The novel follows the form of a romance, as Matilda Wedderburn and Wendell Truscott engage in a courtship. This fails after he falls for his young stenographer. The courtship is highlighted by nights out at the theatre and dinner parties with the family. It omits the sexual component prevalent in modern courtship and portrayed in current literature. The romantic plot was also featured in Howells' novel, The Rise of Silas Lapham. ==Context== When Chesnutt completed his novel in 1890, he was unable to find a publisher for it. At the time he had published only a few short stories set in the South, recounting the culture of slave life on plantations. Although Houghton Mifflin chose not to publish the novel, editor Walter Hines Page advised Chesnutt, "You will doubtless be able to find a publisher, and my advice to you is decidedly to keep trying till you do find one." Page encouraged Chesnutt in his career, and later Houghton Mifflin published other works by him. Twenty- first century scholar Matthew Wilson believes Chesnutt may have been trying to appeal in this work to white readers, who made up most of the market for literature. Chesnutt, along with Paul Laurence Dunbar, was one of the first African-American writers to write in the "white life" genre, to portray only white characters and white society. Dunbar’s novel, The Uncalled, was published in 1901,The Uncalled (1901), Gutenberg Project but failed to sell successfully. Matthew Wilson says about African-American authors at the turn of the 20th century: > "Very little expressed interest in representations of whiteness in the black > imagination. Black cultural and social critics allude to such > representations in their writing, yet only a few have dared to make explicit > those perceptions of whiteness that they think will discomfort or antagonize > readers." He describes Chesnutt and Dunbar as pushing the prescribed limits of race in their writings. Charles Chesnutt viewed his work differently than most in terms of its racial implications. After receiving an award from the NAACP in the early 1900s, Chesnutt said he was "Not a Negro writing about Negroes, but a human being writing about other human beings." He did not see color in his writing. But, many critics considered African Americans to be inferior writers who had to stay in their own "league". At the time, books about the antebellum South were popular. It was a time of reconciliation between the North and South, and members of the Northern literary establishment were interested in black writers who portrayed the slavery years. Chesnutt published his novels A House Behind the Cedars (1900) and The Marrow of Tradition (1901), following his success with two short story collections in 1899. They addressed issues of racial inequality and racial mixing. But The Marrow of Tradition went further, featuring a range of white characters, who included an elite white family, as well as a black family of mixed race. Young women in the two families were half-sisters who had the same white father, a man of the elite class. Chesnutt also addressed competition among classes of whites by the late 19th century, as some lower-class men achieved new wealth and political power. Based on the background to North Carolina's disfranchisement of blacks in the late 1890s and events of the 1898 Wilmington Race Riot, in which whites conducted a coup d'état of the elected city government, the novel was described by William Dean Howells as "bitter." It is not known whether Chesnutt tried to find another publisher for A Business Career, but it was among his six unpublished manuscripts found at the time of his death. In his introduction to this novel, editor Mathew Wilson says, "African American writers have had no right to represent white-life exclusively because to grant that right would be to acknowledge the permeability of the color line". Wilson believes that Chesnutt has still not received the recognition he deserves for this pioneering effort in crossing the color line to write about white society. == Critical reception == When it was published in 2005 over a century after it was written, A Business Career received little attention from critics or readers. One of the first of its kind, the novel has faded to the edge of American Literature. == Bibliography == *Chesnutt, Charles W., A Business Career, ed.

1568715	A Busy Day	thumb|150px|thumbtime=7|upright=1.5|A Busy Day A Busy Day is a 1914 short film starring Charlie Chaplin and Mack Swain. ==Plot== In A Busy Day, a wife (played by an energetic Charlie Chaplin) becomes jealous of her husband's interest in another woman during a military parade. On her way to attack the couple, the wife interrupts the set of a film, knocking over a film director and a police officer. Finally, the husband pushes the wife off a pier and she falls into the harbor. ==Notes== According to the 1965 book The Films of Charlie Chaplin, A Busy Day is the first of three films in which Chaplin plays a woman. The other two were The Masquerader (1914) and A Woman (1915). Chaplin used the wardrobe of fellow Keystone player Alice Davenport. It was typical for Mack Sennett to shoot Keystone comedies using real events—such as a parade—as the background for comic mayhem. This short film (about half a reel) was shot near San Pedro Harbor in less than two hours. In it, one can see interesting glimpses of First World War-era American naval ships in the background. The other part of the reel is an educational short titled The Morning Papers. ==Review== A reviewer from Bioscope noted, "[Chaplin] gives an amazing exhibition of acrobatic humor." ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin as Wife * Mack Swain as Husband * Phyllis Allen as The Other Woman * Mack Sennett as Film director * Billy Gilbert as Police officer * Ted Edwards as Police officer ==External links== * * * * Category:1914 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Short films directed by Charlie Chaplin Category:1914 comedy films Category:American silent short films Category:Silent American comedy films Category:Keystone Studios films Category:Films produced by Mack Sennett Category:1914 short films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:American comedy short films Category:Mutual Film films Category:1910s English-language films Category:1910s American films

51124146	A C Bertelli	thumb|Enfield-Allday-10/20-Monoposto by Augustus Bertelli, 1919 Augustus Cesare Bertelli (1890–1979), known as "Bert" to his colleagues or "Gus" to his family, was an Anglo-Italian car designer, racing driver, mechanic, and businessman. Bertelli was born in Genoa, Italy on 23 March 1890. In 1894 the family emigrated and settled in Cardiff, South Wales where after leaving school he was taken on as an apprentice at a local steel works. He studied in the evenings at University College to gain technical qualifications and gained also a lifetime interest in rugby. He returned to Italy and got a job in the development department of FIAT in Turin and while there met racing driver Felice Nazzaro and was taken on as a riding mechanic winning the 1908 Targa Bologna. Just before the outbreak of World War I he returned to the United Kingdom and studied aeronautical engineering and got a job in the design office of Grahame-White in Hendon, North London where he remained until 1918. After the war he was called in as a consultant to overcome problems at Enfield-Allday where their first car was suffering design and cost problems and was soon employed there full time as Works Manager but was unable to save the company which collapsed in 1923. Enfield-Alldays had made a few racing cars based on their 10/20 model which Bertelli had driven with some success. Even before Enfield-Alldays had failed Bertelli was working as a consultant assisting such companies as Armstrong Siddeley, Coventry Simplex and Rover. During this time he met Woolf Barnato and built at his Lingfield, Surrey house three cars based on Enfiled-Alldays chassis. While working at Armstrong Siddeley he had met William Renwick, an engineer who had inherited a great deal of money, and the two formed a company Renwick & Bertelli Ltd in Birmingham in 1924. The product of this partnership was a car called the R & B but known informally as "Buzzbox". This used a four cylinder 1.5 Litre overhead camshaft again mounted in an Enfield-Alldays chassis. The pair came to the notice of the Hon. John Benson whose mother Lady Charnwood had recently bought Bamford and Martin and in 1926 Bertelli and Renwick both joined the board of what became Aston Martin Motors Ltd. Buzzbox would become the basis of a new range of cars. Aston Martin went through a succession of owners and in 1928 was purchased by Sidney Whitehouse who also bought Renwick & Bertelli and merged the companies. In 1931 Renwick left the company and moved to the United States. Bertelli remained with Aston Martin until 1938, when following differences with R. Gordon Sutherland, son of the owner Sir Arthur Munro Sutherland, he resigned and returned to his previous occupation as an engineering consultant. He was then approached by Wallace Devereux of High Duty Alloys, a subsidiary of Hawker Siddeley, and asked to design a car but World War II broke out before a prototype was completed and work stopped. He continued however to work for High Duty Alloys until he retired in 1955. In 1940 the family had moved to a 150 acre farm at Wargrave, Berkshire where they raised pigs. ==Private life== Gus Bertelli married Vera ShawVera Beatrice M Shaw, birth registered Paddington 1895, FreeBMD accessed 18 September 2016 in 1920 and the couple had three children, two daughters and a son.

69226693	A C Jacobs	A C Jacobs (Arthur C. Jacobs) was a Scottish poet, born in Glasgow in 1937, he died in Madrid in 1994. Jacobs was Jewish, wrote in Yiddish and English, and was a gifted translator of Hebrew. Jacobs grew up in a traditional Jewish family who were immigrants from Russia. He studied at the University of Glasgow with Philip Hobsbaum and his early work was published in the Leeds magazine Stand by Jon Silkin. Jacobs' poetry is described as exploring questions of nationality and language. In his obituary, his editor Anthony Rudolf said: "Many of Jacobs's poems celebrate Jewish life or honour Jewish death, sometimes with a tartan tinge" and in a collection of poems highlighted "his complex cultural identity as a Jew in Scotland, as a Scot in England, and as a diaspora Jew in Israel, Italy, Spain and the UK". He variously used his un-Jewish name Arthur, his adopted Hebrew name, Chaim, signing himself as Arthur C. and A. C. Jacobs. == References == Category:Scottish poets Category:Scottish Jewish writers Category:Scottish Jews Category:1937 births Category:1994 deaths

He was the first African American to serve as mayor of Shelby County.Harold Ford Jr. Reaches For the Stars, Time magazine, 10 December 2002 ==Early life, education, and early career == A C Wharton was born and raised in Lebanon, Tennessee. A C Wharton shares his name with his father and grandfather, and named his eldest son by the same name. Wharton has stated that his first name is simply the letters "A" and "C" and does not stand for anything else. He graduated from Tennessee State University with a degree in political science and earned a J.D. degree from the University of Mississippi. He became an academic, teaching at the university for 25 years. In 1980, then-Shelby County Mayor Bill Morris appointed Wharton as Chief Shelby County Public Defender. His concern for the mentally ill in the criminal justice system resulted in the Jericho Initiative, which became a national model program.Mayor A C Wharton Launches the Jericho Initiative, Shelby County Government press release, March 3, 2009. Archived by archive.org on May 28, 2010. He chaired the county's Jail Overcrowding Committee and developed new ways to reduce overcrowding without compromising public safety. ==Shelby County Mayor== In 2002 Wharton was elected as the first African- American mayor of Shelby County. He became a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, a group with the stated goal of "making the public safer by getting illegal guns off the streets." Wharton initiated Operation Safe Community.Memphis Fast Forward: Operation Safe Community http://memphisfastforward.com/category/operation-safe-community/ In addition, he developed a program to help prisoners develop the skills to succeed in life and to support their families. He increased funding for the drug court. He is credited with working to toughen gun laws and seeking passage of laws that make criminals pay into a special program to help victims. Wharton improved the management and accountability of the county's Head Start program. His reforms attracted the attention of the United States Congress, where he was called to testify before the House Committee on Education, with many of his subsequent recommendations being incorporated as changes to public policy. He was a strong advocate "Books from Birth," a unique early-childhood education program which provides books for over 28,000 children in Memphis and Shelby County every year."One For the Books,", Commercial Appeal, 30 June 2009 Between 2008 and 2009, Wharton convened and led the community-wide effort which led to the drafting of Sustainable Shelby, an environmentally sustainable agenda for the county."Sustainable Shelby: A Future of Choice, Not Chance," http://www.dpdgov.com/(plawzh553mnt5bzljfjhp43w)/portal/portal_content.aspx?ID=36&component;=news&dept;=dpd&cmid;=97 ==Memphis mayor== ===Election=== In June 2009, Wharton announced his intentions to run for mayor of Memphis in a special election to replace Mayor W.

He created the city's Office of Talent and Capital in 2010 in an effort to promote employment in the city. In September 2013, a U.S. Chamber of Commerce Foundation report recognized Memphis as a paradigm for a government focused on job creation, crime reduction, and economic growth.

9341936	A Cage of Butterflies	A Cage of Butterflies is a 1992 young adult novel by Australian author Brian Caswell. == Plot summary == The story is set in a research facility (known as the "farm") involving two groups of people. The first group contains several teenagers with IQs above 150. These teenagers (Greg, Mikki, Lesley, Gordon, Gretel, Katie and Chris) call themselves the "Think Tank". However, this group is merely a smokescreen for the real subjects of the research - five seven- year-olds who are able to communicate telepathically, known as the "Babies". The Babies are called Pep, Ricardo, Ian, Rachael and Myriam. The Babies were all born around the same time in the same hospital. When the members of the first group are "contacted" by the Babies, they learn of the researchers' exploitation, and, with the help of compassionate workers at the facility (Susan and Erik), investigate the reason for the Babies' condition. The Babies need help as the head researcher, Larsen, will stop at nothing to solve the mystery. The Think Tank, as well as researcher Susan and young orderly Erik, provide this help. They trick the head researcher, John Larsen, so they can escape. The story ends with the Think Tank six years into the future. They turned the think tank into 'Think Tank Inc.', a company worth three million dollars. The Babies, Think Tank and newlyweds Erik and Susan all live together. Greg and Mikki are also married. The title, "A Cage of Butterflies" refers to the fact that Larsen and the research staff keep both the Babies and the think tank under constant supervision and keep them "caged" or "prisoners" since they do not allow them to move around freely. == Characters == === Think Tank === *Greg *Mikki *Katie *Lesley *Gordon *Gretel *Chris === Researchers/scientists === *Larsen *Susan *Erik *MacIntyre *Richard (formerly) === The Babies === *Ian (twins with Rachael) *Myriam *Ricardo *Rachael *Pep == Awards == * Shortlisted 3M Talking Book of the Year Award 1993 * Shortlisted CBCA Book of the Year Awards Older Readers 1993 == References == Category:1992 novels Category:Australian young adult novels Category:Children's science fiction novels Category:Australian science fiction novels Category:1992 science fiction novels Category:University of Queensland Press books Category:1992 children's books

It ends in December 1941, with an open-ended conclusion clearly leaving the possibility of a sequel. However, for many years afterwards Follet wrote on other subjects, only in 2004 coming up with the long-delayed sequel A Forest of Eagles - followed immediately by a final volume of what became a trilogy, Return of the Eagles. ==Allusions and references== ===Allusions to actual history=== The camp depicted existed in reality, and much of the book is based on real-life information gathered by Follet in the course of writing an earlier book, the 1979 novel U-700.

8981838	A Calendar of Wisdom	thumb A Calendar of Wisdom (, ), also known as Path of life, A Cycle of Readings or Wise Thoughts for Every Day, is a collection of insights and wisdom compiled by Leo Tolstoy between 1903 and 1911 that was published in three different editions. An English translation by Archibald J. Wolfe of the first Russian edition, which was organized by subject, was published in 1919. An English translation of the second Russian edition, which was organized by calendar date, was begun in 1911 as a monthly serial but abandoned after the first volume. The first translation of the entire yearly cycle, but which omitted some of the individual readings, was made by Peter Sekirin and published in 1997. The book, whose title is literally translated as Circle of Reading, was described by Tolstoy as "a wise thought for every day of the year, from the great philosophers of all times and all people" which he himself would consult daily for the rest of his life. Teachings from historical figures including Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius, Lao-Tzu, Buddha, Pascal, Jesus, Muhammad, Confucius, Emerson, Kant, Ruskin, Seneca, Socrates, Thoreau prompted Tolstoy to write in the introduction, "I hope that the readers of this book may experience the same benevolent and elevating feeling which I have experienced when I was working on its creation, and which I experience again and again when I reread it every day, working on the enlargement and improvement of the previous edition." The translator, Peter Sekirin, explains that this was Tolstoy's last major work. He put an enormous amount of effort into this collection over a period of 15 years. He carefully selected the contributors and they cover a wide range of philosophical views. Tolstoy grouped the thoughts according to a topic for each day of the year, and he added his own thoughts to each daily entry. An edition of A Calendar of Wisdom was published in Russia in 1912 but was forbidden by the Soviet regime. It was republished in Russia in 1995 and was a great success, selling over 300,000 copies. ==See also== * Leo Tolstoy bibliography ==References== *Tolstoy, Leo.

62485656	A Calf for Christmas	A Calf for Christmas (original title: När Bäckhultarn for till stan) is a children's book by Astrid Lindgren. == Plot == Johann is sad because Embla, the cow of his family, has died. It was the only cow that the family had. Soon it will be Christmas, but without the cow and its milk, it is going to be a very sad one. Meanwhile, a rich farmer buys a calf in the town. Afterwards, he goes into a pub and gets drunk. On his way back to the farm, he falls asleep on the carriage. But his horse keeps running, it knows the way back. When the farmer wakes up, he hears a loud roar of the calf. He believes it is the devil and throws the calf out of the carriage. Then he continues his way home. Johann discovers the calf in the snow and he is overjoyed. He believes that god has sent him this Christmas present and he can keep the calf, but his father says it may belong to someone and wants to find out to whom. Johann and his father find out that the calf belongs to the rich farmer and visit him. The farmer realizes how important the calf is to Johann. That's why he gives the calf to Johann. In return, Johann and his father should not tell how they got the calf. Johann is happy, this is a wonderful Christmas present. == Background == A Calf for Christmas was based on a story that Astrid Lindgren was told by her father Samuel August Ericsson. Once he told Astrid Lindgren of a drunken barkeeper from Frödinge, who bought a calf from his brother. Ericsson helped the barkeeper to put the calf into a bag so the barkeeper was able to take it home with him on his carriage. Afterwards the barkeeper went to the pub and drank. On his way back, he did not remember buying a calf. When he suddenly heard a terrible roar from the calf, he believed that this was the devil and threw the calf off the wagon. This story was later told throughout the village. When Ericsson met the barkeeper again, he asked him mockingly, what had become of the calf. The barkeeper sensed that Ericsson knew about the story. He replied that this calf had made a long journey.Catharina Stackelberg: Astrid Lindgren erzählt aus ihrem Leben (Astrid Lindgrens Småland). (film) In: 100 Jahre Astrid Lindgren Jubiläumsedition. DVD. Universum Film. In Sweden, the story was first published in 1951 as När Bäckhultarn for till stan in the book En bil kommer lastad. Within the first month, the book had already sold more than 30,000 times. The book has been translated into many languages, among them are English, German and Dutch. English Edition has been illustrated by Marit Törnqvist. == Reception == The German child and adolescent psychiatrist Michael Schulte-Markwort believes A Calf for Christmas is one of the most beautiful stories for bereaved counsel and comfort. It could help readers or listeners to cope with the strokes of fate.Michael Schulte-Markwort (2017): Kindersorgen: Was unsere Kinder belastet und wie wir ihnen helfen können. P. 16 Kirkus Reviews praises the well-told story. It is a mix of satire and sober realism. The watercolors by Marit Törnqvist are beautiful and "a fine complement to this unusual glimpse of rural Sweden at the turn of the century". Natalia Bragaru believes that A Calf for Christmas, like all Astrid Lindgren's books, has "multiple layers". It provides information about the harsh realities of the daily life on a farm in Sweden, telling of the gap between the poor and the rich, the traditions of the farmers, as well as of love, hope and the belief in miracles. ==See also== * List of Christmas-themed literature ==References== Category:Swedish children's literature Category:1950 children's books Category:Christmas children's books Category:20th-century Swedish literature Category:Works by Astrid Lindgren Category:Rabén & Sjögren books
66054729	A California Christmas	A California Christmas is a 2020 Christmas film directed by Shaun Paul Piccinino, written by Lauren Swickard and starring Swickard, Josh Swickard and Amanda Detmer. A sequel, A California Christmas: City Lights was released 16 December 2021. == Plot == Joseph Van Aston lives a carefree life and is the son of a wealthy San Francisco real estate tycoon (his mom). He spends his time womanizing and enjoying his rich lifestyle. His mom sends him to Petaluma to close a deal to buy a dairy farm that has continuously refused a buyout to purchase the land. Callie Bernet is a hardworking and headstrong woman, whose farm is more valuable to her than any monetary value, despite being heavily in debt. She lives on the ranch with her mother Wendy, who has cancer, and her little sister Hannah. Joseph arrives at the farm and meets Callie, who is busy with a cow giving birth to a calf. He is mistaken for the new ranch hand Manny who is set to arrive soon, and assists Callie with the birth. He decides to take advantage of this in an attempt to gain Callie's trust, and despite no experience on a farm, continues to pose as Manny. Meanwhile, Joseph sends his butler Leo to find the real Manny and pay him not to show up at the farm. Manny capitalizes on the situation by making lavish requests in return for his silence. Manny stays at an Airbnb with Leo, where they pamper themselves, play video games, and drink fine wine throughout the day. Leo finds that Manny has an uncanny ability to determine every note in the wines. Manny also provides farming advice to Joseph, who is in over his head. Over time Joseph becomes more adept on the farm and grows closer to the Bernet family. Joseph and Callie soon develop feelings for each other and Callie shows Joseph a small abandoned vineyard on the property—left behind by Callie's late father. She occasionally gifts (but does not sell) the previously bottled wine, and they end up sharing part of a bottle. As Christmas approaches, Joseph attempts to tell Callie the truth about who he is, but never finds the right moment. He also continually ignores his mother's calls for a status update on the ranch deal. Joseph's mother takes matters into her own hands and comes to the ranch, fully exposing the con, and pressures Callie to accept the deal to pay off her mother's extensive medical bills. Callie refuses the offer and kicks out Joseph, though Joseph stands up to his mother and pleads to help save the ranch. Leo and Manny taste the wine from the ranch from the leftover bottle Joseph had and realize it's one of the best wines they've ever tasted. The three of them bring the wine to a prominent wine expert and the wine expert agrees on the quality. Joseph goes back to the abandoned vineyard on his own and helps spruce up the area. Callie finds him working on the vineyard and although still angry at him, works with him to make the vineyard presentable. The wine expert visits the vineyard and ends up purchasing the remainder of Callie's father's wine in the cellar and also leases the existing vines for the future. With the purchase and future commissions from sales, it is enough to keep the ranch in Callie's hands. Joseph secretly fixes up Callie's old barn and a Christmas / saving-the-ranch celebration takes place, where Callie eventually forgives him and they reconcile. Sometime in the future, Joseph and Callie are sitting on a bench in the now thriving vineyard. Wedding rings are visible on their hands. == Cast == == Production == Filming took place in Petaluma, California over a three and a half week period and both cast and crew had to follow strict COVID requirements.

1798912	A Call for Unity	"A Call for Unity" was an open letter published in Birmingham, Alabama, on April 12, 1963, by eight local white clergymen in response to civil rights demonstrations taking place in the area at the time. In the letter, they took issue with events "directed and led in part by outsiders," and they urged activists to engage in local negotiations and to use the courts if rights were being denied, rather than to protest. The term "outsider" was a thinly-veiled reference to Martin Luther King Jr., who replied four days later, with his famous "Letter from Birmingham Jail." He argued that direct action was necessary to protest unjust laws. The authors of "A Call for Unity" had written "An Appeal for Law and Order and Common Sense" in January 1963. ==Signatories== * C.

64364158	A Call to Spy	A Call to Spy (also known as Liberté: A Call to Spy) is a 2019 American spy drama film written and produced by Sarah Megan Thomas and directed by Lydia Dean Pilcher. The title is a stylistic variant of a call to arms. The film is a heavily fictionalized historical drama inspired by the lives of three women who worked as British spies during World War II. In many important respects the plot deviates quite widely from actual events and from their real-life missions. It stars Sarah Megan Thomas, Radhika Apte and Stana Katic. A Call to Spy had its world premiere on June 21, 2019, at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, and was released in the United States on October 2, 2020, in theaters and on video on demand. The film received mostly positive reviews. Film critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes said it "overcomes a surprising lack of tension with an overall engaging tribute to an oft-overlooked group of World War II heroes." ==Synopsis== In the beginning of WWII, with Britain becoming desperate, Churchill orders his new spy agency—the Special Operations Executive (SOE)—to recruit and train women as spies. Their daunting mission: conduct sabotage and build a resistance. SOE's "spymistress," Vera Atkins (Stana Katic), recruits two unusual candidates: Virginia Hall (Sarah Megan Thomas), an ambitious American with a wooden leg, and Noor Inayat Khan (Radhika Apte), an Indian Muslim pacifist. Together, these women help to undermine the Nazi regime in France, leaving an unmistakable legacy in their wake. ==Cast== ==Production== Sarah Megan Thomas wrote the original screenplay based on years of research, and to prepare for her role as Virginia Hall, she interviewed Hall's living relatives. Pilcher has said that she was drawn to this story because she felt a story about the power of multiculturalism was relevant to the current-day rise of nationalism and extremism, and she wanted to feature a story about these women who hadn't received enough attention or acknowledgement in history. To prepare for the role of Noor Inayat Khan, Radhika Apte did a lot of research, which included reading about the historical people as well as watching spy movies and reading classic novels that were relevant to the character. Filming was done in Philadelphia and Budapest, both of which also provided tax credits to the production. ==Release and reception== The film had its world premiere as Liberté: A Call to Spy at the Edinburgh International Film Festival during the commemoration of the 75th anniversary of D-Day, which Thomas believed was a notable choice because historically the agency trained their spies in Scotland. The film went on to win the Audience Choice Award in record numbers at Whistler Film Festival, where 97% voted for it as their favorite film, "the highest numbers since La La Land took home the prize." The film also won an award from the Alliance of Women Film Journalists. The film was given the Anti-Defamation League Award at the 2020 Santa Barbara International Film Festival with a unanimous vote by the jury. IFC Films then acquired North American distribution rights, with an expected theatrical release in late 2020. The film has been well reviewed by critics and well received by audiences on the festival circuit. Screen Daily noted that it was "one title to stand out." On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, A Call to Spy holds an approval score of 73% based on 48 reviews, and an average rating of 6.2. The site's critics consensus reads, "A Call to Spy overcomes a surprising lack of tension with an overall engaging tribute to an oft-overlooked group of World War II heroes" In the United Kingdom, A Call to Spy was released by Signature Entertainment on October 23, 2020, to positive reviews by top outlets. A review by The Times said: "Inspired by true stories, A Call to Spy is a compelling tale of extraordinary courage and sacrifice.... Each woman left an unmistakable legacy and the film is a tribute to their bravery and ingenuity." The Guardian called the film a "[m]eticulous depiction of female war-time agents" and The Sunday Mirror said it was "[a] powerful and inspiring film about women who left a vital legacy." Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com gave A Call to Spy 3.5 out of 4 stars: "An excellent historical drama. I was engrossed for every moment of the film's 123-minute running time." Indiewire called the film "A Sturdy Drama about WWII's overlooked female spies. Sarah Megan Thomas is the standout here, with the multi-hyphenate not only taking on the film's meatiest role as real-life spy figure Virginia Hall, but also writing and producing the feature." Cosmopolitan called it one of 31 "spy thrillers that’ll have you on the edge of your damn seat." In India, Amazon acquired the film as an "Amazon Original", where it received strong reviews. The Times of India said, "Backed by spectacular performances and strong writing, ‘A Call to Spy’ is a realistic and engaging spy-thriller that packs a solid emotional punch." == References == ==External links== * * * Category:2019 films Category:2019 war drama films Category:2010s American films Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s historical drama films Category:2010s spy drama films Category:American historical drama films Category:American spy drama films Category:American war drama films Category:Films about capital punishment Category:Films shot in Budapest Category:Films shot in Philadelphia Category:World War II films based on actual events

13363798	A Call to the Martyrs	A Call to the Martyrs is the debut album from the Christian deathcore band Mortal Treason. == Critical reception == Andrew Sinft from Jesus Freak Hideout writes: "All in all, A Call to the Martyrs is a solid album and is a must have for any fan of metal or hardcore. Highlights include "Khampa Nomads," "A Walk Thru the Woods," and "Feed on the Weak" (which has an amazing breakdown). The biggest disappointment is the fact that other than a short acoustic track, the album is only eight songs long. Like the band, the album is strong but could have lasted longer." Mortal Treason from Alabama have been around for about five years now, defying mainstream Christian music tastes with their growing hardcore fanbase and passion for preaching Christ's salvation through music that's harder than a bag of your Gran's favourite mints. Lead vocalist Seth has been compared a couple of times to Cory Darst (ex-lead vocalist of Zao) in his approach to vocal sound and style, which can never be a bad thing, though when he occasionally speaks during the tracks he can sound a little two dimensional and uninspiring. This is only Mortal Treason's first album (a second is due soon) but their musicianship is already of fantastic standard. Every guitar riff worth bottling and surprising your pastor with on a Sunday morning. My only gripe is of Seth's unimaginative song titles, his lyrics are quite good but he needs some tips from Bloodlined Calligraphy's Ally French on what he calls the tracks. ==Track listing== #"Khampa Nomads" – 5:33 #"Walk Thru the Woods" – 5:59 #"War Within" – 3:45 #"A Call to the Martyrs" – 3:09 #"Feed on the Weak" – 4:56 #"Bride's Last Kiss" – 4:18 #"Beneath the Shadows" – 3:13 #"Todd" – 6:14 #Hidden track – 3:33 ==Personnel== Mortal Treason * Seth Kimbrough – vocals * Josh Jarrett – guitar * Richie Reale – guitar * Alan Sears – bass * Chase Nickens – drums Production * Nathan Dantzler - Engineer, Mastering, Mixing, Producer * Ryan Dominguez - Assistant Engineer * Bob Herdman - Executive Producer * Will McGinniss - Executive Producer * Sam Shifley - Engineer, Producer * Mark Stuart - Executive Producer ==References== Category:Mortal Treason albums Category:2004 debut albums

31831074	A Cambridge Mass	A Cambridge Mass is a choral work in G major by Ralph Vaughan Williams written between 1898 and 1899 as part of his studies in Cambridge for his Doctorate of Music. It is one of two large scale choral works with orchestral accompaniment by Vaughan Williams surviving from this period, the other being a cantata setting of Swinburne's poem The Garden of Proserpine. ==History== ===Composition=== Returning to Cambridge from a period in Berlin taking lessons from Max Bruch, Vaughan Williams was set the task of composing a large scale (40-60 minute) choral/orchestral work containing the following: # Sections for one or more soloists along with major portions for an eight voice choir; # Examples of both canons and fugues; # An orchestral section in sonata form, either as an overture or intermezzo; and # A single section for voice(s) alone, the rest being with full orchestral accompaniment. Vaughan Williams responded with a concert setting of the Credo and Sanctus of the mass in a quasi-symphonic structure with two choral movements with orchestral accompaniment flanking a central movement for orchestra alone. It is not known why Vaughan Williams did not set the complete mass. McClarney in his thesis speculates that it may have either been due to time constraints or personality clashes with his teacher Stanford, citing a letter to Holst in which the composer talks both of a lack of sleep due to time spent writing out the score and of a disagreement with Stanford over the structure of the completed composition. ===Rediscovery=== After being submitted for Vaughan Williams' doctorate, the mass was stored in the university archives until it was put on display in 2007, where it was noticed by conductor Alan Tongue, who recognized its potential significance and obtained permission from the Vaughan Williams Charitable Trust for a performing version to be made from the manuscript score. ===Performance history=== The first performance of the mass took place on 3 March 2011 at the Fairfield Halls in Croydon. Subsequent performances have taken place in Bath and in the United States at Smith College, Northampton. ===Recording=== In October 2014, Albion Records released a recording of the premiere performance of the Mass. ==Movements== The composition is a missa brevis for orchestra, double choir and four soloists, and is divided into three movements: # Credo: Andante Maestoso - Adagio molto - Allegro moderato - Allegro # Offertorium: Allegro moderato # Finale (Sanctus - Benedictus - Hosanna): Adagio - Allegro - Andante sostenuto - Allegro ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * * * * * * ==External links== * * * * * * Stainer & Bell Ralph Vaughan Williams: A Cambridge Mass Category:Compositions by Ralph Vaughan Williams Category:Masses (music) Category:1899 compositions Category:Compositions in G major Vaughan Williams
70140038	A Camel's Kiss	A Camel's Kiss is a solo cello album by Tristan Honsinger. It was recorded in December 1999 at Plantage Doklaan, Amsterdam, and was released by Instant Composers Pool in 2000. When asked about the title of the album, Honsinger replied: "I had an experience with a llama one time. It was tied up outside the City Hall of Marseille and the funny thing was that these business people had to go past the llama to get into the City Hall. They were all dressed with suits and briefcases and they all had to look at the llama and their reactions were – I never laughed so hard in my life. I thought, yeah, it's a little bit like a camel, like kissing a camel." When asked why he didn't name the album A Llama's Kiss, Honsinger responded: "Aahh, because I like the word camel." ==Reception== In a review for AllMusic, Dean McFarlane wrote: "This CD... finds... Honsinger... performing as he does best a style of fractured but highly emotive avant-garde cello. His vocalizing in improvisation is a kind of subconscious moan that is charming and somewhat frightening to hear over the squalls of cello lyricism. He lets the instrument do the talking, in that his vocalizing is vague tonal accompaniment to his virtuoso string flurries. His performance is flippant, but by no stretch is it slapstick; his improvising is highly developed, and... he is captured in crystal-clear fidelity, and his performance is evocative of jazz, classical, folk, and avant-garde idioms, fields that he draws inspiration from then transmutes into his own unique instrumental language... This recording captures all of the evocative emotional weight that a cello recital carries, but is lively and upbeat while simultaneously melancholic and introspective. It is the speed with which the performer can transform from these emotions which highlights his virtuosity on the instrument." The authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz awarded the album 4 stars, calling it "superb," and stating that it "sees Honsinger negotiate the entire range of his musical heritage, from Bach-like solo sonatas to Berliner Ensemble cabaret songs to free-form improvisations which camouflage a strong inner structure. It's a completely exhilarating 50-odd minutes of music, with not a dull spot. It's also beautifully recorded, bringing out the resonant woodiness of the cello, as well as its percussive potential and its ability to set off ringing harmonics in the space around the performer." ==Track listing== All compositions by Tristan Honsinger. # "Squitty Geshee" – 1:58 # "Stopera" – 11:42 # "Mary Contrairy" – 3:00 # "Go East" – 5:03 # "A Camel's Kiss" – 8:48 # "Waves" – 1:20 # "From Time to Time Suite" – 7:33 # "Restless in Pieces" – 12:45 == Personnel == * Tristan Honsinger – cello, voice ==References== Category:Tristan Honsinger albums Category:2000 albums

Barton reviewed A Campaign and Adventure Guidebook for Middle-earth in The Space Gamer No. 57. Barton commented that "Overall, the real usefulness of Middle Earth as a campaign aid will have to wait for subsequent modules in the series to be proven. Unless you're an absolute Tolkien fanatic and don't mind paying [...] you may want to hold off purchasing this one until others in the series are available for evaluation." Jonathan Sutherland reviewed the Guidebook and Gridded Map for White Dwarf #50, giving it an overall rating of 6 out of 10, and stated that "The most useful section contains the trade routes, language areas and climate maps. Altogether, a useful package, if a little expensive, but because of the beautifully reproduced map." ==References== Category:Middle-earth Role Playing supplements Category:Role- playing game supplements introduced in 1982

51864384	A Can of Paint	A Can of Paint is a science fiction short story by Canadian-American writer A. E. van Vogt, originally published in Astounding in 1944. It is a light-hearted look at the first crewed mission to Venus, a "science puzzle" or "problem story" that requires the protagonist to think his way out of a thorny situation. Included in several anthologies, it was also made into a short film in 2004. ==Plot== The protagonist lands on Venus, the first man to successfully make the journey without falling into the Sun. Exiting the ship to begin exploring, he notices a cube-like object with a handle on it just outside the door. He picks it up and it speaks to him through mind telepathy. "I contain paint..." is all he manages to hear before a small amount squirts out onto his shirt and he drops the cube. The paint glows and has all the colors of a rainbow. He soon notices that the paint is spreading, and when he removes his shirt it jumps onto his skin. When he attempts to rub it off, it flows back on. He then attempts to use various chemicals to remove it, using every solvent he can find and even some of his precious rocket fuel. None of these work, so he tries a screw-top container which he uses to scoop it off, locking it within so it cannot flow back. After filling part of a bucket, he notices that there is no less paint on him than before – it appears to be self-repairing. He also notices that he is growing extremely hot, as it is also a powerful insulator. He is bemused by the fact that this paint appears to be perfect; it comes in all colors, applies itself, repairs itself, and insulates as well. Unfortunately that insulation quality will kill him due to overheating, long before the equally worrying possibility of it covering his body completely. Thinking about the problem, he realizes that such a perfect paint had to be manufactured by an advanced technology. He turns on his radio and is quickly contacted by the Venusians. They explain that their bodies are so hideous that they are afraid the sight of them will drive humans mad. They have developed the can of paint with human telepathy at great expense as a sort of IQ test, and that if he lives through the test and is also able to look at them, any following visitor with his IQ or better will be allowed in. After apologizing for all the bother, they disconnect. Careful not to lift the cube again, he places his hand on the handle and it begins "I contain 2/3rds paint... " and then goes on to read out a complete list of ingredients and application instructions. The primary ingredient is liquid light, and the instructions say it can be easily removed by applying darkness paste. Initially finding this amusing because he does not know where the hardware store is, he suddenly realizes he has a solution. The action continues with him on his way back to Earth, talking on the radio to another ship making the journey. He explains that he lined his fuel tank with solar cells, capturing the light given off from the paint while blocking any light from outside falling on it. It eventually ran out of energy and fell off as a powder. He mentions that he is returning with his ship completely filled with cans of this indestructible, self-applying, insulating perfect paint, from which he hopes to make his fortune. ==Publication== The story was first published in Astounding in September 1944, at the height of van Vogt's short-story efforts. It was included in Destination: Universe! in 1952, and in Transfinite: The Essential A.E. van Vogt in 2003. Although it is not as well known as van Vogt's stories like "Far Centaurus", it is widely commented on in off-topic references. Damon Knight's dismissive review of van Vogt's works singles out the story as one to be ridiculed. He notes: The complaint is ironic, given that solar cells were invented less than a decade later, and their first use was for spacecraft. They remain a common fixture of practically every spacecraft to this day. ==Movie== The story was adapted to the screen by Winston Engle, and filmed by director Robi Michael in 2004. The story remains very similar to the original, although the setting is moved from Venus to a derelict spaceship found in deep space. The protagonist, Kilgour (played by Aaron Robson) speaks only to his ship's computer (voiced by Jean Franzblau), but the action remains otherwise faithful to the original. ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== * Category:Science fiction short stories Category:Short stories by A.

The middle-aged woman seems to be partly deaf and anxious about the fast-moving train crashing. She is delighted by a canary she bought in Palermo in Sicily. The train passes a house fire and wrecked vehicles. Halfway through the story, the narrator reveals himself to be the husband, listening in on the woman’s conversation with his wife. After finding out that the couple are American, the woman mentions repeatedly that Americans make the only good husbands. She bought the canary for her still-heartbroken daughter, whom she prevented from marrying a Swiss man in Vevey two years ago. As they exit the train, it is revealed that the American couple will live separately in Paris. ==Development== Hemingway began writing the first drafts of "A Canary for One" in September 1926. ==References== ==External links== * * Full text of "A Canary for One" at HathiTrust Digital Library Category:1927 short stories Category:Short stories by Ernest Hemingway Category:Works originally published in Scribner's Magazine Category:Short stories set on trains Category:Short stories set in France

55626506	A Candle for the Devil	A Candle for the Devil ( Spanish: Una vela para el diablo), also released as It Happened at Nightmare Inn, is a 1973 Spanish horror film directed by Eugenio Martín and starring Aurora Bautista and Judy Geeson. Its plot follows two sisters in Spain, both suffering from extreme repression and religious paranoia, who murder a British guest at their inn just before her sister arrives to meet with her. ==Plot== Middle-aged sisters Marta and Verónica run an inn in a Spanish village for travelers. May, a British guest, sunbathes topless on the terrace, and is confronted by the sisters, whose religious convictions forbid such behavior. The three get into an argument, and May is pushed down a staircase and smashes through a glass window, which slashes her to death. As Marta and Verónica scramble to hide her body, her sister Laura arrives at the inn. Marta tells Laura that May checked out and paid her bill earlier that day. Laura decides to take a room until she can find May. Helen Miller, an indecent woman by the sisters' standards, checks in to the inn the following day, after which Verónica goes to visit Luis, with whom she is having an affair, and the two have sex. After, she confesses to Luis that Marta has discovered money missing, which she had given to Luis. Meanwhile, while strolling, Marta spies on several young men skinny-dipping. Later, when Helen returns to the inn late at night, she gets into an argument with Marta, who has forbidden that guests arrive back later than 11pm. Helen taunts Marta, who then stabs her to death. The next morning, an American woman, Norma, arrives to stay at the inn with her infant child. Bothered by Helen's disappearance, Laura checks out of the inn and goes to stay in a different hotel. She goes to meet with a local police chief to tell him of her suspicions, and he reveals that Marta's fiancé had disappeared on their wedding day years before. Upon returning to the inn later that night after a brief meeting with Laura, Norma finds Marta and Verónica in the kitchen with her baby. Marta chastises Norma for being a single unmarried mother. Marta and Norma begin fighting, and Norma slaps her in the face several times; as Norma attempts to retrieve her baby from Verónica, Marta stabs her in the back, killing her. In Norma's belongings, Verónica discovers a letter from Norma to her husband about their pending divorce, revealing that Norma was in fact married. This leaves Verónica riddled with guilt, but Marta is unmoved. Laura breaks into the inn that night to search for evidence implicating the sisters in the disappearances, and investigates large wine vats in the basement, but flees when the sisters hear her. The next day, Laura returns to the inn with a local man, Eduardo, posing as her husband who has just arrived, and rents a room. Marta is suspicious, believing she has seen the man before in town. Meanwhile, during a meal at the inn's restaurant, a woman falls violently ill with food poisoning; her husband notices an odd piece of meat on her plate, and he wraps it in a napkin to give to police. Late that night, Eduardo goes to investigate the inn's basement. In one of the vats, he finds pieces of flesh and bones floating in red wine, along with Norma's severed head. As he steps away from the vat, Marta stabs him to death. Meanwhile, at the local police station, it is determined that the piece of meat is in fact a chunk of flesh with an eyeball attached; the body part had been stirred up after Laura's earlier attempt to probe the contents of the vats. While the police and a band of villagers head to the inn, Laura goes to search for Eduardo, and finds him dead in the sisters' bedroom. There, she is confronted by the two women, who bind and gag her. Laura flees downstairs with her hands tied, and attempts to find an unlocked door. The sisters corner a helpless Laura against a window. She opens the drapes, however, revealing the police and villagers who witness the scene. ==Cast== ==Release== The film received theatrical distribution via Paramount Pictures in Spain, and was released in the United States under the title It Happened at Nightmare Inn.

63007399	A Candle in Her Room	A Candle in Her Room is a 1966 children's book written by Ruth M. Arthur, illustrated by Margery Gill and published by Atheneum Books. The book - set in Pembrokeshire, Wales - explores the effect of a bewitched doll on multiple generations of young women. ==Summary== A malevolent doll found in the attic of a seaside mansion affects the actions of three generations of young women, until at last one is able to break the spell and destroy it. The book explores the themes of love of family across generations, and good vs. evil. The story is told in four parts, each by a separate narrator as the story moves through time. Part one is told by Melissa, from when the family arrives at the Old Court until she and Judith and Carew were about to become adults, in the middle of World War I. Part two is told by Dilys, Judith's daughter, who has moved back to the Old Court with Judith after Carew's death in the war. Part two ends as Dilys and her love, Bron, are about to go to his home in Poland as World War II is about to start. Part three is told by Melissa again, about a year after Part two ends while she is waiting to hear from Dilys. It ends about 13 years later. Part four is told by Nina, Dilys daughter. ==Plot== Melissa's parents move their family and Emmy Lee to the mansion - called Old Court - in Pembrokeshire. The mansion - formerly a courthouse - passed to Melissa's parents upon the death of Aunt Lucia. Everyone is delighted except Judith, the artist, who wants to remain in London. Briony finds the slim wooden doll with the word 'DIDO' carved down her back, and soon her behavior changes. After Judith discovers it though, it suddenly disappears. The odd behavior changes in Briony that Melissa observed when she had Dido soon went away after she 'lost' her, and Briony returned to her usual self. Judith draws farther away from the family, becoming even more moody and difficult than usual. She stay mostly in London, secretive and detached. Melissa and Carew develop a romantic attachment, but when Carew meets Judith, and says of her 'she has the brilliance of a diamond, and no heart. She fascinates and terrifies me. She has great magnetism and I feel she might compel me to do something against my will, something devilish, something she wanted.' Melissa and Carew continued their relationship, planning to marry when they became of age. Everything changes when Melissa feels compelled to go by the sea after heavy rains, and the ground gives way. Her injuries heal, but the shock and the strange pains she has in her legs keep her paralyzed. Carew is determined to remain faithful to her, but after time passes, when he finishes his studies, Judith sweeps in and the two run off to London together to marry. Melissa, remains in Newcove with Miss Emmy as Part I concludes. Part two is told by Dilys starting when she is six and realizes her mother doesn't love her. She lives at Old Court in Newcove, with Aunt Liss (Melissa), and Emmy, and sometimes her mother Judith is there but she acts strangely much of the time and pushes everyone away. As she grows up, she learns about what happened between her mother, Judith, and Aunt Liss; she also briefly comes in to contact with Dido and is repulsed by her. She and Aunt Liss talk of Dido one day, and Dilys learns how powerful she is. Dilys meets Bron, a Polish man staying in the area. They fall in love and Part II ends after they commit to each other, in 1938. Part three is told from the point of view of Melissa again, and starts with a letter arriving from Dilys seven months after it was sent from Poland, in early 1940. Shortly after a friend of Bron's arrives, and lets them know that Bron (and Dilys) has joined the Polish underground resistance movement. After Judith dies of pneumonia, Melissa and Emmy Lee search everywhere for Dido in order to destroy her, but they can't find it. World War II ends, and Melissa searches endlessly for Dilys, but cannot find her. It occurs to her that perhaps Dilys and Jan had a child. Days later, Melissa has her first vision of a child in the room with her. She starts to see the child regularly, and this gives her new hope. After time she sees the child becoming older. One day during an appearance of the child, the child is actually looking at her. To keep the dog from starting, Melissa nudges the dog with her foot. Suddenly she realizes the child is Dilys daughter, and also that has some chance of movement despite the paralysis. She determined to learn to walk again, so that she could visit every orphanage in Europe if need be to find Dilys daughter. Part four is told by twelve-year-old Nina, Dilys daughter, who has been in an orphanage for two years since her mother - Dilys - had died. Dilys had been not right in her mind after the war, she couldn't go back to Wales, so they had lived in refugee camps after Bron died. Now Aunt Liss has finally come to get her. Nina is dazed at first, walks through the Old Court again in her imagination as she has many times before from her mother's stories of it. Nina and Aunt Liss travel back to the Old Court, and establish new patterns. Nina has her choice of rooms in the house, and chooses Judith's old room in the attic, despite the hostile presence there. Nina feels uncomfortably alienated from Aunt Liss and Miss Emmy at times because of her past, but also tougher than them because of all she had endured. In time she finds Dido, hidden deep within a series of cubby holes, with the herb Santolina/Lavender Cotton packed around her. Nina enters into a relationship with Dido, which the reader experiences for the first time. Nina sees different expressions on Dido's face, and Nina is very aware of Dido's effect on her actions. She tries to resist, but keeps being drawn in to her power. She realizes that it was Dido that made Judith the way she was. When Dido finally threatens Melissa, Nina makes up her mind. She builds a bonfire on the sandy beach and flings Dido in to the center of it. She wins out over the evil in that doll. ==Characters== * Melissa Mansell, oldest of the 3 girls who move to the Old Court before WWI * Judith Mansell, middle sister who becomes controlled by Dido * Briony Mansell, youngest sister who grows up and moves to Canada * Emmy Lee, maid for the Mansell family, lifelong companion to Melissa * Dr. Mansell - father of Melissa, Judith and Briony * Mother Mansell - Dr. Mansell's wife, mother of the 3 girls * Aunt Lucia - Dr. Mansell's aunt who left the 'Old Court' to the Mansell family * Young Rees Owen - local neighbor and handyman * Old Rees Owen - Young Rees' father * Mrs. Owen - Young Rees' mother, is able to talk to the seals and has healing ways about her * Carew Grenville - well-off young man who falls in love with Melissa, but marries Judith * Dilys Grenville - daughter of Carew Grenville and Judith * Bronislav Kostarski - Polish man living near the Old Court for a year in 1937 who marries Dilys * Miranda, Briony's daughter * Dilly Rolska - Dilys Greenville's name in the Polish resistance * Anya - Nina's best friend at the orphanage * Nina Melissa Rolska | Nina Melissa Kostarska | Nina Melissa Greenville - Dilys and Bron's daughter, final owner of Dido * David Lewis - new neighbor of the Grenville's ==Malevolent Doll - Dido== Dido is described in A Candle in Her Room as being very old, 'polished and smooth as a chestnut with the caresses of many hands,' carved out of a very hard wood like holly wood. Her hair and features were carved in great detail, her expression was 'a curious mixture - wise, sly, enigmatic.' When Dido was discovered by Briony, at the bottom of an old leather trunk in the Old Loft of the Old Court, she was dressed in a simple layer. During Judith's relationship with her, she created an extensive wardrobe for her of velvet dresses and beautifully sewn lace undergarments. An artist herself, Judith first drew Dido and then later painted her constantly. In Judith's paintings, Dido was 'in rich clothes of brilliant colors, her black hair piled high on her proud head. The face was arresting, imperious, disdainful, and wicked... It was a fascinating face, but malevolent.' Judith became famous for those paintings. Rose Michael says of the book and Arthur's others, "I never left them open—as though the doll Dido might escape from the pages the same way she’d evaded every other attempt to contain her. Inspiring, I’ve just realised, the first short story I published as a teenager, giving a new meaning to its ‘Exorcism’ title." The doll featured in this novel is ancient and powerful. In Ellen Datlow's article on 'The Most Disturbing Dolls in Literature, this description of Dido by Gemma Files is first in the list. 'Dido, a wooden doll held together with pegs - slim, hard, and totemically simple, her name incised along her spine.. is obviously a witch's fetish... Her purpose is to sow division, to set blood against blood, to create suffering. She is very definitely an instrument of revenge, an object through which some ceaseless fount of malice is able to survive the grave.' Whoever 'possesses' Dido will see expressions in her face, will perceive her as alive, will be compelled to draw her and cloth her. And when she disobeys Dido, she will be punished with horrible nightmares, sleepwalking, and other compulsions. Dido exerts such power over her owner that her personality changes and her other relationships are challenged. ==Publication History== First published in 1966 by Atheneum Books in the U.S., and by McClelland & Stewart in Canada, it has had several reprints but is currently out-of-print. It has an alternate title of The Witch Doll. 1966 - London - Gollancz - Juvenile Audience 1966 - New York - Atheneum 1966 - New York - Atheneum - Juvenile Audience 1968 - London - Gollancz 1970 - London - May Fair Books 1972 - London - G.

A Candle in Her Room is reported as memorably frightening. In the New Yorker, Cynthia Zarin opens a book review by writing, "Two books have haunted me since childhood... For years, I forgot I had read these books (A Candle and Her Room, and We Have Always Lived in the Castle by Shirley Jackson), as one might suppress a traumatic event, but later, when I happened on them again, one after the other, I realized that here, like sugar laced with rat poison, was the source of the feeling of unease, a ripple below the skin, that rarely deserts me". Lucy Ellmann lists the novel as one of her favorite childhood books, "This was my first taste of a multiple-voice narrative, and I thought it incredibly sophisticated. Moving, too." ==See also== == References == == External links == *Worldcat *Publication history *Goodreads.com *The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction *ISF DB *Open Library *Books Together (Blog) *Old Children's Books - Doll list, Part I *Jen Robinson's Book Page, 2/10/10 Category:British young adult novels Category:1966 British novels Category:Witchcraft in written fiction Category:Novels set in Wales Category:Atheneum Books books Category:Children's books set in Wales
47515595	A Canine Sherlock Holmes	A Canine Sherlock Holmes is a 1912 English silent short film crime drama directed by Stuart Kinder and produced and released by Charles Urban Trading Company. The film starred a canine film actor called Spot, the Urbanora dog. ==The Director== There is almost no information on the director of the film, Stuart Kinder. He began directing in 1911 and did some screen writing as well. A query on findagrave lists two people with the name Stuart Kinder, an American baby born and died in 1923 and a British Sgt. Stuart Whitehead Kinder who was killed in Belgium in 1915 during WW1. The latter Kinder is suspected of being the director Kinder who speculatively went off and joined the war effort. Director Kinder's IMDb filmography ends about the time Sgt Kinder is killed at Belgium with one film remaining for release in 1916. Sgt Kinder was 27 years old at his death which gives him a birth year of around 1887 or 1888.Stuart Kinder, two person; findagrave.com ==Cast== *Spot, The Urbanora Dog ==References== ==External links== *A Canine Sherlock Holmes at IMDb.com *lobby poster Category:1912 films Category:British silent short films Category:Lost British films Category:Sherlock Holmes films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British crime drama films Category:1910s crime drama films Category:1912 lost films Category:1912 drama films Category:1910s British films Category:Silent crime drama films Category:Silent mystery films Category:Silent thriller films
167303	A Canterbury Tale	A Canterbury Tale is a 1944 British film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger starring Eric Portman, Sheila Sim, Dennis Price and Sgt. John Sweet; Esmond Knight provided narration and played two small roles. For the post-war American release, Raymond Massey narrated and Kim Hunter was added to the film. The film was made in black and white, and was the first of two collaborations between Powell and Pressburger and cinematographer Erwin Hillier. Much of the film's visual style is a mixture of British realism and Hillier's German Expressionist style that is harnessed through a neo-romantic sense of the English landscape. The concept that 'the past always haunts the present' in the English landscape was already part of English literary culture, e.g. in works by Rudyard Kipling such as Puck of Pook's Hill, and would become a notable trope for British novelists and film-makers from the 1960s. A Canterbury Tale takes its title from the 14th-century The Canterbury Tales of Geoffrey Chaucer and loosely uses Chaucer's theme of "eccentric characters on a religious pilgrimage" to highlight the wartime experiences of the citizens of Kent and encourage wartime Anglo-American friendship and understanding. Anglo-American relations were also explored in Powell and Pressburger's previous film The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp and in more detail in their subsequent film A Matter of Life and Death. ==Plot== The story concerns three young people: British Army Sergeant Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price), U.S. Army Sergeant Bob Johnson (played by real-life Sergeant John Sweet), and a "Land Girl", Miss Alison Smith (Sheila Sim). The group arrive at the railway station in the fictitious small Kent town of Chillingbourne (filmed in Chilham, Fordwich, Wickhambreaux and other villages in the area), near Canterbury, late on Friday night, 27 August 1943. Peter has been stationed at a nearby Army camp, Alison is due to start working on a farm in the area, and Bob left the train by mistake, hearing the announcement "next stop Canterbury" and thinking he was in Canterbury. As they leave the station together Alison is attacked by an assailant in uniform, who pours glue on her hair before escaping. It transpires that this has happened to other women, and the mystery attacker is known locally as "the glue man". Alison asks Bob if he will spend the weekend in Chillingbourne to help her solve the mystery. The next day, while riding a farm cart in the countryside, Alison meets Peter, who surrounds her cart with his platoon of three Bren Gun Carriers. Alison agrees to meet Peter again. The three decide to investigate the attack, enlisting the help of the locals, including several small boys who play large-scale war games. The three use their detective skills to identify the culprit as a local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman), a gentleman farmer and pillar of the community, who also gives local history lectures to soldiers stationed in the district. Alison interviews all the glue man's victims to identify the dates and times of their attacks. Gibbs visits Colpeper at his home and steals the fire watch roster listing the nights Colpeper was on duty in the town hall, whilst a paper drive for salvage by Johnson's boy commandos lets Johnson discover receipts for gum used to make glue sold to Colpeper. The dates of the attacks correspond with Colpeper's night watches, for which he wore a Home Guard uniform kept in the town hall. On their train journey to Canterbury on the Monday morning, Colpeper joins the three in their compartment. They confront him with their suspicions, which he does not deny, and they discover that his motive is to prevent the soldiers from being distracted from his lectures by female company, as well as to help keep the local women faithful to their absent British boyfriends. In Colpeper's words, Chaucer's pilgrims travelled to Canterbury to "receive a blessing or to do penance". On arriving in the city of Canterbury, devastated by wartime bombing, all three young people receive blessings of their own. Alison discovers that her boyfriend, believed killed in the war, has survived after all; his father, who had blocked their marriage because he thought his son could do better than a shopgirl, finally relents. Bob receives long-delayed letters from his sweetheart, who is now a WAC in Australia. Peter, a cinema organist before the war, gets to play the music of Johann Sebastian Bach on the large organ at Canterbury Cathedral, before leaving with his unit. He decides not to report Colpeper to the Canterbury police, as he had planned to do. ==Cast== * Eric Portman as Thomas Colpeper, a gentleman farmer and magistrate in Chillingbourne. He is a bachelor, living with his mother and, being very keen on the local history of the area, wants to share that knowledge with everyone around him, particularly with the soldiers from elsewhere in Britain who have been billeted nearby. * Sgt. John Sweet, U.S. Army as Acting Sgt. Bob Johnson, ASN 31036062, hails from Three Sisters Falls, Oregon. On his way from Salisbury to Canterbury to meet his friend and fulfil a promise to his mother to see Canterbury Cathedral, he gets off the train at Chillingbourne (filmed at Selling railway station between Faversham and Canterbury) by mistake and almost immediately gets caught up in the mystery of the "glue man". He has come to Britain as a part of the American Army preparing for the invasion of Europe. He becomes more and more willing to learn something about England during his visit. The original script mentioned that Johnson was on his way to Canterbury as his ancestors had come from there. The producers had originally planned to use Burgess Meredith in the role but changed their mind in favour of an unknown. Meredith acted as a script editor for Johnson's character. * Dennis Price as Sgt Peter Gibbs, a cinema organist from London. He has been conscripted into the British Army and has just been stationed at the military camp outside Chillingbourne, where his unit is engaged in training manoeuvres. * Sheila Sim as Alison Smith, a shop assistant in a department store in London. She has joined the Women's Land Army to "do her bit" to help in the defence of her country. She has been assigned to the farm of Thomas Colpeper, the local JP in Chillingbourne. Alison had previously spent a happy summer just outside Chillingbourne, living in a caravan with her fiancé, an archaeologist who has since joined the RAF and is missing in action at the outset of the film. (He is reported at the end as alive and in Gibraltar). Alison is determined to solve the mystery of the "glue man" and seeks the help of Bob Johnson to do so. Johnson replies "You need about as much help as a Flying Fortress". * Charles Hawtrey as Thomas Duckett, the town's stationmaster. * Esmond Knight as Narrator/Seven-Sisters Soldier/Village Idiot. The Narrator reads the modernised extract from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, followed by a piece in Chaucerian style on the changes to Kent since Chaucer's time (both only in the original version). * George Merritt as Ned Horton and Edward Rigby as Jim Horton, play the blacksmith and the wheelwright. The real Horton brothers, Ben and Neville, are seen acting as assistants to the actors. * Hay Petrie as Woodcock. * Freda Jackson as Mrs Prudence Honeywood, the farming woman who employs Alison. * Eliot Makeham as the church organist in Canterbury. * Betty Jardine as Fee Baker. * Harvey Golden as Sgt Roczinsky, Bob Johnson's friend in Canterbury. * Leonard Smith (Leslie) James Tamsitt (Terry) and David Todd (David), play among the group of boys enjoying an adventure and river battle in a bucolic setting. All of them were local to the Canterbury area. Smith, Tamsitt and Todd were selected for speaking roles. * Beresford Egan as PC Ovenden. * Antony Holles as Sergt. Bassett. * Maude Lambert as Miss Grainger. * Wally Bosco as ARP man. * Charles Paton as Ernie Brooks. * Jane Millican as Susanna Foster. * John Slater as Sergt. Len. * Michael Golden as Sergt. Smale. * Graham Moffatt as Sergt. 'Stuffy'. * Mary Line as Leslie's mother. * Winifred Swaffer as Mrs Horton. * Michael Howard as Archie. * Judith Furse as Dorothy Bird. * Barbara Waring as Polly Finn. * Jean Shepeard as Gwladys Swinton. * Margaret Scudamore as Mrs Colpeper. * Joss Ambler as Police Inspector. * Jessie James as Waitress. * Kathleen Lucas as a passer- by. * HF Maltby as Mr Portal. * Eric Maturin as Geoffrey's father. * Parry Jones jnr as Arthur * Kim Hunter as Johnson's Girl (American release). * Raymond Massey as Narrator (American version) (voice). *Esma Cannon as Agnes the maid ==Production== ===Writing=== Powell and Pressburger, who were known collectivity as "The Archers", wrote the script together, linking the concepts of landscape and history (light and time) with the personal journey of three people—the pilgrims—to show a basis of common identity. Powell was said to have used the work of Chaucer as inspiration to create a film that showed "the love of his birthplace and all that he felt about England". ===Casting=== All three leads were unknowns. Many local people, including a lot of young boys, were recruited as extras for the extensive scenes of children's outdoor activities such as river "battles" and dens. ===Filming=== The film was shot throughout the county of Kent not long after the Baedeker raids of May–June 1942 which had destroyed large areas of the city centre of Canterbury. Much of the film is shot on location in and around Canterbury Cathedral and the city's bomb sites, including the High Street, Rose Lane and the Buttermarket. The cathedral was not available for filming as the stained glass had been taken down, the windows boarded up and the organ, an important location for the story, removed to storage, all for protection against air raids. By the use of clever perspective, large portions of the cathedral were recreated within the studio by art director Alfred Junge. Several Kent villages including Chilham, Wickhambreaux, Fordwich and Wingham were used for scenes showing the fictional village of Chillingbourne. Selling Station appears in the film as Chillingbourne Station at the beginning of the film. Chilham Mill features in the film in the scene where GI Bob meets children playing in the river on a boat and later, with Peter, when they get the proof about Colpeper. The scene where soldiers gather for a lecture at the Colpepper Institute was filmed in Fordwich. As Bob and Alison ride on a cart through the village, Wickham Mill, Wickhambreaux, can be clearly seen. Colpeper's house was Wickhambreaux Court. A local Wingham village pub "The Red Lion" was used for some exterior shots of "The Hand of Glory" inn where Bob stays whilst in the village. Other exterior shots of "The Hand of Glory" were filmed at "The George and Dragon", Fordwich. Before the credits, the following acknowledgement appears over an image of the cathedral viewed from the Christ Church Gate, ==Soundtrack== Besides that composed by Allan Gray for the film, musical works featured include: * Angelus ad Virginem mid-15th century polyphony heard as a peal of bells in orchestral guise under the opening titles * Commando Patrol by Allan Gray, Stan Bowsher, Walter Ridley – quickstep heard in the background during Johnson and Gibbs's scene in the lobby of the Hand of Glory * I See You Everywhere by Allan Gray, Stan Bowsher, Walter Ridley – slow foxtrot heard in the background during Johnson and Gibbs's scene in the lobby of the Hand of Glory * Turkey in the Straw – folksong heard as Agnes leaves Bob's bedroom * Come to the Church in the Wild Wood – Bob sings as he washes * Hear my prayer, O Lord by Henry Purcell – the ethereal choral music heard as Gibbs pauses on entering the cathedral * Bond of Friendship – Regimental March of the King's Division. Played as the band nears the Cathedral * Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565 by J. S. Bach (the original while inside the cathedral and the orchestration by Leopold Stokowski outside the cathedral) and the hymn Onward Christian Soldiers – played on the organ by Gibbs ==Reception== The world premiere was held on 11 May 1944 at the Friars' Cinema (later the second site of the Marlowe Theatre, now demolished), Canterbury, England, an event commemorated there by a plaque unveiled by stars Sheila Sim and John Sweet in October 2000. Although the film initially had very poor reviews in the UK press, and only small audiences, the film became a moderate success at the British box office in 1944.Murphy, Robert (2003_ Realism and Tinsel: Cinema and Society in Britain 1939-48 p.207 The film was the first production of Powell and Pressburger not to be a major box office draw.Tritton, Paul. A Canterbury Tale – Memories of a Classic Wartime Movie . Canterbury: Tritton Publications, August 2000. . With the war over Powell was forced by the studio to completely re-edit the film for the U.S. release, cutting over 20 minutes to make the film shorter and faster moving, adding narration by Raymond Massey, and filming "bookends" which introduced Kim Hunter as Sergeant Johnson's girlfriend to make the film more contemporary. At the time of filming, Hunter and Massey were preparing to film A Matter of Life and Death for Powell. Powell filmed Hunter's sequences with Sweet on an English set simulating New York City where the couple, now married, presented the film as a flashback similar to the openings of The Way to the Stars and 12 O'Clock High. Sweet was actually filmed in New York with the sequences combined. The film was fully restored by the British Film Institute in the late 1970s and the new print was hailed as a masterwork of British cinema. It has since been reissued on DVD in both the UK and USA. ==Legacy== There is now an annual festival based around the film in which film fans tour the film's locations. The theme of the film was used by Spike Milligan for the Goon Show The Phantom Head Shaver of Brighton in 1954. The film was shown in the nave of Canterbury Cathedral on 19 September 2007 to help raise money for the cathedral restoration fund.BBC Kent In May 2014 the film was shown in Chilham village hall to help raise money for the restoration of its war memorial. The screening, which took place in the village where the film was made, coincided with the 70th anniversary of the film's première in Canterbury. Several video artists have recut the more visionary sections of the film as video art. Dialogue from the film was sampled on the track "Introduction" on the album Merrie Land and Dreadzone's Second Light. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * . * . * . ==External links== * * * * * Reviews and articles at the Powell & Pressburger Pages * A Tribute: A Canterbury Tale an essay by Peter von Bagh at the Criterion Collection * Scorsese and Schoonmaker talk about A Canterbury Tale * A screening of A Canterbury Tale in Canterbury cathedral Category:1944 films Category:1940s road comedy-drama films Category:British black-and-white films Category:British road comedy-drama films Category:Films shot at Denham Film Studios Category:Eagle-Lion Films films Category:1940s English-language films Category:Films by Powell and Pressburger Category:Films set in 1943 Category:Films set in Kent Category:Films shot in Kent Category:World War II films made in wartime Category:1944 comedy films Category:1944 drama films Category:1940s British films
35578102	A Canterlot Wedding	"A Canterlot Wedding" is the title of the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth episodes of the second season of the animated television series My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic. The fifty-first and fifty-second episodes overall, they were directed by James Wootton and written by Meghan McCarthy. "A Canterlot Wedding" premiered as an hour-long event on The Hub on April 21, 2012. Twilight Sparkle (Tara Strong) learns her brother, Shining Armor (Andrew Francis), will be marrying Princess Cadance (Britt McKillip). The news excites Twilight but she becomes concerned about the marriage when she notices Cadance is not behaving like the friendly, caring individual she remembers her to be. "A Canterlot Wedding" was series developer Lauren Faust's final involvement in the show. The episodes are a direct reference to the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. They deal with themes that have been considered serious and complex for a children's television series; scholars believe that they involve feminism-related themes. Before the premiere of "A Canterlot Wedding", The Hub began a major marketing campaign that included interactive content on the network's website, promotional events, and a print advertisement in The New York Times in the form of a ceremonial wedding announcement. The episodes' debuts attracted almost one million combined viewers, and critics praised their ambition, music, and visual sequences. == Plot == Twilight Sparkle is surprised to learn her older brother, Captain of the Royal Guard Shining Armor, is to be married. Princess Celestia, her mentor and the ruler of Equestria, has asked Twilight and her friends from Ponyville to help organize the ceremony. Twilight is resentful, as she had only learned of the marriage at this late date and received a letter instead of a visit. When at Canterlot, she finds security has been increased; a magic shield-shell cast by Shining Armor protects the entire city from an unknown threat. Twilight berates her brother; he apologizes and asks Twilight to be his "best mare", to her delight. Shining Armor reveals he is marrying her "foalsitter" Princess Cadance, further cheering up Twilight. She meets a cold and distant Cadance who has no memory of a special rhyme they used to share. During the wedding preparations, Twilight further distrusts Cadance, as she criticizes every aspect of her friends' planning. As pressure from the ceremony mounts, Twilight's friends dismiss her claims about Cadance's poor behavior, saying Cadence is just stressed. Twilight approaches Shining Armor with her concerns, but Cadance takes him aside, casting a seemingly evil spell upon him. The next day, at a wedding rehearsal, Twilight decries Cadance as evil, causing Cadence to run off in tears. A furious Shining Armor explains that Cadance is being rude due to pressure from the wedding planning and the spell she cast on him was meant to help him deal with the migraines caused by the casting of the shield. He dismisses Twilight as his best mare, claiming she shouldn't come to the wedding at all, and he, Celestia and Twilight's friends, who also refuse to believe her, leave her alone to go check on Cadence, who arrives to comfort Twilight. When Twilight tries to apologize, Cadance transports her beneath Canterlot. Twilight is in the long-forgotten crystal caves beneath Canterlot. An image of Cadance taunts her, saying the marriage will continue without Twilight's interference. Twilight shatters a crystal wall; she finds disheveled Cadance. Enraged, Twilight attacks the second Cadance, who proves herself to be the real Cadance by reciting the shared rhyme from their youth. Cadance explains she was abducted by an impostor who wants to marry Shining Armor. Twilight and Cadance escape to stop the wedding. Meanwhile, the fake Cadance plots against Shining Armor and the others. Just before the ceremony is completed, Twilight and the real Cadance expose the deception. Enraged, the fake Cadance reveals her true image as Queen Chrysalis, ruler of the shape- shifting, insect-like Changelings who feed on love. Queen Chrysalis has been usurping Shining Armor's power, weakening the shield to allow her Changeling army to invade Canterlot and take over Equestria. Celestia, who is overpowered by Chrysalis, implores Twilight and her friends to retrieve the Elements of Harmony to stop the Changelings. However, they are returned to Chrysalis. As the queen celebrates her victory, Twilight frees Cadance, who frees Shining Armor from Chrysalis's spell. He recasts the shield, expelling Chrysalis and her army from Canterlot. Celestia commends Twilight's conviction that ultimately saved the day. The real wedding goes ahead as planned; Twilight, who again becomes best mare, eagerly oversees preparations for a much more appreciative Cadance. After the wedding ceremony, a celebration with Twilight as the wedding singer ensues. == Production and promotion == "A Canterlot Wedding" was series developer Lauren Faust's final involvement with the show. Faust had served as executive producer during season one and as consulting producer during season two. The episodes are a direct reference to the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. Queen Chrysalis was designed by Rebecca Dart from DHX Media: the character was envisioned as damp, hunched over, weak, and rotten-looking; and "like she crawled out from under a log". Hasbro felt that Dart's design was not intimidating enough, so Dart gave her an upright stance to appear more commanding. To give Queen Chrysalis an insect-like appearance, holes are abundant in the character's design. Her decaying aspects are deliberate contrasts to the vigor of Princess Celestia and Cadance. Shining Armor and Cadance are intended to display strength, honor, and fearlessness. An advertisement formally announcing the marriage of Princess Cadance and Shining Armor was placed in The New York Times wedding section on April 13, 2012, and McCarthy said the advertisement was placed because the channel wanted to "justify something big and crazy and exciting". Actor and wedding aficionado Tori Spelling appeared at promotional events for "A Canterlot Wedding" and in segments aired on The Hub during the episodes. Spelling, who was scheduled to host a "bridle shower" event in Culver City the week before the episodes' airing, canceled due to pregnancy sicknesses and television personality Brooke Burke took her place. == Themes == The episodes have been subject to feminist analysis. In a chapter of Orienting Feminism, Kevin Fletcher said the episodes both exemplify and resist "princess culture", and suggested they undermine the typical fairy-tale wedding by focusing on Twilight and her friends rather than the royal couple. He stated that Chrysalis's "disordered female behaviour", perceived to be similar to that of evil Disney queens, lends itself to retrogressive interpretations. According to academic and feminist Joanna Russ, matriarchal societies in science fiction are frequently modeled after termites. Fletcher asserted that the function of "A Canterlot Wedding" as retrogressive episodes is enhanced by these components. He believed creators were aware of the post-feminist concept of "having it all"—a rhetoric spawned by post-feminist texts that portray work and social connection as binary options—with the reprise of "This Day Aria" showcasing this awareness. The post-feminist agenda of "having it all", according to Fletcher, is thus deemed harmful since it is linked to an evil queen figure. A study by Christian Valiente and Xeno Rasmusson found the episodes challenge gender stereotypes; females drive the action and dialogue while males are either incompetent or under female control. Females are also in positions of authority, and in primary and active roles. == Broadcast and reception == === Ratings === Both parts of "A Canterlot Wedding" premiered on The Hub in the United States on April 21, 2012. Several sources noted their broadcast was close to the first anniversary of the marriage of Prince William and Catherine Middleton. According to Hasbro, the episodes became rating successes. The first part received a viewership of 483,000, over 300% higher than the ratings of the previous year. The second was watched by 475,000 people, and received a 157% increase in viewership. === Responses === "A Canterlot Wedding" received positive reviews. Emily St. James gave the double episode an "A−" rating, considering it to be a reason why she felt Friendship Is Magic was one of the best children's programs. Articles in the New York Daily News and Entertainment Weekly described the episodes as "charming and surprisingly complex" and "ambitious, absorbing, and thoroughly entertaining". Journalists have praised "A Canterlot Wedding"s themes, describing them as serious, complex, and mature for a children's television series. Common Sense Media writer Emily Ashby called the episodes "an illustrator of life lessons that have value for kids of all ages". According to Shaun Scotellaro, founder of fan site Equestria Daily, Cadance was initially criticized by Friendship Is Magic fans for being a "pretty pink alicorn princess"—which was "the exact opposite of what we wanted"—but in the end the show's fans enjoyed the episode, and Scotellaro described it as "perfect". St. James and Sherilyn Connelly of SF Weekly called the music "one of the best things about this show" and "just breathtaking", respectively. Reviewers often singled out "This Day Aria" for particular acclaim. Connelly considered it to be showstopping, and approvingly likened it to "La Resistance" from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut and "Walk Through the Fire" from Buffy the Vampire Slayer. St. James favorably compared it to the Disney villain songs; similarly, Comic Book Resources Hannah Grimes cited the song's resemblance to Disney musical numbers, stating it "easily takes the cake as the best song in the entire [of Friendship Is Magic]. ... [I]t's on another level compared to the music in the rest of the series." Critics also praised the episodes' visual sequences. St. James complimented the way "the bright colors and beautiful backgrounds contrast nicely with the more simplistic Flash animation that drives the program". Multiple writers enjoyed the fight between the ponies and the Changelings: Connelly found it thrilling, especially Pinkie Pie's use of Twilight as a gun; and St. James considered it to be vibrant and pleasurable. Other sequences singled out by critics include the "bouncy and fun, filled with real joy and heart" wedding; the climax in which Cadance and Shining Armour defeat the Changelings that "gets [Connelly] gooey inside every time"; and the scene in which Cadance transports Twilight to the caves, which Connelly described as "the most disturbing the show has yet produced". == Home media release == On August 7, 2012, Shout!

195945	A Canticle for Leibowitz	A Canticle for Leibowitz is a post-apocalyptic social science fiction novel by American writer Walter M. Miller Jr., first published in 1959. Set in a Catholic monastery in the desert of the southwestern United States after a devastating nuclear war, the book spans thousands of years as civilization rebuilds itself. The monks of the Albertian Order of Leibowitz preserve the surviving remnants of man's scientific knowledge until the world is again ready for it. The novel is a fix-up of three short stories Miller published in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction that were inspired by the author's participation in the bombing of the monastery at the Battle of Monte Cassino during World War II. The book is considered one of the classics of science fiction and has never been out of print. Appealing to mainstream and genre critics and readers alike, it won the 1961 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel, and its themes of religion, recurrence, and church versus state have generated a significant body of scholarly research. A sequel, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, was published posthumously in 1997. ==Publication history== ===Development=== By 1955, Walter M. Miller Jr. had published over 30 science fiction short stories in such magazines as Astounding Science Fiction, Amazing Stories, and Fantastic Adventures. Significant themes of his stories included loss of scientific knowledge or "socio-technological regression and its presumed antithesis, continued technological advance", its preservation through oral transmission, the guardianship of archives by priests, and "that side of [human] behavior which can only be termed religious". These thematic elements, combined with the growing subgenre of the "post-disaster" story and Miller's own experiences during World War II, set the stage for the short story that would become the opening section of A Canticle for Leibowitz."A Canticle for Leibowitz falls into a well-known subgenre of science fiction, the 'post-disaster' story, like John Wyndham's The Chrysalids (1955), Algis Budrys's Some Will Not Die (1961), and many more. The use of nuclear weapons to end World War II naturally set many writers speculating on the possibilities of future war, mutation, and rebirth". During World War II, Miller served as a radioman and tail gunner in a bomber crew that participated in the destruction of the 6th-century Christian monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy, founded by St. Benedict and recognized as the oldest surviving Christian church in the Western world. This experience impressed him enough to write, a decade later, the short story "A Canticle for Leibowitz", about an order of monks whose abbey springs from the destroyed world around it. The story, which would evolve into "Fiat Homo", the first of three parts of the fix-up novel, was published in the April 1955 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (F&SF;). Although not originally intended as a serialization, the saga continued in "And the Light Is Risen", which was published in August 1956 (also in F&SF;). That work would later grow into "Fiat Lux", the second part of the novel. It was while writing the third story, "The Last Canticle", for magazine publication in February of the following year that Miller realized he was really completing a novel: "Only after I had written the first two and was working on the third did it dawn on me that this isn't three novelettes, it's a novel. And I converted it". The publication of the three "Canticle" stories,ISFDB catalogs them as a novelette and two novellas, which are defined by word counts 7,500–17,500 and 17,500–40,000, respectively; shorter and longer works are short stories and novels. along with Miller's "The Lineman", in F&SF;, marked a significant evolution in the writer's craft. Under the editorship of Anthony Boucher, F&SF; possessed a reputation for publishing works with "careful writing and characterization". Walker Percy considered the magazine "high-class sci-fi pulp". The appearance of these stories in the magazine is indicative of the direction Miller's writing had taken toward human' stories, less crowded with incident, more concerned with values". A Canticle for Leibowitz was the only novel Miller published during his lifetime. For the fix-up, Miller did not just collate the three short stories. He changed the title and the names of some characters, added new characters, changed the nature and prominence of existing characters, and added Latin passages. These revisions affected the religious and recurrence themes of the story, improving it from the magazine version. The Latin phrases in the novel relate to Roman Catholic Church practices, rituals and official communications. Susan Olsen writes that Miller did not include the Latin phrases just to "add dignity" to the work, but to emphasize its religious themes, making it consonant with the tradition of Judeo-Christian writings. Changing the name of the abbot of the first part from "Father Juan" to "Abbot Arkos" strengthened the cyclical/recurrence motif, since the name of the first abbot encountered, "Arkos", begins with the first letter of the Latin alphabet and the name of the last abbot, "Zerchi", begins with the last letter. Miller also expanded certain scenes, increasing their importance: for instance, the initial encounter between Brother Francis and Abbot Arkos in "Fiat Homo" grew from two pages in the short story to eight pages in the novel. Abbot Arkos was shown to possess doubts and uncertainty, unlike the dogmatism of Father Juan. Miller also used the adaptation process to add a significant layer of complexity to the story. Walker Percy recognized this dimension of the novel, which he compared to a "cipher, a coded message, a book in a strange language". David Seed deemed the novel "charged with half- concealed meaning", an intricacy that seems to have been added as Miller was revising the stories for publication as a novel. Decoding messages such as this is an important activity in Miller's works, both in A Canticle for Leibowitz and in his short stories. For example, in the original version of "Fiat Homo", Miller limits his "wordplay" to an explicit symbolism involving the letter "V" and Brother Francis' "Voice/Vocation" during Francis' encounter with the wandering pilgrim. In the novel, however, "Miller reserves such symbolistic cross-references to the more intellectual analysts and builds a comedy of incomprehension around Francis". Miller's extensive experience in writing for science fiction magazines contributed to his achievement with A Canticle for Leibowitz. His strengths were with the medium lengths of the short story, novelette, and short novel, where he effectively combined character, action, and import. The success of this full-length novel rests on its tripartite structure: each section is "short novel size, with counterpoint, motifs, and allusions making up for the lack of more ordinary means of continuity". ===Publication=== A Canticle for Leibowitz was published by J. B. Lippincott & Co. as a hardcover in 1960 with a 1959 copyright, and two reprints appeared within the first year. More than 40 new editions and reprints have appeared for the book, which has never been out of print. It often appears on "best of" lists, and has been recognized three times with Locus Poll Awards for best all-time science fiction novel. ==Plot summary== ===Background=== After 20th-century civilization was destroyed by a global nuclear war, known as the "Flame Deluge", there was a violent backlash against the culture of advanced knowledge and technology that had led to the development of nuclear weapons. During this backlash, called the "Simplification", anyone of learning, and eventually anyone who could even read, was likely to be killed by rampaging mobs, who proudly took on the name of "Simpletons". Illiteracy became almost universal, and books were destroyed en masse. Isaac Edward Leibowitz, a Jewish electrical engineer working for the United States military, survived the war and sought refuge from the mobs of the "Simplification" in the sanctuary of a Cistercian monastery, all the while surreptitiously searching for his wife, from whom he had become separated in the war. Eventually concluding that his wife was dead, he joined the monastery, took holy orders (becoming a priest), and dedicated his life to preserving knowledge by hiding books, smuggling them to safety (known as "booklegging"), memorizing, and copying them. He approached the Church for permission to found a new monastic order dedicated to this purpose. With permission granted, he founded his new order in the desert of the American Southwest, where it became known as the "Albertian Order of Leibowitz". The Order's abbey is located in a remote desert in New Mexico, possibly near the military base where Leibowitz worked before the war, on an old road that may have been "a portion of the shortest route from the Great Salt Lake to Old El Paso". Leibowitz was eventually betrayed and martyred. Later beatified by the Roman Catholic Church, he became a candidate for sainthood. Six hundred years after his death, the abbey still preserves the "Memorabilia", the collected writings and artifacts of 20th-century civilization that survived the Flame Deluge and the Simplification, in the hope that they will help future generations reclaim forgotten science. The story is structured in three parts: "", "", and "". The parts are separated by periods of six centuries each. === ("Let There Be Man")=== In the 26th century, a 17-year-old novice named Brother Francis Gerard of Utah is on a vigil in a New Mexico desert. While searching for a rock to complete a shelter from the desert wolves, Brother Francis encounters a vagrant Wanderer, apparently looking for the abbey, who inscribes Hebrew on a rock that appears to be the perfect fit for the shelter. When Brother Francis picks up the rock, he discovers the entrance to an ancient fallout shelter containing "relics", such as handwritten notes on crumbling memo pads bearing cryptic texts resembling a 20th-century shopping list. He soon realizes that these notes appear to have been written by Leibowitz, his order's founder. The discovery of the ancient documents causes an uproar at the monastery, as the other monks speculate that the relics once belonged to Leibowitz. Brother Francis's account of the Wanderer, who ultimately never turned up at the abbey, is also greatly embellished by the other monks amid rumours that he was an apparition of Leibowitz himself; Francis strenuously denies the embellishments, but equally persistently refuses to deny that the encounter occurred, despite the lack of other witnesses. Abbot Arkos, the head of the monastery, worries that the discovery of so many potentially holy relics in such a short period may cause delays in Leibowitz's canonization process. Francis is banished back to the desert to complete his vigil and defuse the sensationalism. Many years later, the abbey is visited by Monsignors Aguerra (God's Advocate) and Flaught (the Devil's Advocate), the Church's investigators in the case for Leibowitz's sainthood. Leibowitz is eventually canonized as Saint Leibowitz – based partly on the evidence Francis discovered in the shelter – and Brother Francis is sent to New Rome to represent the Order at the canonization Mass. He brings with him the documents found in the shelter, and an illumination of one of the documents on which he has spent years working, as a gift to the Pope. En route, he is robbed by "The Pope's Children" – an ironic name for outcast genetic mutants who are the descendants of fallout victims – and his illumination is taken, though he negotiates with the robbers to keep the original blueprint on which the illuminated copy was based. The robbers believe the gold-inlayed copy is the original and the blueprint the worthless copy. Francis completes the journey to New Rome and is granted an audience with the Pope. Francis presents the Pope with the remaining blueprint, and the Pope comforts Francis with the notion that the fifteen years he spent creating the illumination were not rendered a waste by the theft, but rather were essential in protecting the original relic. The Pope also aids Francis by giving him gold with which to ransom back the illumination; however, Francis is killed during his return trip by the Pope's Children, receiving an arrow between the eyes, just after he spots the approach of the Wanderer in the distance. The Wanderer discovers and buries Francis's body. The narrative then focuses on the buzzards who were denied their meal by the burial; they fly over the Great Plains and find much food near the Red River until a city- state, based in Texarkana, rises. === ("Let There Be Light")=== alt=Map as described in the caption.|thumb|left|North America in 3174, showing Texark territory in yellow. The Texark expansion as described in this story and in Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman is marked in orange. In 3174, the Albertian Order of Saint Leibowitz is still preserving the half-understood knowledge from before the Flame Deluge and the subsequent Age of Simplification. The new Dark Age is ending, however, and a new Renaissance is beginning. Thon Taddeo Pfardentrott, a highly regarded secular scholar, is sent by his cousin Hannegan, Mayor of Texarkana, to the abbey. Thon Taddeo, frequently compared to Galileo, is interested in the Order's preserved collection of Memorabilia. At the abbey, Brother Kornhoer, a talented engineer, has just finished work on a "generator of electrical essences", a treadmill-powered electrical generator that powers an arc lamp. He gives credit for the generator to work done by Thon Taddeo. Arriving at the monastery, Thon Taddeo immediately recognizes the significance of Brother Kornhoer's pioneering work. By studying the Memorabilia, Thon Taddeo makes several major "discoveries", and asks the abbot to allow the Memorabilia to be removed to Texarkana. The Abbot Dom Paulo refuses, offering to allow the Thon to continue his research at the abbey instead. Before departing, the Thon comments that it could take decades to finish analyzing the Memorabilia. The Wanderer, now called Benjamin, has settled down as a hermit within sight of the abbey, and has struck up a relationship with the abbot. Before thon Taddeo departs, Benjamin visits the abbey to meet the thon, to see if he is the long- awaited Messiah. Meanwhile, Hannegan makes an alliance with the kingdom of Laredo and the neighboring, relatively civilized city-states against the threat of attack from nomadic warriors living on the plains. Hannegan, however, is secretly manipulating the regional politics to effectively neutralize all of his enemies, leaving him in control of the entire region. Monsignor Apollo, the papal nuncio to Hannegan's court, sends word to New Rome that Hannegan intends to attack the Empire of Denver next, and that he intends to use the abbey as a base of operations from which to conduct the campaign. For his actions, Apollo is executed, and Hannegan initiates a church schism, declaring loyalty to the Pope to be punishable by death. The Church excommunicates Hannegan. === ("Thy Will Be Done")=== In the year 3781, mankind has emerged into a new technological age, and now possesses nuclear energy and weapons again, as well as starships and extrasolar colonies. Two world superpowers, the Asian Coalition and the Atlantic Confederacy, have been embroiled in a cold war for 50 years. The Leibowitzian Order's mission of preserving the Memorabilia has expanded to the preservation of all knowledge. Rumors that both sides are assembling nuclear weapons in space, and that a nuclear weapon has been detonated, increase public and international tensions. At the abbey, the current abbot, Dom Jethras Zerchi, recommends to New Rome that the Church reactivate the ("Whither wanders the flock, the shepherd is with them"), a contingency plan in the case of another global apocalypse which involves "certain vehicles" the Church has had since 3756. A "nuclear incident" occurs in the Asian Coalition city of Itu Wan: an underground nuclear explosion has destroyed the city, and the Atlantic Confederacy counters by firing a "warning shot" over the South Pacific. Rumors swirl about whether the city's devastation was deliberate or accidental. New Rome tells Zerchi to proceed with , and to plan for departure within three days. He appoints Brother Joshua as mission leader, telling him that the mission is an emergency plan for perpetuating the Church on extrasolar colony planets in the event of a nuclear war on Earth. The Order's Memorabilia will also accompany the mission. That night the Atlantic Confederacy launches an assault against Asian Coalition space platforms. The Asian Coalition responds by using a nuclear weapon against the Confederacy capital city of Texarkana, which kills millions of people. A ten-day cease-fire is issued by the World Court. The Wanderer reappears at the rectory, at the last meal before Brother Joshua and the space-trained monks and priests depart on a secret chartered flight for New Rome, hoping to leave Earth on the starship before the cease-fire ends. During the cease-fire, the abbey offers shelter to refugees fleeing the regions affected by fallout, which results in a battle of wills over the euthanasia of hopelessly irradiated refugees between the abbot and a doctor from a government emergency response camp. The war resumes, and a nuclear explosion occurs near the abbey. Abbot Zerchi tries to flee to safety, bringing with him the abbey's ciborium containing consecrated hosts, but it is too late. He is trapped by the falling walls of the abbey and finds himself lying under tons of rock and bones as the abbey's ancient crypts disgorge their contents. Among them is a skull with an arrow hole in its forehead (presumably that of Brother Francis Gerard from the first section of the book). As he lies dying under the abbey's rubble, Zerchi is startled to encounter Mrs. Grales/Rachel, a tomato peddler and two-headed mutant. However, Mrs. Grales has been rendered unconscious by the explosion, and appears to be dying herself. As Zerchi tries to conditionally baptize Rachel, she refuses, and instead takes the ciborium and administers the Eucharist to him. It is implied that she is, like the Virgin Mary, exempt from original sin. Zerchi soon dies, having witnessed an apparent miracle. After the abbot's death, the scene briefly flashes to Joshua and the crew, who are preparing to launch as the nuclear explosions begin. Joshua, the last crew member to board the starship, knocks the dirt from his sandals (a reference to Matthew 10:14, "If anyone will not welcome you or listen to your words, leave that home or town and shake the dust off your feet"), murmuring "" ("Thus passes the world", a play on the phrase , "thus passes the glory of the world"). As a coda, a final vignette depicts the ecological aspects of the war: seabirds and fish succumb to the poisonous fallout, and a shark evades death only by moving to particularly deep water, where, it is noted, the shark was "very hungry that season". ==Major themes== ===Recurrence and cyclical history=== Scholars and critics have noted the theme of cyclic history or recurrence in Miller's works, epitomized in A Canticle for Leibowitz. David Seed, in discussing the treatment of nuclear holocaust in science fiction in his book American Science Fiction and the Cold War: Literature and Film (1992), states, "it was left to Walter M. Miller's A Canticle for Leibowitz to show recurrence taking place in a narrative spanning centuries". David N. Samuelson, whose 1969 doctoral dissertation is considered the "best overall discussion" of the book, calls the "cyclical theme of technological progress and regress ... the foundation- stone on which A Canticle for Leibowitz is built". The story's circular structure – and the cyclical history it presents – support a number of thematic and structural elements which unify its three sections. Although the novel's events take place in a fictional future, the three parts allegorically represent crucial phases of Western history. The first section, "Fiat Homo", depicts a Church preserving civilization, a counterpart to the "Age of Faith" after the Fall of Rome. The action of the second part, "Fiat Lux", focuses on a renaissance of "secular learning", echoing the "divergences of Church and State and of science and faith". "Fiat Voluntas Tua", the final part, is the analog of contemporary civilization, with its "technological marvels, its obsessions with material, worldly power, and its accelerating neglect of faith and the spirit". In her analysis of Miller's fiction, Rose Secrest connects this theme directly to one of Miller's earlier short fiction works, quoting a passage from "The Ties that Bind", published in the May 1954 edition of If magazine: "All societies go through three phases.... First there is the struggle to integrate in a hostile environment. Then, after integration, comes an explosive expansion of the culture-conquest.... Then a withering of the mother culture, and the rebellious rise of young cultures". ===Church versus state=== The third part, "Fiat Voluntas Tua", includes a debate between future Church and state stances on abortion and euthanasia, a thematic issue representative of the larger conflict between Church and state. Literary critic Edward Ducharme claimed that "Miller's narrative continually returns to the conflicts between the scientist's search for truth and the state's power". ==Literary significance and reception== Initial response to the novel was mixed, but it drew responses from newspapers and magazines normally inattentive to science fiction. A Canticle for Leibowitz was reviewed in such notable publications as Time, The New Yorker, The New York Times Book Review, and The Spectator. While The New Yorker was negative – calling Miller a "dull, ashy writer guilty of heavy-weight irony" – The Spectator's was mixed. Also unimpressed, Time said, "Miller proves himself chillingly effective at communicating a kind of post-human lunar landscape of disaster", but dubbed it intellectually lightweight. The New York Times Book Reviews Martin Levin, however, hailed the work as an "ingenious fantasy". The Chicago Tribune gave the book unusual exposure outside the genre in a front-page review in the Chicago Tribune Magazine of Books, reviewer Edmund Fuller calling the book "an extraordinary novel". Rating it five stars out of five, Floyd C. Gale of Galaxy Science Fiction said that "It has many passages of remarkable power and deserves the widest possible audience"."Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf", Galaxy Science Fiction, February 1961, p.139 A decade later, Time re-characterized its opinion of the book, calling it "an extraordinary novel even by literary standards, [which] has flourished by word of mouth for a dozen years". After criticizing unrealistic science fiction, Carl Sagan in 1978 listed A Canticle for Leibowitz as among stories "that are so tautly constructed, so rich in the accommodating details of an unfamiliar society that they sweep me along before I have even a chance to be critical". A Canticle for Leibowitz was an early example of a genre story becoming a mainstream best-seller after large publishers entered the science-fiction market. In 1961 it was awarded the Hugo Award for Best Novel by The World Science Fiction Convention. In the years since, praise for the work has been consistently high. It is considered a "science-fiction classic ... [and] is arguably the best novel written about nuclear apocalypse, surpassing more popularly known books like On the Beach". The book has also generated a significant body of literary criticism, including numerous literature journal articles, books and college courses. Acknowledging its serialization roots, literary critic David N. Samuelson writes that the novel "may be the one universally acknowledged literary masterpiece to emerge from magazine SF". Fellow critic David Cowart places the novel in the realm of works by Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene, and Walker Percy, in 1975 stating it "stands for many readers as the best novel ever written in the genre". Percy, a National Book Award recipient, declared the book "a mystery: it's as if everything came together by some felicitous chance, then fell apart into normal negative entropy. I'm as mystified as ever and hold 'Canticle' in even higher esteem". Scholars and critics have explored the many themes encompassed in the novel, frequently focusing on its motifs of religion, recurrence, and church versus state. ==Adaptations== A 15-part full- cast abridged serial of the novel was adapted for radio by John Reeves and broadcast in 1981 by National Public Radio (NPR). Directed by Karl Schmidt, it was produced by him with Marv Nonn. Carol Cowan narrated the production. In 1992, BBC Radio 4 broadcast a 90-minute dramatization of the first two parts, "Fiat Homo" and "Fiat Lux", with Andrew Price as Brother Francis and Michael McKenzie as Dom Paulo. The adaptation was by Donald Campbell and it was directed by Hamish Wilson. A 2012 adaptation of "Fiat Homo, Part One of A Canticle For Leibowitz" read by Nigel Lindsay, abridged by Nick McCarty and produced by Philippa Geering for BBC Radio 4 Extra, was broadcast in five 30-minute parts.BBC Radio 4 Extra - Fiat Homo, Part One Of A Canticle For Leibowitz on the BBC website ==Sequel== Toward the end of his life, Miller wrote another installment of the Abbey of Saint Leibowitz saga, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman. A full-length novel (455 pages) significantly longer than its predecessor, it is set in AD 3254, eighty years after the events of "Fiat Lux" but several centuries before "Fiat Voluntas Tua". Suffering from writer's block and fearful the new work would go unfinished, Miller arranged with author Terry Bisson to complete it. Bisson said all he did was go in and tie up the loose ends Miller had left. The novel tells the story of Brother Blacktooth St. George of the Leibowitzian abbey who, unlike Brother Francis, wants to be released from his holy vows and leave the abbey. In addition to recounting his travels as Cardinal Brownpony's personal secretary, the book describes the political situation in the 33rd century as the Church and the Texark Empire vie for power. Miller died before the novel's publication. Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman has been called "Walter Miller's other novel". Reviewer Steven H. Silver points out that this "is not to say that Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman does not deserve to be read. It is a fantastic novel, only suffering in comparison to Miller's earlier work". ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * * *A Canticle for Leibowitz parts one, two, and three on the Internet Archive Category:1960 American novels Category:1960 science fiction novels Category:1960 speculative fiction novels Category:Abbey of Monte Cassino Category:American Christian novels Category:American post-apocalyptic novels Category:American science fiction novels Category:Battle of Monte Cassino Category:Catholic novels Category:Catholicism in fiction Category:Christian science fiction Category:English-language novels Category:Hugo Award for Best Novel-winning works Category:J.

6913862	A Cantor's Tale	A Cantor's Tale is a 2005 documentary by Erik Greenberg Anjou. The film profiles Jacob Mendelson, a practitioner of Jewish liturgical music (a cantor) who has dedicated his life to preserving the form's traditional vocal stylings. == Plot == Anjou follows Mendelson around Borough Park, his old neighborhood in Brooklyn. Mendelson, who carries a tuning fork with him at all times, is prone to burst into song. During their journey through Borough Park, Anjou finds that the neighborhood has a fair number of bakers with vocal talents as good as their knishes. Mendelson also recalls when cantors were as popular as baseball players. "They had groupies," he tells Anjou, a strong incentive for a chubby teenager in high school. Mendelson's mother, who had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, was almost obsessed that her son become a cantor. The film reveals an interesting link to celebrity on the part of Mendelson's father: the older Mendelson once co-owned a truck with the father of Steven Spielberg. The movie's original title was Chazz'n, after the profiled cantor's sobriquet "Chazzan Jack Mendelson." It has also been titled A Cantor's Story. == Subject == Mendelson grew up in the Borough Park neighborhood of Brooklyn. He was given the Hebrew name Yaakov Ben-Zion, after his grandfather, the rabbi of Newark between the world wars. He has opera and cantorial degrees from Juilliard and Hebrew Union College (HUC) respectively. He has also taught at both HUC and Jewish Theological Seminary. In 1979, he married Fredda M. Rakusin, a fellow Juilliard graduate, cantor, and opera singer. Mendelson was preceded in his profession by a number of relatives, including a paternal uncle, Nathan, who was cantor at Montreal's Shaar Hashamayim for 35 years, an older brother Solomon "Tucky" Mendelson, and other members of the extended Mendelson family. Sol and Jacob were members of Moshe Koussevitzky's children's choir at Beth-El, and both were later presidents of the Cantors Assembly. ==References== ==External links== * Jeanette Catsoulis' review in The New York Times * Category:2005 films Category:Documentary films about Jews and Judaism in the United States Category:Documentary films about singers Category:Films about Orthodox and Hasidic Jews Category:2000s English- language films

2684050	A Canção de Lisboa	A Canção de Lisboa (lit. The Song of Lisbon) is a 1933 Portuguese musical comedy film, directed by José Cottinelli Telmo, and starring Vasco Santana, Beatriz Costa, António Silva, Alfredo Silva, Ana Maria, Artur Rodrigues, Coralia Escobar, Eduardo Fernandes, Elvira Coutinho, Fernanda Campos, Francisco Costa, Henrique Alves, Ivone Fernandes, José Victor, Júlia da Assunção, Manoel de Oliveira, Manuel Santos Carvalho, Maria Albertina, Maria da Luz, Silvestre Alegrim, Sofia Santos, Teresa Gomes and Zizi Cosme. It was the second Portuguese sound feature film (the first was A Severa; a 1931 biopic of the fado singer Maria Severa Onofriana). In fact, A Canção de Lisboa was the first sound feature fully produced in Portugal, in the labs of Lisboa Filme and with Tobis equipment. A Canção de Lisboa premiered at the São Luís Theatre in Lisbon on 7 November 1933, the first in a long line of popular comedies generically referred to as the comédia à portuguesa. Among the team were some of the greatest names of Portuguese culture of the day, such as painter Carlos Botelho (credited as assistant director) and the poet José Gomes Ferreira (editor assistant). The artist Almada Negreiros was the author of both promotional posters. A Canção de Lisboa remains a classic of cinema in Portugal, and several of its lines and songs have entered common parlance. ==Plot== Vasco Leitão (Vasco Santana), a medical student in Lisbon, is supported by a generous allowance from his two rich elderly aunts from Trás- os-Montes, Efigénia and Perpétua (Sofia Santos and Teresa Gomes), whom he had falsely told he had already graduated. In fact, he devotes himself to a bohemian life, preferring the popular fairs and pretty women, especially Alice (Beatriz Costa), a seamstress from the Castelinhos neighbourhood, which rather upsets her ambitious father, Caetano (António Silva), a tailor who is familiar with Vasco's debts. On the same day he fails his final exam, Vasco is surprised by his aunts' announcement that they will visit him in Lisbon to see his practice. Immediately after arriving in Lisbon, the aunts' bags are stolen and the two elderly ladies faint. Vasco sees himself forced to accept Quinquinhas's (Eduardo Fernandes) suggestion to carry the two unconscious aunts in the carriage announcing an upcoming bullfight; when the aunts come to, they are outraged at the means of conveyance and get cross with Vasco. To soothe their indignation, Vasco asks Caetano for help, and he lies to the aunts, telling them their nephew is an excellent, renowned physician. What Vasco does not know is that Caetano's real interest is the old ladies' large inheritance. Vasco and Alice have a falling out during the Midsummer festival. Meanwhile, at the local recreational society, Caetano single-handedly decides on the outcome of the competition to crown "Miss Castelinhos" so that his daughter Alice can win: the ceremony acts as a musical interlude in which Alce performs a song from a revue, "A Agulha e o Dedal" ("The Needle and the Thimble"), for all the inhabitants of the neighbourhood (who attend in spite of the tedious rhetoric of the jury led by Caetano). The aunts start getting suspicious and see through Vasco's lies once he cannot show them his surgery and takes them instead to Lisbon Zoo, where he is mixed-up with the Veterinarian. The aunts are ashamed and stop supporting Vasco, and soon start being courted by Caetano and the local cobbler (Alfredo Silva) in a final attempt to get their inheritance. thumb|right|The wedding Vasco is saved from misery by his good friend Carlos (Manoel de Oliveira), who gets him a job earning his living as a fado singer, turning him into something of a local celebrity. This does not deter him from pursuing a career in medicine, and he finally passes his final examination with flying colours, regaining the favour of his aunts and winning the hand of Alice in marriage. ==Cast== * Vasco Santana as Vasco Leitão * Beatriz Costa as Alice Costa * António Silva as Caetano Costa * Sofia Santos as Efigénia Rocha * Teresa Gomes as Perpétua Rocha * Manoel de Oliveira as Carlos * Alfredo Silva as the Cobbler * Eduardo Fernandes as Quicas * Ana Maria as Maria da Graça, Carlos's girlfriend * Manuel Santos Carvalho as Alexandrino * Silvestre Alegrim as João, waiter ==Popular culture== An expression that found its way into everyday life in Portugal was an annoyed Vasco visiting Lisbon Zoo with his aunts and shouting repeatedly : “There's lot of hats, you fool!"

8563962	A Capital Federal	A Capital Federal is an operetta whose text was written by Brazilian writer Artur Azevedo. It was first published in 1897, the same year of its premiere. Besides being Azevedo's most popular play, it is perhaps the most popular Brazilian play ever and was also the first to be performed outside Brazil. In the operetta, a country landowner and his family arrive in Rio de Janeiro in search of the daughter's fiancé, Gouveia. They are overwhelmed by the city's chaos, its sexual temptations, and its then-current affectation for French culture, and taken advantage of by city residents such as Lola, the Spanish courtesan, and Figueiredo, the procurer. At the end, the family finds Gouveia and returns to their home in Minas Gerais, and the landowner realizes that Brazil's prosperity comes from the honest labor to be found in the country, rather than from city life and frivolity. In 1923, it was made into a film, directed by Luiz de Barros. ==References== ==External links== * A Capital Federal, the book Category:1897 plays Category:Operettas Category:Portuguese- language operas Category:Brazilian silent films Category:Brazilian plays Category:Brazilian plays adapted into films Category:Comedy plays Category:Operas set in Brazil
36350251	A Capitalism for the People	A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity is a non-fiction book by the Italian writer and economist Luigi Zingales, who is known for serving as a Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance at the University of Chicago's Booth School of Business. Zingales also authored the book Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists, released in 2003. In A Capitalism for the People, Zingales writes that he wants to rescue markets and competition from the twin forces that threaten them: over-regulation on the political left and, on the right, a pro-business (as opposed to pro- market) ideology. He sees the great threat to the U.S. economy as being crony capitalism, laying out what he sees as persuasive evidence, and makes suggestions on how to channel populist anger, reverse the movement toward a crony system, reduce the opportunities for rent seeking, and increase the opportunities for competition. He advocates reforms such as greater transparency with economic data as well as with restrictions on lobbying. Zingales has answered questions on A Capitalism for the People during the Business Daily programme on World Service BBC. He has presented the book at the London School of Economics, where he warned that the U.S. economy risks deteriorating into a Berlusconi-style crony-capitalist system—pro-business rather than pro-market, and run by corrupt politicians who are more concerned with lining the pockets of the connected elite than with improving opportunity for the people. The book has received positive reviews from a variety of publications such as EconTalk, Publishers Weekly, and The Sacramento Bee. ==Background and contents== Zingales writes that the U.S. government's role in the economy has risen significantly between 1900 and 2005, with the fraction of GDP controlled by state rising eightfold. He states that big businesses have used this to their advantage. He elaborates the distinction of how polls state that most Americans support a free market system in principle but oppose business cronyism in practice, and he notes that, in U.S. history, democracy preceded industrialization while access to a broad frontier allowed for personal initiative. Thus, he calls for mass populist social agitation to promote serious market competition, advocating reforms such as restraining lobbying. ==Reviews and reception== Economist and EconTalk program host Russ Roberts praised the book as "a really fantastic ride through a whole bunch of economic, philosophical, and ethical issues related to the current state of the economy and how they can become better." He also called it "just a fascinating and educational look at a wide range of issues". Economist Tyler Cowen stated on his website Marginal Revolution that the book "hits all the right notes" and "is clearly written", leading him to agree "with almost all of it." Publishers Weekly stated that Zingales made an "engaging if imprecise argument" that "persuasively demonstrates the urgent need for action." The publication also commented that Zingales' specific reconciliations appeared overly vague, especially compared to his listing of problems with the American economic system. Still, Zingales' "insight that intellectual and economic freedom are intertwined and that business schools and academics can promote the common good" was praised. Ben Boychuk wrote for the Sacramento Bee placing the book on his "good reads" summer list, and he remarked that it should appeal to both Tea Party activists and the Occupy Wall Street movement.Head to Head: Page-turners: What should you be reading this summer? – Head to Head – The Sacramento Bee ==See also== *2012 in literature *Crony capitalism *Saving Capitalism from the Capitalists ==References== ==External links== *Luigi Zingales - Website Category:2012 non-fiction books Category:Books about capitalism Category:Books about economic history Category:Finance books Category:Basic Books books

It was published in the UK by Hodder & Stoughton on 4 April 2019 () . The cover of the UK hardback 1st edition shows a sea shell, likely to be the dye-producing bolinus brandaris, on a purple, perhaps bloodstained, background. The tale is set in November AD 89 on the Capitoline Hill, and includes a death by falling from the Tarpeian Rock, a stinking family of shell-fish boilers who produce the imperial purple dye, the preparations for Domitian's double triumph, family relationships, and augury, while Flavia and her husband are setting up their new household. In an interview with her editor Oliver Johnson, Davis discussed her successful plan to base a series of books on the seven hills of Rome, starting with the Aventine Hill and reaching the Capitoline Hill with this latest book. ==References== Category:Novels set in ancient Rome Category:British historical novels Category:Flavia Albia novels Category:2019 British novels Category:21st-century British novels Category:Hodder & Stoughton books Category:Novels set in the 1st century Category:St. Martin's Press books

1774092	A Cappella (Todd Rundgren album)	A Cappella is a 1985 album by Todd Rundgren. The album is one of Rundgren's most unusual in that every sound is the product of the artist's voice. Rundgren employed overdubbing techniques and an E-mu Emulator (an early sampler), electronically manipulating the sound of his voice to mimic conventional rock instruments, handclaps, and other sounds. This approach to music making was later explored by artists such as Mike Patton and Björk. A Cappella was finished in 1984 and slated for release on Bearsville Records later that year. But with Bearsville's slimming artist roster and lack of successful artists, founder Albert Grossman did not want to risk releasing an album that he felt was too experimental and would not sell, so A Cappella was shelved. According to journalist Barney Hoskyns, Grossman's increasingly fractious relationship with Rundgren also factored into the decision. Bearsville filed for bankruptcy in 1985 and all of its remaining master recordings were either released through Warner Bros. or shelved altogether. Rundgren's Bearsville contract was acquired by Warner Bros. executive Mo Ostin, with Grossman (who died shortly thereafter) retaining ownership of Rundgren's publishing company. A test pressing of A Cappella was copied and bootlegged under the title, "Runt A Cappella" (CATSVILLE TR-084), and may have influenced Warner Bros. to release the album since bootleggers were profiting from it. This same bootleg was also released as a high quality concert recording of an A Cappella live concert, taken from a recording at the Bismark Theater, on October 25, 1985, that was broadcast via the King Biscuit Flower Hour. The packaging of both bootlegs were the same, so it was unknown whether it was the studio LP or live LP until it was played. A Cappella would also be Rundgren's first official album for Warner Bros. Records, following the demise of Bearsville Records, which Warner Bros. distributed. Rhino Records would subsequently acquire the rights to the album for release on CD and for online distribution. Following its release, Rundgren put his solo career on hold and would not release another studio album until 1989. ==Track listing== All songs written by Todd Rundgren, except where indicated. ;Side one #"Blue Orpheus" – 5:02 #"Johnee Jingo" – 3:51 #"Pretending to Care" – 3:40 #"Hodja" – 3:25 #"Lost Horizon" – 4:57 ;Side two #"Something to Fall Back On" – 4:13 #"Miracle in the Bazaar" – 4:12 #"Lockjaw" – 4:01 #"Honest Work" – 2:40 #"Mighty Love" (Joseph B.

59988823	A Caprice	A Caprice is the only known oil painting by English artist Aubrey Beardsley, made c.1894. It has been held by the Tate Gallery since 1923. Unusually, the work is painted with two different images, one on each side of the canvas. The unfinished surreal images both have covert sexual imagery. The painting on the front of the canvas, A Caprice, is believed to have been painted first. It depicts a scene in a theatre. A woman in a black dress with green details is being led by a short black-faced person in a red costume towards an arched doorway opening onto an auditorium. The woman has a white feather in her black hat, and is holding a white muff; her pallid white face is shown in profile, with prominent red lips and cheeks. The painting seems to be inspired by the first of Beardsley's three images depicting "The Comedy-Ballet of Marionnettes, as performed by the troupe of the Theatre-Impossible, posed in three drawings", which were published in the second volume of the avant-garde art journal The Yellow Book in July 1894. In the illustration, drapes hanging in the arched doorway give it a phallic appearance. In the painting, the red- clothed dwarf with black face may represent female genitalia. On the reverse is a painting known as Masked Woman with a White Mouse. The subject, a woman in a black face mask, is similarly wearing a dark dress, and made up with white skin with red lips and a black beauty spot, and black hair. Incongruously, a white mouse is passing on a flat surface before her, as if along the edge of a balcony, but she pays it no attention. The painting occupies the slightly smaller space within the stretcher, which frames the composition. The mouse is commonly interpreted a Freudian symbol for the penis, although some commentators have noted that Freud's psychoanalytical work was not known in London in 1894.

The paintings may be influenced by William Rothenstein, who also contributed to The Yellow Book and with whom Beardsley shared a studio. The paintings may also be influenced by works of Pietro Longhi depicting the Venetian Carnival. Neither painting was finished, and the canvas was abandoned by Beardsley in 1895 and left behind at 114 Cambridge Street, Pimlico, when his lease ended. It was found by the new tenant, Mrs. Pugh, along with many drawings which she destroyed. It was bought by R.A. Walker in 1920; he gave it the title A Caprice, and sold it to the Tate in 1923. ==References== * Aubrey Beardsley, Caprice.

26859770	A Captain's Duty	A Captain's Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALs, and Dangerous Days at Sea is a book by Captain Richard Phillips, the captain of the container ship MV Maersk Alabama when it was hijacked in 2009. It was written with Stephan Talty and published by Hyperion on April 6, 2010 (and on audio by Tantor). It was adapted in a 2013 film, Captain Phillips. The book tells the story of Phillips' capture and hostage-taking by Somali pirates in April 2009. It alternates between his five-day ordeal and the plight of his family in Vermont, watching the drama unfold on cable news. ABC News reported that the publication of his book coincided with a rise in concern about piracy. == Plot == Phillips was a mariner of 30 years' experience when his ship was taken. He took extensive security precautions to keep his crew safe and hidden, leaving himself as the only possible hostage. This led to an ordeal of several days in a lifeboat in the hands of pirates, whom Phillips portrays as alternately conciliatory, vicious, and unfocused. Meanwhile, the U.S. Navy assembled a large task force, and tensions steadily rose, as did Phillips’ fear for his life. The book details Phillips' attempted escape and eventual rescue by U.S. Navy SEALs, and portrays Phillips' wife Andrea as loyal and strong-willed. ==Reception== Publishers Weekly review stated, "Phillips has a sailor's penchant for the dramatic, which he puts to good use alternating between his own five-day ordeal-replete with Navy SEALs and a daring escape attempt-and the plight of his family in Vermont, watching the drama unfold on cable news. Despite his harrowing experience, Phillips stays afloat with steadfast faith and an unfailing sense of humor that are, ultimately, rewarded. Phillips's story is not just riveting and timely, but also an informative, heartening look at perhaps the least-celebrated branch of the U.S. military, the Merchant Marines." A reviewer of Penguin website wrote, "In A Captain's Duty, Richard Phillips tells his own extraordinary story - that of an ordinary man who did what he saw as his duty and in so doing became a hero. It is a thrilling true tale of adventure and courage in the face of deprivation, death threats and mock executions and also a compulsively readable first-hand account of the terrors of high-seas hostage-taking." == Film adaptation == Columbia Pictures optioned the book and acquired the life rights to Phillips in spring 2009.Kit, Borys. "Tom Hanks to Play Capt. Richard Phillips in Somali Pirate Hostage Story," The Hollywood Reporter (March 15, 2011). Barkhad Abdi starred as the lead Somali pirate, Tom Hanks starred as Phillips and Faysal Ahmed as Najee in a Columbia film based on the hijacking and Phillips's book, scripted by Billy Ray, and produced by the team behind The Social Network. The film, entitled Captain Phillips, was released on October 11, 2013, to widespread critical acclaim. ==References== Category:American non-fiction books Category:2010 non- fiction books Category:Piracy in Somalia Category:2009 in Somalia

2870659	A Captive in the Land	A Captive in the Land () is a 1990 Soviet–American survival drama film directed by John Berry and written by Berry and Lee Gold. The film is based on the 1962 novel of the same name by James Aldridge and stars Sam Waterston, Aleksandr Potapov and Keir Giles.Maltin 1994, p. 922. ==Plot== On an Arctic flight, the crew of a RAF transport aircraft overflies a crashed aircraft. Although a survivor is spotted, the crew realizes that a rescue is not possible and rules out a landing. Rupert Royce (Sam Waterston), a U.S. meteorologist aboard the flight, volunteers to parachute to the ice with first aid supplies to treat the survivor. Bringing supplies with him, Royce lands near the wreckage and finds Averyanov (Aleksandr Potapov), a Soviet navigator, the sole survivor who is injured and unable to be moved. Intending to wait until further help arrives, Royce makes repairs on the shattered aircraft, but soon realizes help is not coming, as the aircraft is far off course. The ice shifts below the wreckage, further complicating their survival. When a blizzard strands the two men and forces them to survive on their own, they have to accept that different cultural backgrounds cannot jeopardize their survival. As supplies run low and a leaking heater nearly kills them, releasing deadly carbon monoxide into their small enclosure, Royce begins to make plans for both of them to find a way to reach civilization, the nearest settlement, 200 miles away. The isolation, ever-present wolves and dwindling supplies leaves Royce little option. Setting out into the wilderness with an improvised sled to carry the injured airman, Averyanov urges Royce to save himself, and not to risk his own life in a vain attempt to save someone who will likely die soon anyway. Royce refuses and strives mightily to save the two "captives" of the wild. ==Cast== * Sam Waterston as Rupert Royce * Aleksandr Potapov as Averyanov * Keir Giles as Squadron Leader Cook * Tony Hall as RAF Plane Crew member * Victor Ignatyev as Chukchee * Aleksei Ivashchenko as RAF Plane Crew member * Albert Kondratyev as Chukchee * Sofron Yefimov as Chukchee * A.

Retrieved: December 23, 2016. Stephen Holden in his review for The New York Times, noted: "Had it stuck to the stark physical realities of the situation, "A Captive in the Land," which opens today at the Angelika Film Center, could have been a gripping film. But the movie, which was completed before the crumbling of the Soviet Union, insists on lending the relationship between the American and the Russian a turgid metaphoric significance."Holden, Stephen. "Review/Film; Discovering Brotherhood In the Arctic Wilderness." The New York Times, January 15, 1993. Retrieved: December 23, 2016. A later review in TV Guide has similar assessments: "The plot and theme of A CAPTIVE IN THE LAND dates back, of course, to Jack London, long a favorite author among Russians, and the entire film project is colored by the reconciliation of American and Russian. Whether as a joint production with Maxim Gorky Film Studios or as an expression of rival ideologies (in a brief argument between the characters that seem outdated and silly) 'A Captive in the Land' is oddly unexciting. Potapov's chatty and literate Russian does not mesh at all well with Waterston's laconic would-be hero, and the location scenes look like stock footage.""Review: 'A Captive in the Land'." TV Guide.

4697001	A Car-Tune Portrait	A Car-Tune Portrait is a cartoon in the Color Classics series produced by Fleischer Studios. Released on June 26, 1937,Cartoon Research entry the cartoon gives an imaginative take on Franz Liszt's Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2. ==Plot== After the brief opening credits set to an orchestrated version of the Minuet in G by Ludwig van Beethoven, the cartoon introduces a lion who is dressed as a musical conductor and attempts to keep his orchestra of animal musicians in order as they half-play and half-fight their way through the piece. Memorable moments include a dachshund playing the xylophone with his back legs while the rest of him sleeps, a group of monkeys using a flute as a pea-shooter to fire at their fellow musicians, and a horse trombonist who attempts to swat a fly with his trombone, but only succeeding in hitting the dog trumpeter in front of him. In keeping with the building frenzy of Liszt's rhapsody, the animals become more and more violent, playing pranks on each other and generally wreaking havoc, but the piece still goes on. The final scenes see the lion conductor getting smashed over the head with a giant bass drum, at which point he gives in, the music finishes, and the cartoon ends. ==Similar cartoons== Other cartoons with similar plots include the Oscar- nominated shorts, Rhapsody in Rivets and The Magic Fluke; an Oscar-winning short, The Cat Concerto; a Merrie Melodie short, Rhapsody Rabbit with Bugs Bunny; a Woody Woodpecker short, Convict Concerto, with a story by Hugh Harman; and a Looney Tunes short, Daffy's Rhapsody. ==See also== *Song Car- Tunes, 1924–1927 series of cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios and released by Red Seal Pictures. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1930s animated short films Category:1937 short films Category:Color Classics cartoons Category:Fleischer Studios short films Category:1930s American animated films Category:1937 animated films Category:Paramount Pictures short films Category:Short films directed by Dave Fleischer Category:1930s English- language films Category:American animated short films Category:Animated films about lions Category:Films about classical music and musicians

5811854	A Caress of Twilight	A Caress of Twilight is the second novel in the Merry Gentry series by Laurell K. Hamilton. ==Plot introduction== A faerie princess turned private investigator in a world where faeries are not only known to the general public, but are also fashionable, the title heroine is Princess Meredith NicEssus, also known as Merry Gentry. As niece to Andais, The Queen of Air and Darkness, she is a royal of the Unseelie Court. While her aunt tried to kill her as a child, she has since offered her the title as crown princess as the Court needs more heirs. ==Plot summary== A Caress of Twilight begins a few months after the events of A Kiss of Shadows. It is December, and Merry and the Sidhe warriors she has chosen as her lovers have returned to Los Angeles, California. Merry has resumed working for the Grey Detective Agency and several of the Sidhe have also joined the payroll. Merry is approached by Maeve Reed, previously known as Conchenn before her exile from the Seelie Court and now a famous Hollywood actress. Maeve asks Merry to perform a fertility rite that will permit her to have a child by her dying human husband. In return, she tells the princess that the reason for her exile was that she had refused to become the wife of Taranis, King of Light and Illusion, because she believed he was sterile. Galen, badly injured by the demi-fey during A Kiss of Shadows, has yet to heal, despite the usually phenomenal healing abilities of a sidhe warrior. Merry approaches the Queen of the Demi-Fey, Niceven, regarding a cure. The price of the cure and an alliance is a weekly drink of Merry's blood by a surrogate to be chosen by Niceven. During Merry's first night in bed with Doyle, they are interrupted by Andais who reveals that the Nameless has been freed. The worst of both courts, the Nameless was the last great spell that Seelie and Unseelie had cooperated upon. They had stripped themselves of everything too awful for them to be permitted to stay in the United States, and from it had been formed the Nameless. A strange murder brings members of the Grey Agency, including Merry, to the scene. However, their presence is challenged by others of the police force and they are thrown off site. However, this is not before they have a chance to suspect that supernatural forces are at work. It is suspected that the lives had been sucked from the murder victims by the ghosts of dead gods. Nothing is said to the police, however, as the only known person to work such a spell was a sidhe and, if it were discovered, that fact could result in all sidhe being banished from the country. Healed from his injuries by Niceven's representative, Sage, Galen acts the part of the Green Man in the fertility ritual with Merry which results in Maeve Reed becoming pregnant. It begins to become clear that Taranis is also planning something as various social secretaries insist upon Merry attending first the Yule Ball and then a feast in her honour. This culminates in a conversation between Merry and Taranis himself. Finally, the Nameless attacks Maeve Reed's home. It is finally defeated by Merry and her companions, Merry herself showing for the first time her second Hand of Power - the Hand of Blood. The result of the destruction of the Nameless is the release of the magics which formed it; these magics transfer themselves to the victors, who begin to exhibit unforeseen side effects. ==Characters== ===Major characters=== A Caress of Twilight features the following major characters. * Andais - Queen of Air and Darkness, Merry's aunt, the sister of Essus, and mother of Cel.

The film stars Aden Gillett as Theseus, Sonia Williams as Hippolyta, Susannah Harker as Titania and Adrian Green as Oberon with Lorna Gayle as Bottom. There is an extensive cast of both English and Barbadian actors, this re-imagined traditional tale takes a twist under the full moon, as many wonders occur during this fated Caribbean Festival.

Additionally, it was nominated for the East End Film Festival in 2017 == Plot == Set in modern day, on the Caribbean island of Barbados, the film "plays out in a carnival atmosphere as Puck - the butler - and the staff of a tropical home, turn into mischievous fairies and tamper with the wedding plans of three couples". While Theseus and Hippolyta are returning nationals, we also reconvene with some of our beloved characters, including Birdman and a Changeling boy, the mechanicals re-imagined as fishermen, the fairies carrying mobile phones, and a female Bottom as a Black Belly Sheep. Through an intertwining of Caribbean and Shakespearean folklore, culture history, and the surrounding landscape, the story unfolds in chaos and madness as mystery, magic and romance take over underneath the Caribbean moonlight. Hermia is promised in marriage to Demetrius, but she is in love with Lysander, who is also secretly in love with her. Hermia must marry Demetrius or forfeit everything, so she and Lysander flee into the forest. Meanwhile, Helena pines for Lysander, but the more she pursues him (via mobile phone) the faster he flees. Meanwhile a group of fishermen and women are preparing for a talent contest by creating a play, The Untold Story of King JaJa and The Young Becca, based on a local folk song about the relationship between King Jaja of Opobo and a young Barbadian girl. Moving from the beach, to the dream-like and magical fairy kingdom in the forest, to the frenzy of the modern-day carnival, the story moves along as Oberon asks Puck to use a love potion on Queen Titania in order to make her fall in love with the first living creature she sees upon waking.

This film explores Caribbean folklore and culture through a unique and entertaining re-telling of one of Shakespeare's most beloved comedies. While other adaptations, notably Much Ado About Nothing (2012) are shot in mono-chrome, this film uses bold, vibrant, and hyper realistic colors to immerse the viewer into the fairy tale. Though it is not a straight retelling of Shakespeare's play, it includes a great portion of the original text and original soul of the play, intertwining it with an authentic, upbeat Barbadian soundtrack. As director Shakirah Bourne adds: "What you will see when you watch A Caribbean Dream is Shakespeare’s words spoken in Bajan dialect and with a Bajan accent, and the visuals will definitely help with the understanding of the play". Executive Producers: Christian Roberts and Keith Morris. == Reception == A Caribbean Dream garnered much attention over its release, and its unique multicultural production. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 67%, based on 6 reviews. On Caution Spoilers review aggregator website, the film receives 4 out of 5 stars. In her review, Sarah, a Rotten Tomatoes- approved critic, states: "It’s an excellent introduction to one of his loveliest plays, in an accessibly modern setting. And while cutting so much is always going to mean losing some depth, it is still a rather magical retelling of an age-old story". Writing for The Guardian, Cath Clarke gave the film three out of five stars. == References == Category:Films based on A Midsummer Night's Dream Category:2017 films
2300000	A Caribbean Mystery	A Caribbean Mystery is a work of detective fiction by British writer Agatha Christie, first published in the UK by the Collins Crime Club on 16 November 1964 and in the United States by Dodd, Mead and Company the following year. The UK edition retailed at sixteen shillings (16/-) and the US edition at $4.50. It features the detective Miss Marple. Two reviewers at the time the novel was published said that Agatha Christie was returning to the top of her form. A critic writing in 1990 judged this plot to be standard fare for any writer who travels to the Caribbean and needs double duty out of a vacation. Two of the major characters reappear in the novel Nemesis, published in 1971. Jason Rafiel reappears posthumously, and his assistant Esther Walters assists Miss Marple in the early chapters of the subsequent story. ==Plot summary== This story takes place at the Golden Palm resort on the Caribbean island of St Honoré. Miss Marple's nephew has paid for her to holiday there after a bout of ill health. She speaks with Major Palgrave, a well-travelled man with many stories to share. She sits, half listening, until Palgrave tells a story about a man who got away with murder more than once. When Palgrave asks her if she wants to see a picture of a murderer, she listens intently – but after he finds the snapshot in his wallet, he suddenly changes the subject. Miss Marple looks up to see why and spots several people nearby. The next day, when the maid Victoria finds Major Palgrave dead in his room, Miss Marple is convinced he was murdered. She asks Dr Graham to find the photo he mentioned, pretending it is of her nephew, but it is not found. Meanwhile, she interviews the others: Tim and Molly Kendal, owners of the hotel; the Prescotts, a clergyman and his sister; Mr Jason Rafiel, a tycoon confined to a wheelchair; Jackson, his nurse/masseur/attendant/valet; Esther Walters, his secretary; the American Lucky Dyson and her husband, Greg; and Edward and Evelyn Hillingdon. On the beach, Miss Marple sees Señora de Caspearo, a woman on holiday who says she remembers Major Palgrave because he had an 'evil eye'. Miss Marple corrects her that he had a glass eye, but she still says that it was evil. Victoria informs the Kendals that she did not remember seeing the high blood pressure medication, Serenite, in Major Palgrave's room before his death, although it was found on his table after his death. That night, Victoria is found stabbed to death. Molly begins having nightmares. Miss Marple finds Jackson looking at Molly's cosmetics; he says that if belladonna were added to one of them, it would cause nightmares. The following night, Tim finds Molly unconscious on the floor, apparently having taken an overdose of sleeping pills. The police are involved, and the cook, Enrico, tells them he saw Molly holding a steak knife before going outside. Miss Marple asks the others if Major Palgrave told people about the photo. Others claim Palgrave said it was not a photo of a wife killer but a husband killer. When police realize that the high blood pressure medicine did not belong to Major Palgrave, his body is exhumed and the autopsy reveals that he died by poison, as Miss Marple expected. At night, Miss Marple is woken by the sounds of a search party. She is told that Tim woke up to find his wife missing. They find what seems to be her body in a creek, but it turns out to be Lucky; the two women resemble one another. Miss Marple abruptly realises who the major saw that night when he recognised the person in the snapshot as someone on the island. She wakes Mr Rafiel and Jackson, calling herself Nemesis, and they go to the Kendals' house. There they find Tim offering Molly a drink. Miss Marple tells Jackson to take the glass away. She says there is a deadly narcotic in it. While Jackson holds Tim down, She explains that Tim is the wife killer recognised by Major Palgrave. Miss Marple had thought Palgrave saw the Hillingdons and the Dysons over her right shoulder as they were coming up the beach, but had just realised that he had a glass eye on the left, so he could not have seen them. Tim and Molly were sitting on her left. Further, the story that the major told Miss Marple of the husband serially killing his wives and not getting caught, was the story of Tim Kendal. Tim was planning to kill Molly soon, and so had to kill Major Palgrave when he recognised Tim. He also killed Victoria, who remembered the Serenite being in the wrong room. Tim put belladonna in Molly's cosmetics to make her appear mad to the others. Tim had asked his wife to meet him by the creek, but Molly had been distracted by a vision due to the belladonna and wandered off. Tim saw Lucky and mistook her for Molly in the darkness. He was about to poison Molly when Miss Marple interrupted him. Esther Walters suddenly insists that Tim is not a killer. Tim shouts at her to keep quiet. He had been planning to marry Esther, after Molly's death, because he had heard that she was going to inherit a large sum of money from Jason Rafiel. Mr Rafiel chooses to invest some money in Molly when she takes on running the Golden Palm resort herself. Miss Marple takes her flight home to England after her holiday in the tropical warmth. ==Characters== *Miss Marple: An elderly spinster detective with an eye for detail and unexpected clues, with a "mind like a sink". She is sent on a Caribbean holiday by her nephew. *Major Palgrave: An elderly, garrulous man with a glass eye who tells stories from past, some of which stories have photographs or news clips to illustrate them. *Tim Kendal: A man in his thirties married to Molly Kendal, who marries her using false references and starts the hotel with her, using her money. *Molly Kendal: Tim's pretty young wife who starts the hotel where the story takes place with him. She eventually believes she has fallen mentally ill and confides it to Evelyn, although her symptoms are the result of being poisoned. *Jason Rafiel: A cantankerous old man with a large fortune and an unexpectedly kind spirit, who takes a shine to Miss Marple. *Esther Walters: Jason Rafiel's secretary, (the widow of a poor provider) with a child at school in England. *Victoria: A St Honoré native who is the one to discover Major Palgrave's death and the mysterious bottle of Serenite. She has a common-law marriage with two children and is the second victim to be killed. *Greg Dyson: A nature lover, who is now married to Lucky, his second wife. *Lucky Dyson: An attractive American woman who is married to Greg. She had plotted to kill his first wife, along with Edward Hillingdon, whom she tricked into guilt for his actions, and then seduced. She is the third murder victim. *Edward Hillingdon: The husband of Evelyn and an avid nature lover. He has children at a boarding school and has an affair with Lucky. *Evelyn Hillingdon: A woman who does not love her husband Edward but stays with him both for their public image and for their children. *Señora de Caspearo: A South American woman on holiday who opposes ugliness and, therefore Major Palgrave and Jason Rafiel. She remarks on Major Palgrave's glass eye as an evil eye. *Miss Prescott: An elderly woman who enjoys gossiping and has come on holiday with her brother, Canon Prescott. *Canon Prescott: Miss Prescott's brother, a member of the clergy, who dislikes his sister's gossiping. *Dr Graham: The St Honoré doctor, slowly retiring from practice, who treats Miss Marple who pretends to be ill, cares for Molly and confirms the deaths of the murdered people. *Jackson: Mr Rafiel's valet/masseur/attendant who (by admission to Miss Marple) worked at a cosmetic company. ==Literary significance and reception== After lukewarm reviews of her two previous novels, Francis Iles (Anthony Berkeley Cox) felt that the writer was back on form in his review in The Guardian's issue of 11 December 1964: "Mrs Agatha Christie has done it again. In A Caribbean Mystery she tells the reader explicitly what is going to happen; and yet when it does, nine out of ten will be taken completely by surprise – as I was. How does she do it? For the rest, it is Miss Marple this time who is in charge of the story; and all one can guess is that the setting is a Caribbean island." Maurice Richardson in The Observer of 15 November 1964 began, "A most encouraging return to somewhere very near her best unputdownable form. ... Suspicion nicely distributed among guests, many of them raffish adulterers. Not very hard to guess, but quite suspenseful. Good varied characterisation including a particularly excellent octogenarian tycoon."The Observer, 15 November 1964 p. 26 Towards the end of the year, Richardson again commented on the book in a special Books of the Year: A Personal Choice column when he said, "Agatha Christie makes one of those gratifying veteran's comebacks." The Daily Mirror of 21 November 1964 wrote: "Not quite at the top of her form. A Miss Marples (sic) story which addicts won't find as unsolvable as usual." Robert Barnard said of this novel, that it was "In the tradition of all those package-tour mysteries written by indigent crime writers who have to capitalize on their meagre holidays. Nothing much of interest, but useful for illustrating the 'fluffification' of Miss Marple. Reuses a ploy from Appointment with Death." "There is no more cunning player of the murder game than Agatha Christie." — Sunday Times "Throws off the false clues and misleading events as only a master of the art can do." — The New York Times ==Dedication== The novel is dedicated to John Cruikshank Rose, "with happy memories of my visit to the West Indies". Christie and her husband Max Mallowan became friends with John Rose in 1928 at the archaeological site at Ur. He was the architectural draftsman and when Max was in charge of the dig in Greater Syria at Tell Arpachiyah, Iraq in 1932, he hired Rose to be his draftsman. Rose was Scottish, and as Christie described him, "a beautiful draughtsman, with a quiet way of talking, and a gentle humour that I found irresistible." ==References in other works== The millionaire Jason Rafiel appears again, posthumously, in the novel Nemesis where he sends Miss Marple on a case specifically because of her success in solving the events related in A Caribbean Mystery. == Adaptations== ===Television=== A 1983 US TV movie adaptation starred Helen Hayes as Miss Marple and Barnard Hughes as Mr Rafiel. The New York Times says that Miss Marple has "a carload of suspects" to figure out why her friend was killed, in this film that first aired 22 October 1983. The screenplay was credited to Sue Grafton, later a mystery writer, and Steve Humphrey. A BBC TV adaptation starring Joan Hickson was shown in 1989 as part of the series Agatha Christie's Miss Marple, with Donald Pleasence co-starring as Mr Rafiel. Few changes were made from the novel: the Prescotts and Señora de Caspearo were omitted, Miss Marple holidayed on Barbados rather than the fictional island of "St Honoré" (the name Honoré reappears as the fictional main town in the BBC series Death in Paradise that began airing in 2011), and the blood pressure medication was renamed Tetrauwolfide. The production was made and aired after the production of Nemesis (1987) leading to some viewer confusion, because Rafiel is dead at the commencement of the latter story. In the earlier production, the part of Jason Rafiel was portrayed by Frank Gatliff, rather than Donald Pleasence. The 1989 version is the only adaptation as of 2017 to be filmed in the Caribbean, specifically on location on the island of Barbados; the 1983 TV movie was shot in California, while the 2013 version was filmed in Cape Town. In 2013, the book was adapted for the sixth series of ITV's Agatha Christie's Marple, starring Julia McKenzie as Miss Marple and co-starring Antony Sher as Jason Rafiel, Oliver Ford Davies as Major Palgrave, Hermione Norris as Evelyn Hillingdon and Robert Webb and Charity Wakefield as the Kendalls. The characters are much the same as in the novel, and the location is the same. At the end, Tim tries to shoot Molly rather than poison her, but the gun's bullets have been replaced with blanks. Like other episodes in the previous series, it includes characters based on real persons. One is fledgling novelist Ian Fleming, who needs a name for his spy hero. The other is ornithologist James Bond (Charlie Higson), who begins a lecture to his fellow guests by introducing himself as "...Bond, James Bond", which solves Fleming's problem. (Fleming, who was an avid bird-watcher, did take the name from the ornithologist, though they had not met.) As with the Joan Hickson versions, A Caribbean Mystery was adapted after Nemesis, despite the books' publication order. Nemesis was adapted in Season 3, Episode 4 airing on 1 January 2009 in the UK, while A Caribbean Mystery was aired as Season 6 Episode 1, airing 16 June 2013 in the UK, over 4 years later. US release was on 16 September 2014. This led to some continuity issues: in the 2009 version of Nemesis, Jason Rafiel is a German writer, but in A Caribbean Mystery (2013), he is an English chemical manufacturer. Miss Marple does not refer to herself as Nemesis at any time in this adaptation, despite herself and Mr Rafiel associating the name Nemesis with her in both novels. Just like in the Joan Hickson versions, Mr Rafiel is portrayed by different actors: Antony Sher portrays him here, but in Nemesis, he makes voice appearances by Herbert Lom (who previously appeared in the 2004 version of The Murder at the Vicarage as Monsieur Dufosse). The novel was adapted as a 2016 episode of the French television series Les Petits Meurtres d'Agatha Christie. ===Radio=== Michael Bakewell wrote a BBC Radio adaptation first broadcast in October 1997, with June Whitfield as Miss Marple. Señora de Caspearo is omitted but the plot of the novel is generally retained. ==Publication history== * 1964, Collins Crime Club (London), 16 November 1964, Hardcover, 256 pp * 1965, Dodd Mead and Company (New York), Hardcover, 245 pp * 1966, Fontana Books (Imprint of HarperCollins), Paperback, 157 pp * 1966, Pocket Books (New York), Paperback, 176 pp * 1976, Ulverscroft Large-print Edition, Hardcover, 316 pp * 1979, Greenway edition of collected works (William Collins), Hardcover, 256 pp; * 1979, Greenway edition of collected works (Dodd Mead), Hardcover, 256 pp * 2006, Marple Facsimile edition (Facsimile of 1964 UK first edition), 6 March 2006, Hardcover; *2008, Indian Version (ASIAN); Odyssey RS. 150 The novel was serialised in the Star Weekly Novel, a Toronto newspaper supplement, in two abridged instalments from 16 to 23 January 1965, with each issue containing an uncredited cover illustration. ==References== ==External links== *A Caribbean Mystery at the official Agatha Christie website * * * Category:1964 British novels Category:Collins Crime Club books Category:Miss Marple novels Category:Novels set in the Caribbean Category:Novels set in hotels Category:British novels adapted into films Category:British novels adapted into television shows Category:Poisoning in fiction

22643293	A Carmen of the North	A Carmen of the North () is a 1919 Dutch silent romantic drama film directed by Maurits Binger. ==Plot== Jozef (Adelqui Migliar) is a young farmer who has been ordered to leave his mother (Paula de Waart) and childhood sweetheart Mareike (Jeanne van der Pers), in order to join the army during the Great War. Carmen (Annie Bos) is a fatally attractive coquette living in the poor quarters, and working in a cigarette factory. One day, she plays a practical joke on one of her co-workers. The girl can't appreciate this and starts a fight; to which Carmen responds by stabbing her with a knife. Stationed in the factory, Jozef is ordered to hold Carmen. While being guarded, Carmen successfully seduces Jozef and convinces him to undo her from her handcuffs: "For Carmen's heart was fickle. Her passions wild and bold. Proud of every conquest. And fond of foolish gold." She gratefully thanks him and then escapes through the window. While she joins her confederates - a group of bandits - Jozef feels guilty not for having released her, but for having fallen in love with her. He is arrested for having helped a fugitive, and is imprisoned. One day, Jozef receives a letter from Carmen: "Come to me Jozef, and I shall show you the way to freedom, where none shall be afraid of their past – no loss or trouble to either of us again." He is able to distract his guards and flees to the bar where Carmen is staying. He feels guilty for kissing her, but then starts a fight with another man who seduces her. Afterward, the guards arrive at the bar to search for Jozef, and he is convinced by Carmen to join her as a fugitive. They become part of an organised crime, which includes Carmen entertaining a group of soldiers, while the other men, among them Jozef, get the stuff over the border. Meanwhile, Mareike has left her home to search for Jozef on the cold streets. She is satisfied to find him, but Jozef orders her to leave. He then returns to Carmen, and demands that she will never love another man. Carmen, aware that she can't live up to Jozef's expectations, finds refuge in a bar. Jozef follows her and blames her for having ruined his life. He then leaves, as he realizes that his love for Carmen is gone. The same night, Carmen falls for Dalboni (Jan van Dommelen), a celebrated baritone. She seduces him, and he in turn is impressed with her. Several nights later, Dalboni reads from The Bohemian Girl. Carmen, realizing that she has fallen in love with Dalboni, writes to Jozef that she no longer can see him. A year later, she is a happily married woman living in extreme wealth, while Jozef wanders through the streets. At the premiere of an opera, Dalboni is praised by the audience, and he calls Carmen his inspiration. "But the shadow returned again. The man forsaken came out of her past." Jozef finds Carmen backstage and confronts her with all that she has caused in his life. When he asks her if she still loves him, she responds by describing her love for Dalboni: "He is everything to me. Now, at last, I know what real love is. I shall live for him alone." In a rage, Jozef condemns Carmen and stabs her to death. ==Cast== * Annie Bos as Carmen * Adelqui Migliar as Jozef * Jan van Dommelen as Dalboni * Paula de Waart as Jozef's moeder * Jeanne van der Pers as Mareike * Ernst Winar * Fred Homann * Leni Marcus ==Alternative ending== In the copies that surfaced in America, Jozef, while trying to kill Carmen, was overpowered by Dalboni. He was sent to prison, where he spent two years of his life: "Back to the depths – the end of a fool's paradise." Mareike and his mother visited him in prison, and Jozef begged them for forgiveness. After his release, he returned to Mareike, who had decided to forgive him: "Then the gold returned to the sun and every day was bright with the joy of living." == External links == * Category:1919 films Category:Dutch black-and-white films Category:Films based on Carmen Category:Films directed by Maurits Binger Category:Dutch silent feature films Category:1919 romantic drama films Category:Dutch romantic drama films Category:Silent romantic drama films
26916427	A Carne	A Carne (in ) is a 1888 Naturalist novel by Júlio Ribeiro. It is one of the most controversial works of the Brazilian literature, being frequently compared and considered as a forerunner to D. H. Lawrence's Lady Chatterley's Lover. ==Plot== Lenita is a young, naïve 22-year-old woman who, recently orphaned, goes to live with an old farmer who raised her father. In the farmer's house, she meets his son, Manuel Barbosa, a divorced man. They soon start a forbidden love relationship. ==Criticism== A Carne has themes considered to be "strong" for the time it was released (the 19th century), such as divorce and heavy eroticism, among others. Many people have negatively reviewed the romance, such as José Veríssimo and Alfredo Pujol. The most vehement critic was the priest Sena Freitas, who wrote an article entitled A Carniça () for the famous newspaper Diário Mercantil, for which the book's author, Júlio Ribeiro, also worked. Ribeiro refuted Freitas' critiques in the articles O Urubu Sena Freitas (). Freitas' and Ribeiro's articles were compiled and published posthumously in 1934 under the title Uma Polêmica Célebre (). Ribeiro once said, referring to his position: ==Adaptations== The novel was adapted into an eponymous film in 1975. Directed by J. Marreco, it starred Selma Egrei, Newton Prado and Geraldo Del Rey. Unlike the book however, it was not a controversial film, since it was made during the "pornochanchada" period. ==References== ==External links== * Downloadable version of the book Category:1888 novels Category:Brazilian erotic novels Category:Naturalist novels Category:Brazilian novels adapted into films

There was an 8 p.m. transmission on Channel 13 and an 8:45 p.m. transmission on Channel 21, the former accompanied by a stereo simulcast on WQXR. In 1992 PBS broadcast the concert again, and Sony released it on VHS and Laserdisc.A Carnegie Hall Christmas Concert, Sony VHS, 1992A Carnegie Hall Christmas Concert, Sony Laserdisc, 1992 Subsequently, Kultur reissued the concert on DVD (catalogue number D4157). presenting it unabridged, framed at 4:3, in colour (using the NTSC video standard) and with Dolby Digital stereo sound. Kultur's disc offered no bonus features nor any liner notes beyond a rudimentary track listing. On 6 October 1992, Sony released the concert on a 76-minute CD (catalogue number SK 48235).A Carnegie Hall Christmas Concert, Sony CD, SK 48235, 1992 Sony's disc omitted the concert's only purely orchestral items (the opening fanfare and the Troika from Prokofiev's Lieutenant Kijé) and arranged the other pieces of music in a different order. It came with a 20-page insert booklet that included no texts or translations but provided a detailed track listing, an essay on the concert and seven photographs taken during the performance. In 2016 Sony reissued the album with a 52-page booklet in their 18-CD collection Frederica von Stade: The Complete Columbia Recital Albums (catalogue number 88875183412). ==Critical reception== John J. O'Connor reviewed the concert in a television column in The New York Times on 11 December 1991. He had mixed feelings about the producers' choice of music, some of which he thought hackneyed. "Am I the only person in New York", he asked, "who, after sitting through hundreds of ornate renditions, finds 'The 12 Days of Christmas' numbingly tedious?" He was more complimentary about the calypso-infused 'Mary's Little Boy Chile' and a sequence of traditional American Marian numbers, as well as rousing ensemble versions of 'Go Tell It on the Mountain' and 'Angels We Have Heard On High'. He conceded that Previn's conducting and the concert's specially commissioned arrangements made some old chestnuts sound new again. Battle, in puff-ball- sleeved scarlet, was "quite dazzling in her upper registers and gets there often enough to make sure no one forgets it". Von Stade, sheathed in glittering emerald, was more expressive in her hymns than in her spirituals. Wynton Marsalis punctuated proceedings with his trumpet's "soulful wailings". The standing ovation at the end of the concert was well earned. The English classical vocal critic J. B. Steane reviewed the CD edition of the concert in Gramophone in December 1992. He mocked the album's choice of compositions and arrangements, noting that 'The Twelve Days of Christmas' included a fragment of 'Ist ein Traum' from Der Rosenkavalier, that Reger's lullaby sounded like a duet that Strauss's Sophie and Octavian might have sung at their first Christmas together and that 'Silent Night' had been given a "smoochy accompaniment" which at times sounded as though it had been devised for another song altogether. For the performers, on the other hand, he had nothing but praise, applauding Battle's "unflawed purity of tone", von Stade's "characteristic warmth", Marsalis's eloquent trumpet, the cool expertise of his Septet and the geniality of Previn on the podium. All was bright and sweetly shining in the light of Carnegie Hall, he wrote – it was all "so happy and snappy, so gifted and sweet" that its sheer quantity of Christmas icing sugar made him scowl like Charles Dickens's Ebenezer Scrooge. Still, the concert was rich in ingenuity and charm and it was obvious that the audience had enjoyed it, and the album had captured the spirit of the occasion successfully.Gramophone, December 1992, p. 145 ==See also== * Christmas with Flicka, starring Frederica von Stade, Melba Moore, Rex Smith and Julius Rudel ==References== Category:Frederica von Stade albums Category:1991 television films Category:1991 films Category:1992 albums Category:1992 classical albums Category:Carnegie Hall Category:Christmas television films Category:Christmas television specials Category:Classical Christmas albums Category:Classical crossover albums Category:Classical video albums Category:Live classical albums

8373513	A Carol Christmas	A Carol Christmas is a TV movie starring Tori Spelling, Dinah Manoff, William Shatner, Jason Brooks and Gary Coleman. It premiered on the Hallmark Channel in 2003. The film is an adaptation of Charles Dickens' 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. ==Plot== Carol Cartman (Tori Spelling) is a conceited sensationalist talk show host. She is cynical, selfish, and generally treats her employees with cold contempt. She has been coached by her late Aunt Marla (Dinah Manoff) to behave this way. On Christmas Eve, hours before her talk show is set to go on the air for a holiday special, she is haunted by the spirit of Aunt Marla (who is wrapped in golden chains), who warns Carol of the mistakes she made in her life, and the terrible similar fate awaiting her if she does not change, also mentioning that she will be visited by three spirits that will show her her wrongs and attempt to steer her back on the right path. The Ghost of Christmas Past (Gary Coleman) shows Carol incidents from her childhood to adulthood where Aunt Marla shaped Carol into the person she is in the present: Marla fought for Carol to get the lead role in a Christmas play over another little girl who deserved the part, drove away her love interest, John Joyce, who was going to propose marriage to her, and pushed to advance her niece's career in order to bolster herself financially. Carol and the ghost's last stop is Aunt Marla's sparsely-attended funeral. The Ghost of Christmas Present (William Shatner) the takes Carol to see how her former love interest John, sister Beth, and assistant Roberta will spend this Christmas. John continues his work helping to feed the homeless, while Beth and her husband read A Christmas Carol to their children. Roberta's festivities with her daughter Lily and Carol's studio manager Jimmy are disrupted by a visit by Roberta's ex-husband and Lily's father Frank. The two addresses each other bitterly, and he reveals that he intends to take her to court for custody of Lily, and presents her with a document stating the same. The Ghost of Christmas Future (James Cromwell) is a mute limo driver who takes Carol on a tour, showing her what is apparently to happen starting next Christmas. Carol walks off her show after refusing to do a segment that hits too close to home for her, and her studio boss sues her for breach of contract; as a result, her career bottoms out and she is reduced to poverty and making low-level community appearances. Roberta goes to see Lily, now in her father's care. Lily is very upset and lashes out at her mother, who apparently is never able to visit due to being tied up with work. Finally, Carol watches herself die and learns that her funeral will have even fewer attendees than that of her Aunt Marla with only Roberta and Jimmy attending. Roberta reveals that Lily is now married and living in Chicago, and the two are now estranged due to the former's belief that her mother prioritized work over her. From her coffin, Carol pleads for another chance at life. The ghost shakes his head and closes it, but Carol wakes up in her dressing room. Changed by the encounters with the ghosts, Carol becomes a warm, caring person, and vows to make amends. She goes on to her television show and gives a touching speech to her audience about the importance of Christmas and giving. She also gives Roberta a raise, and time to be with Lily, and offers her her lawyer's assistance against her ex-husband's (future) attempt to get custody of Lily. After the show, she goes to her sister's house to spend the holidays with Beth and her family and reconciles with John, who has retained his feelings for her over the years. At the very end, the three Christmas Spirits reappear outside Beth's house and comment on their work at transforming Carol Cartman. They watch and listen as Beth's son recites the last line of A Christmas Carol: "God bless us, every one!" ==Cast== * Tori Spelling as Carol Cartman who is based on Ebeneezer Scrooge ** Gage Golightly as Young Carol * Dinah Manoff as Aunt Marla.

29610662	A Carousel for Missoula	A Carousel for Missoula is a volunteer-built, hand-carved carousel in Missoula, Montana, located on the Clark Fork River in Missoula's downtown Caras Park within walking distance of the historic Wilma Theatre, Jeannette Rankin Peace Center and Osprey baseball stadium. The carousel is accompanied by a volunteer-built park, Dragon Hollow. == Vision == thumb|250px|A mother and child enjoy a ride on the pony named Paint, at A Carousel for Missoula on April 13, 2010. The vision for A Carousel for Missoula began in 1988 when Missoula cabinet maker Chuck Kaparich visited a carousel in Spokane, Washington, and read the story of Charles I. D. Looff, "a Danish immigrant who created Spokane's now-antique carousel as a wedding present for his daughter Emma."Devlin, Sherry, Thomas Bauer, and John Engen. "A Carousel for Missoula: How a town came together to help a man build a dream". Missoula, Montana: The Missoulian, 1995. 4-19. Print. Inspired by the beauty and craftsmanship of the ponies, Kaparich decided he wanted to buy a carousel horse for himself. In 1990 he contacted Frederick Fried, carousel expert and author of A Pictorial History of Carousels. When Kaparich expressed his interest in purchasing a carousel horse, Fried responded with, "It's vultures like you who are causing the demise of the American carousel. If you want a carousel horse, don't take it off a carousel; carve your own."Cox, Theresa. "History of A Carousel for Missoula." The Brass Ring. I.V (2010): Print. So Kaparich did. By August 1991, Kaparich had carved four ponies. He approached the Missoula City Council with a deal: he would provide the mechanical works, frame, horses and chariots if the city would give the carousel a permanent home. The council agreed, and a board from the Missoula Redevelopment Agency was formed to oversee the project. Three years later, on February 12, 1993, Fried, after seeing pictures of the completed carousel ponies and plans for A Carousel for Missoula, wrote a letter to Kaparich and head carver John Thompson. Fried commented on the professionalism of the carving and called Missoula "a shining example to the rest of the United States, inspiring other townships to create their own home- and-hand-made carousels."Geoff, Badenoch. The Brass Ring. I.X (1993): Print. == History == In 1918 the Alan Herschell-Spillman Company of North Tonawanda, New York, created a 38-animal carousel adorned with dogs, frogs, zebras, and roosters as well as horses.Kaparich, Chuck. The Brass Ring. I.XIII (1993): Print. In 1959, Bob Anderson of California erected the Herschell-Spillman carousel at Incline Village amusement park near Lake Tahoe, Nevada, better known as Ponderosa Ranch where the 1960s television western Bonanza was filmed. By 1959 the carousel had undergone significant wear, and many of the original animals were switched for less elaborate ones. The carousel continued to operate in Nevada until 1983, when it was dismantled and the animals were sold at auction. The frame was sold to a secondhand dealer, then to a museum curator in Polson, Montana. The Montana man purchased the frame because it came as part of a package deal with a small children's train. In 1991 the frame was sold to Chuck Kaparich of Missoula for $3,000. The frame, weighing approximately tons when fully loaded with ponies and chariots, has over 16,000 parts. Before being assembled in its current Missoula location, the volunteer mechanical crew of A Carousel for Missoula replaced the frame's bolts, and cleaned and repainted the other pieces. Originally, the carousel operated on a steam-powered, leather belt-driven motor. A Carousel for Missoula replaced it with a 10-horsepower motor with a fluid clutch. == Funding and building == Funds to pay for A Carousel for Missoula's carving materials came from auctions and pony "adoptions". Families, businesses, and individuals could pay $2,500 to name, design and adopt a carousel pony. Four horses were adopted by Missoula school children who collected 1 million pennies, or $10,000, for the cause. The Missoula Building Industry Association adopted a chariot and designed it to be accessible for wheelchair users.Geoff, Badenoch. The Brass Ring. I.IX (1993): Print. In July 1992, all 38 horses and both chariots on A Carousel for Missoula were adopted by donors in the Missoula area, ultimately raising $100,000 in cash and pledges.Geoff, Badenoch. The Brass Ring. I.VI (1992): Print. In March 1992 the carousel was designated for a site in the west end of Missoula's Caras Park. The Missoula Redevelopment Agency Board voted to sponsor a design competition among interested architects to develop designs for the carousel building. J. Kirby and Associates of Missoula won the competition with their "jewel box" design.Geoff, Badenoch. The Brass Ring. I.VIII (1993): Print. In 1994, over $200,000 for building construction were raised through auctions, private donations and band organ song "adoptions". An additional $58,000 came from donations of materials and labor. A Carousel for Missoula was officially completed on May 27, 1995. About five years later, volunteers reunited to build an addition to A Carousel for Missoula; an outdoor park named Dragon Hollow. Many Missoula individuals and businesses donated time, materials and money to complete the park. In December 2000, Rosemary Gallagher donated $25,000 to Dragon Hollow. The Dennis & Phyllis Washington Foundation also pledged $15,000. Home Depot of Missoula sponsored the park's birthday pavilion, and every Missoula Home Depot employee volunteered to help with construction."Dragon Hollow." Brass Ring. VIII.I (2000): Print. In spring of 2001, over 4,000 volunteers built Dragon Hollow in nine days."Magic Is Made By Volunteers." A Carousel for Missoula. N.p., 27 Nov. 2010. Web. 27 Nov 2010. . Since its opening, the carousel has given about 225,000 rides per year.The Brass Ring. VII.II(2000): Print. == Carving and creation == Kaparich teamed with design coordinator Cherry Gillespie and head carver John Thompson to design, create and oversee the completion of the ponies, chariots, band organ and artistic elements of A Carousel for Missoula.Badenoch, Geoff. The Brass Ring. I.VI (1992): Print. A staff composed entirely of volunteers completed the carving, sanding and painting of the 38 ponies and two chariots, as well as the other decorative pieces. Carving classes taught over 50 volunteers how to create gargoyles, mirror frames, and the horses' legs, bodies, manes, and heads. A restoration and mechanical crew revitalized the parts and pieces of the carousel frame Kaparich had purchased. The ponies, weighing when completed, were carved from basswood, the soft yet durable wood of linden trees. The ponies were not carved in one solid piece, but seven separate pieces: head, neck, body and four legs. Volunteers and the ponies' "adoptive" families tucked memorabilia inside the ponies' hollow bodies before they were assembled and painted. Traditional carousel ponies come in three styles. Coney Island ponies are baroque and bejeweled, Philadelphia ponies more realistic and Country renditions more primitive. Bette Largent, who painted and restored ponies for Spokane's Looff carousel before training the volunteer painters in Missoula, said A Carousel for Missoula created a unique, distinctive style tagged as the "Garden City steeds". In the book A Carousel for Missoula Largent said, "The Missoula ponies are accurate, but always with a good measure of whimsy and humor. They are sturdy, yet remarkable in detail." Kaparich said he believes "the diversity of Missoula's horses came from the decision to adopt them out to donors, who then had rights to the design." Approximately 800 hours of work went into the completion of each pony. Finally, the canopy of the carousel was adorned with 966 light bulbs, 14 carved gargoyles in frames, and 14 carved frames holding etched mirrors. A hand-carved wooden dragon, named Lucky Red Ringer, was made as a unique way for riders to play the historical brass ring game. Plastic rings are loaded into a tube that fits inside the length of the dragon's body and exits the dragon's mouth. Lucky Red Ringer perches in a wooden hand-carved tree, close enough to the outside row of carousel horses for riders to grab the plastic rings from the dragon's mouth while the carousel is in motion. One brass ring is added to the ring tube, and the rider who grabs the brass ring wins a free ride. Lucky Red Ringer, upon close examination, has a wedding ring carved onto his finger. Head carver Thompson added the wedding ring to the dragon's finger after his wife claimed Thompson spent more time with Lucky Red Ringer than her."A Carousel for Missoula."

Web. 30 Nov 2010. http://www.nca- usa.org/psp/Missoula/ == The band organ == Scott Olson, a volunteer for A Carousel for Missoula, was committed to finding a band organ to complete the mood of the carousel. In April 1992, Don Stinson's band organ company in Bellefontaine, Ohio, began to construct an organ to Missoula's specifications. Olson traveled to Ohio three times that year to oversee construction of the organ. years and $65,000 later, the organ arrived in Missoula. The organ contains over 400 hand-made wooden pipes and has the sound capacity of 23 instruments. It works like a player piano, using paper song rolls. Holes in the paper rolls signal specific pipes to create music. Each roll has ten songs and plays for about 40 minutes.Olson, Scott. The Brass Ring. I.VII (1992): Print. Several music rolls were created just for the carousel, featuring music "adopted" by local donors, such as the fight song of the University of Montana. The organ was enclosed by an 8-foot-high, 17-foot-wide, wooden facade depicting a medieval scene with cliffs, castles, knights and dragons, all hand-carved by Glenn Watters of Missoula in less than two years. The band organ at A Carousel for Missoula is the largest carousel band organ in continuous use in America. == Visitor information == During non-public hours the carousel can be rented for private events and celebrations for 100 sit- down, or 200 standing room guests.

61837968	A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur	A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur () is an oil-on-canvas snowscape painting by French impressionist Claude Monet. The painting depicts a man on a wooden cart travelling along a snow-laden road in Honfleur. A Cart on the Snowy Road at Honfleur is one of nearly 140 snowscapes painted by Monet. It is believed to be his first completed snowscape, and is similar to other snowscapes by him such as The Road in Front of Saint-Simeon Farm in Winter, The Magpie, Snow at Argenteuil, and The Red Cape. The painting is thought to be heavily influenced by the snowscapes of Japanese artist Utagawa Hiroshige (1797–1858), such as Ochanomizu and Clear weather after snow at Kaneyama (1797–1858). Aspects such as the single vanishing point and varied colors of snow can also trace their influences back to Japan. ==Influences== ==See also== * List of paintings by Claude Monet ==References== Category:1865 paintings Category:Paintings by Claude Monet
51090748	A Cartload of Clay	A Cartload of Clay (1971) is the last and unfinished novel by the Australian author George Johnston. It is a sequel to My Brother Jack and Clean Straw for Nothing, the third in the Meredith trilogy of semi-autobiographical novels by Johnson.A Cartload of Clay by George Johnston, Austlit ==Story outline== The novel follows David Meredith over the period of several hours as he contemplates his life, the death of his wife and his own impending end. ==Critical reception== John Lleonart in The Canberra Times put the book into its context: "A Cartload of Clay is a mellow, often distinctly melancholy autobiographical essay. Johnston had intended it to be a novel but the fact that it is structurally incomplete does not detract from it. The absence of a contrived ending is, indeed, a factor in the book's impact as a human document...There is no doubt that the Johnston trilogy has reached a plane where neither the most determined parochial masochism and self-revelation can harm it. And even if, while writing this last painful episode, he was over- conscious about not being well-known outside Australia, that too may serve a worthwhile purpose. Any Australian writer who in future can produce work of the quality of the Johnston trilogy will surely know he does not have to apologise for it to anybody."John Lleonart, "A writer's swansong", The Canberra Times, 16 October 1971, p15 ==See also== * 1971 in literature ==References== Category:1971 Australian novels Category:Unfinished novels Category:Australian autobiographical novels Category:William Collins, Sons books
32729135	A Cartoonist's Nightmare	A Cartoonist's Nightmare is a 1935 Warner Bros. theatrical cartoon short in the Looney Tunes series, starring Beans the Cat in his first solo film. The film was directed by Jack King and was released on September 21, 1935. ==Plot== It is closing time at an animation studio and all the staff members are calling it a day. Meanwhile, an animator chooses to carry on with his work while a custodian keeps on watch. In his drawing, he sketches a dungeon scene where Beans the Cat encounters a goblin. Weary for working several hours continuously, the animator decides to take a little snooze. Before ending the session, he draws a steel barricade between the two characters to prevent the goblin from reaching Beans. Suddenly, the goblin comes to life and pulls him into the drawing. The goblin carries the animator away, heading somewhere beyond the scene. Shocked and terrified, the animator tries in vain to break out of the goblin's grasp. He is then brought into a mystic chamber where painted portraits of various villains are displayed on the walls. The villains happened to be the animator's creations as well as those of his colleagues. They too come to life and emerge from their illustrations. As revenge for how he and other cartoonists made them get subdued in the end of each film, the villains give the animator a pencil and force him to draw a deep pit in the floor where they toss him inside. Upon falling in, the animator holds onto a branch, trying to avoid being devoured by the crocodile at the bottom. Back at the scene still being worked on, Beans still stands behind the barricade, boredly waiting for his artist to come back. Just then, Little Kitty comes to him, offering a lunchbox. Beans is expecting food but is a little surprised to find a saw in the bread. He uses it to cut his way out of the metal fence. Finally freeing himself, he goes around to find his animator. In no time, Beans finds the chamber where his animator is being tormented. To intervene, he hurls a boot at the goblin, luring the villains away as they try to capture him. Beans manages to lose them somehow when he returns to the place to rescue the troubled man. The animator then receives a pencil from Beans and draws a ladder to climb out the pit. When the villains return, Beans squirts grease from a grease gun between the room's entrance and the pit. The villains slide on the grease mess and fall into the hole, except for the goblin, who attempts to escape from the hole, but is punched by the angry animator into it. To vanquish them for good, the animator removes the hole with an eraser. Beans and the animator shake hands for a work well done. It turns out that what the animator went through was merely a dream, as he is awaken by the custodian. To his relief, he finds the drawing on his desk unchanged. Not wanting to recall his experience, the animator erases the goblin and the steel barricade, leaving only Beans in the picture. As a compliment to his little friend, he draws a platter with gelatin on top for Beans to eat. ==Analysis== According to animation historian Michael Samerdyke, some classic Hollywood cartoons from the 1930s are "too scary for children" and A Cartoonist's Nightmare is one of them. He finds it to be a "very inventive" and interesting cartoon.Samerdyke (2013), 1935, pp. unnumbered pages Samerdyke notes that Beans the Cat had previously appeared in I Haven't Got a Hat (1935) as a tough little kitten. A Cartoonist's Nightmare casts Beans into the role of a hero. This gives "a nice heroic moment" for a character with a rather brief film career. Beans would not stay for long within the cast of characters of Warner Bros. Cartoons. To Samerdyke, the main villain of the short (described as the goblin above) more closely resembles a gorilla. The rest of the villains seem to reside in the Villain Department of the studio. They sing their own villainous song: "The tables are turned and now you are in our clutches". It is sung to the tune of "The Teddy Bears' Picnic" (1907). The villains plan to dispose of the anonymous cartoonist, while Beans comes to the rescue. Beans is in effect rescuing his own creator. The cartoonist rewards him by drawing some ice cream and allowing the cat to enjoy it. The film's setting is an animated cartoon studio. Samerdyke notes that the building is depicted in a state of severe disrepair. It somewhat resembles a prison. Samerdyke speculates that these elements of the film could reflect the actual working conditions of the animators employed by Leon Schlesinger. The film features interactions between a cartoonist and a living, sentient cartoon character (Beans). In this way it resembles (and foreshadows) Duck Amuck (1953) and Who Framed Roger Rabbit (1988). Terry Lindvall and Matthew Melton have included this film in an analysis of reflexive cartoons, those whose narrative reveals something about the art of animation and filmmaking. The writers find that Jack King's A Cartoonist's Nightmare clearly draws a portrait of what animators feel about their craft.Lindvall, Melton (2012), pp. 71-72 The opening scenes are telling. The scenes of the staff leaving the animation resemble crazy people leaving an asylum. The wife of the cartoonist attempts to pull him away from his work and fails. He is obsessively devoted to his work and claims that he has to "finish tonight". He eventually falls asleep at his own drawing board. The cartoonist is pulled into the cartoon by a wicked character of his own creation. Lindvall and Melton find this scene to resemble a segment of Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), "It's a Good Life" directed by Joe Dante. In this segment a live- action character is incarcerated in a cartoon television program. As the villain (described as a "hairy monster" by the writers), drags the captive cartoonist through the corridors of the studio, various sections are seen. Among them a gag department, a story department, a music department. The cartoon villains occupy a dungeon-like section of their own. Regarding the depiction of the other villains, each has been assigned a number of their own. For example, "Battling Barney" is #20 and "Dirty Dan" is #130. These characters have apparently been created by the cartoonist, products of his imagination. And they have reasons to resent him. They sing to him: "It's our turn. Now you are in our clutches! We are creations from your pen, it's in your hands we lie; you always manage to have us sin, now by your own hand you die." The characters blame their creator for causing them to commit sins. They seem to argue that they are not inherently bad people, they have been drawn that way. A sentiment echoed in another film by Jessica Rabbit. ==Home media== The short was released on the 'Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 6. ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== * * * A Cartoonist's Nightmare on the Internet Archive Category:1935 films Category:1935 animated films Category:1930s American animated films Category:1930s animated short films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Films about nightmares Category:Films scored by Bernard B.

28724064	A Casa (play)	A Casa is a theatrical comedy in two acts, written by Miguel M. Abrahão in 1978 and published first in 1983 in Brazil.UFSC ==Plot summary== A Casa, tells a simple story, but its great strength lies in the description passionate and accomplice of the characters. The theme of the play revolves around a seemingly bitter and cynical idea: a woman should become a prostitute, to sustain itself without effort. Josinalda, a lady of strict principles, maintains in his house with his meager salary, Liduina, your sister, Fredegund, your niece, and Creuzilene, your neighbor . Life is peaceful and marked by seemingly commons issues until, unexpectedly, a bandit enters the residence of distinguished ladies, making them hostages. The play then becomes a police comedy, and thus a fascinating intellectual game of cat and mouse, where not everything looks, like really is.COUTINHO, Afrânio; SOUSA, J. Galante de.

1719074	A Case of Conscience	A Case of Conscience is a science fiction novel by American writer James Blish, first published in 1958. It is the story of a Jesuit who investigates an alien race that has no religion yet has a perfect, innate sense of morality, a situation which conflicts with Catholic teaching. The story was originally published as a novella in 1953, and later extended to novel-length, of which the first part is the original novella. The novel is the first part of Blish's thematic After Such Knowledge trilogy and was followed by Doctor Mirabilis and both Black Easter and The Day After Judgment (two novellas that Blish viewed as together forming the third volume of the trilogy). Few science fiction stories of the time attempted religious themes, and still fewer did this with Catholicism. ==Plot== ===Part 1=== In 2049, Father Ramon Ruiz- Sanchez of Peru, Clerk Regular of the Society of Jesus, is a member of a four- man team of scientists sent to the planet Lithia to determine if it can be opened to human contact. Ruiz-Sanchez is a biologist and biochemist, and he serves as the team doctor. However, as a Jesuit, he has religious concerns as well. The planet is inhabited by a race of intelligent bipedal reptile-like creatures, the Lithians. Ruiz-Sanchez has learned to speak their language to learn about them. While on a walking survey of the land, Cleaver, a physicist, is poisoned by a plant, despite a protective suit, and he suffers badly. Ruiz- Sanchez treats him and leaves to send a message to the others: Michelis, a chemist, and Agronski, a geologist. He is helped by Chtexa, a Lithian whom he has befriended, who then invites him to his house. This is an opportunity which Ruiz-Sanchez cannot decline; no member of the team has been invited into Lithian living places before. The Lithians seem to have an ideal society, a utopia without crime, conflict, ignorance or want. Ruiz-Sanchez is awed. When the team is reassembled, they compare their observations of the Lithians. Soon they will have to officially pronounce their verdict. Michelis is open-minded and sympathetic to the Lithians. He has learned their language and some of their customs. Agronski is more insular in his outlook, but he sees no reason to consider the planet dangerous. When Cleaver revives, he reveals that he wants the place exploited, regardless of the Lithians' wishes. He has found enough pegmatite (a source of lithium, which is rare on Earth) that a factory could be set up to supply Earth with lithium deuteride for nuclear weapons. Michelis is for open trade. Agronski is indifferent. Ruiz-Sanchez makes a major declaration: he wants maximum quarantine. The information Chtexa revealed to him, added to what he already knew, convinces him that Lithia is nothing less than the work of Satan, a place deliberately constructed to show peace, logic, and understanding in the complete absence of God. Point for point, Ruiz-Sanchez lists the facts about Lithia that directly attack Catholic teaching. Michelis is mystified, but does point out that all the Lithian science he has learned, while perfectly logical, rests on highly questionable assumptions. It is as if it just came from nowhere. The team can come to no agreement. Ruiz-Sanchez concludes that Cleaver's intentions will probably prevail and Lithian society will be exterminated. Despite his conclusions about the planet, he has a deep affection for the Lithians. As the humans board their ship to leave, Chtexa gives Ruiz-Sanchez a gift—a sealed jar containing an egg. It is a son of Chtexa, to be raised on Earth and learn the ways of humans. At this point, the Jesuit solves a riddle which he has been pondering for some time, from Book III of Finnegans Wake by James Joyce (pp. 572–3), which proposes a complex case of marital morals, ending with the question "Has he hegemony and shall she submit?" To the Church, neither "Yes" nor "No" is a morally satisfactory answer. Ruiz-Sanchez sees that it is two questions, despite the omission of a comma between the two, so that the answer can be "Yes and No". ===Part 2=== The egg hatches and grows into the individual Egtverchi. Like all Lithians, he inherits knowledge from his father through his DNA. Earth society is based on the nuclear shelters of the 20th century, with most people living underground. Egtverchi is the proverbial firecracker in an anthill; he upends society and precipitates violence. Ruiz- Sanchez has to go to Rome to face judgment. His conviction about Lithia is viewed as heresy, since he believes Satan has the power to create a planet. This is close to Manichaeism. He has an audience with the Pope himself to explain his beliefs. Pope Hadrian VIII, a logically and technologically aware Norwegian, points out two things Ruiz-Sanchez missed. First, Lithia could have been a deception, not a creation. And second, Ruiz-Sanchez could have done something about it, namely, perform an exorcism on the whole planet. The priest bows his head in shame that he has overlooked an obvious solution to his own case of conscience while he was absorbed in "a book [Finnegans Wake] which to all intents and purposes might have been dictated by the Adversary himself ... 628 pages of compulsive demoniac chatter." The Pope dismisses Ruiz-Sanchez to purge his own soul and to return to the Church if and when he can. A violent mass riot breaks out, fomented by Egtverchi and made possible by the psychosis present in many of the citizens as a result of living in the 'shelter state' (an earlier reference to the "Corridor Riots of 1993" indicates that this is not the first time violence has burst out among the buried cities). During the riot, Agronski dies as a result of being stung by one or more genetically modified honey bees. Ruiz-Sanchez administers Extreme Unction, despite his almost-faithless state. Egtverchi secretly boards a spaceship to Lithia. Michelis and Ruiz-Sanchez are taken to the Moon, where a new telescope has been assembled, based on "a fundamental twist on the Haertel equations which makes it possible to see around normal space-time, as well as travel around it"Blish 1999, p. 135 so that the instrument presents a view of Lithia in real-time, bypassing the delay caused by the speed of light. Cleaver is on Lithia, setting up his reactors, but the physicist who invented the telescope technology believes he has found a fault in Cleaver's reasoning. There is a chance that the work will set off a chain reaction in the planet's rocks and destroy it. As they watch on the screen, Ruiz-Sanchez pronounces an exorcism. The planet explodes, eliminating Cleaver and Egtverchi, but also Chtexa and all the things Ruiz-Sanchez admired. It is left ambiguous whether the extinction of the Lithians is a result of Ruiz-Sanchez's prayer or Cleaver's error. ==Reception== While faulting the novel for "extreme unevenness", Galaxy reviewer Floyd C. Gale concluded that A Case of Conscience was "a provocative, serious, commendable work" and characterized it as "trailblaz[ing]"."Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf", Galaxy Magazine, February 1959, pp. 139–140. Anthony Boucher found Blish's protagonist "a credible and moving figure" and praised the opening segment; however he faulted the later material for "los[ing] focus and impact" and "wander[ing]" to an ending that seems "merely chaotic.""Recommended Reading", F&SF;, August 1958, p. 105. In his "Books" column for The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, Damon Knight selected Blish's novel as one of the ten best science fiction books of the 1950s.Damon Knight. "Books", F&SF;, April 1960, p. 99. He reviewed the novel as "resonat[ing] with a note of its own. . . . it is complete and perfect."Knight, Damon. "In the Balance", If, December 1958, pp. 108–09. On the other hand, Br. Guy Consolmagno, S.J., the director of the Vatican Observatory, suggested that this novel was written without much knowledge of Jesuits, saying that "[its] theology isn't only bad theology, it's not Jesuit theology." In a foreword, Blish mentions that he had heard objections to the theology, but countered that the theology was that of a future Church rather than the present one, and that in any case he set out to write about "not a body of faith, but a man". He also received, and quoted, the official Church policy on contact with extraterrestrial intelligent life forms. The policy described such life forms as being possibly without immortal souls, or having immortal souls and being "fallen", or having souls and existing in a state of Grace, listing the approach to be taken in each case. In 2012 the novel was included in the Library of America two-volume boxed set American Science Fiction: Nine Classic Novels of the 1950s, edited by Gary K. Wolfe. ==Awards and nominations== The novel won a Hugo Award in 1959. The original novella won a Retrospective Hugo Award in 2004. ==See also== * Arthur C.

20067619	A Case of Exploding Mangoes	A Case of Exploding Mangoes is a 2008 comic novel by the Pakistani writer Mohammed Hanif. It is based on the 1988 aircraft crash that killed Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, the sixth president of Pakistan. The book received generally positive reviews from critics. It won the Commonwealth Foundation's Best First Book prize in 2009, and was shortlisted for the Guardian First Book Award. == Plot summary == The central theme of the book is a fictitious story behind the real-life aircraft crash which killed Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, president of Pakistan from 1977 to 1988, about which there are many conspiracy theories. After witnessing a tank parade in Bahawalpur, Pakistan on August 17, 1988, Zia leaves the small Punjabi town in the C-130 Hercules aircraft designated "Pak One," along with several of his senior army officials, the US Ambassador to Pakistan Arnold Raphel, and some crates of mangoes. Shortly after a smooth takeoff, the control tower loses contact with the aircraft. Witnesses who saw the plane in the air later claim it was flying erratically, before nosediving and exploding on impact, killing all 31 on board. Zia had ruled Pakistan for 11 years prior to his death. Lazy, irreverent Ali Shigri narrates the story. Ali's father, Col. Quli Shigri, has recently died in what was called a suicide, but Ali discovers that his father was killed by a rogue ISI officer, Major Kiyani, under Zia's orders. The story takes place in the months before the plane crash, jumping back and forth between Ali's revenge plans and his third-person observations of Zia's life. Ali attends the Pakistani Air Force Academy with his fellow cadets and their instructors. His best friend is Cadet "Baby O" Obaid, his roommate and lover. Interspersed between pieces of Ali's narrative are glimpses into the lives of other key Pakistani and American political players: Chief of Pakistani Intelligence General Akhtar Abdur Rahman, American ambassador to Pakistan Arnold Raphel, and President Zia ul- Haq himself. The book also touches on the perspectives of some of Zia's closest confidants. Over the course of the book, Zia grows ever more suspicious of those in his inner circle until he is driven utterly mad by his own paranoia. Every morning, he asks his chief of security, "Who's trying to kill me?" A devout Muslim, he attends daily prayers, where he weeps loudly (an occurrence to which the other worshippers have become accustomed). He fights with his wife and takes every opportunity to leer at non-Muslim cleavage. In one subplot, General Zia sentences Zainab, a blind woman, to death by stoning for being the victim of a gang rape. Being blind, she could not identify her attackers, so according to Zia’s sharia court, she has committed adultery. For condemning her, Zainab calls down a curse upon Zia. The curse is picked up by a sugar-obsessed crow. In another subplot, Arnold Raphel holds a Fourth of July party in Islamabad. A young, bearded Saudi known as "OBL" attends. OBL works for Laden and Co. Constructions, making this a clear reference to, and a cameo by, Osama bin Laden. Ali's revenge plot consists of stabbing Zia in the eye with his under-officer sword, a move he practices daily in secret. But Baby O concocts a new plot to kill Zia by crashing a plane kamikaze-style down on him. He even goes so far as to steal a plane for the job, but in doing so, he accidentally lands Ali in prison at Lahore Fort, a torture center. While there, Ali listens to the screams of his tortured fellow prisoners and talks via a hole in the wall with the "Secretary General" who has been in solitary confinement there for nine years. Ali eventually learns that his own father is the one responsible for turning Lahore Fort into a torture center ("Nice work, Dad," he responds). Meanwhile, Major Kiyani appears on the scene, intending to torture Ali. A sudden change in ISI command takes place, and Ali is freed in time to avoid torture. Upon his arrival back at the Pakistani Air Force Academy, he learns that he has been chosen as part of the squad that will perform a silent drill salute for Zia. Ali will finally have his opportunity, and he decides to stake his revenge plot on the use of snake venom from Uncle Starchy (launderer for PAF Academy), injected into Zia's hand via Ali's sword. After the silent drill salute, Zia boards the doomed Pak One. The novel does not confirm whether or not Ali is successful in his attempt to assassinate General Zia. Rather, several alternatives are offered: the curse-carrying crow that crashed into the plane's engines while pursuing the mangoes, an explosive planted in the mangoes by the All Pakistan Sweepers Union in revenge for the death of their general-secretary at the hands of Major Kiyani, or one of Zia's confidants, each with their own secrets and motivations. The book even speculates that it could be the work of the CIA. == Themes == === Corruption === General Akhtar Abdul Rehman is the chief of ISI under General Zia. He controlled the tremendously great ISI and falls resentfully to second in importance, command, and control to General Zia ul-Haq. The ISI with its government agent systems and the measure of financing makes General Akhtar an exceptionally well-off and dangerous man. As ISI is in charge of piping the assets and weapons to the Afghan mujahideen, the book indicates that every one of these assets are not given to the mujahideen. The millions are occupied somewhere else, to people with great influence, General Akhtar chief among them. === Global politics === The book explores the seemingly self- contradictory nature of American policy in the Middle East during this time. Much time is spent discussing the joint US-Pakistan effort to support Afghan mujahideen guerilla fighters against Soviet forces in the 1980s. Hanif writes, "Would-be supporters of the jihad against the Soviets were sent cards carrying a picture of a dead Afghan child (caption: Better dead than red)." Readers are reminded that the US enthusiastically collaborated with General Zia to finance, train, and supply the Afghan mujahideen in their insurgency. It was Zia who permitted the shipment of American arms and billions of American dollars to the rebels, and who allowed the border regions of Pakistan to be used as their haven and training base. Hanif highlights the irony in America wanting to purge the world of one type of authoritarianism by cultivating another. By propping up an unhinged dictator like Zia and conspiring with violent radicals, Hanif believes that the U.S. demonstrates that it will manipulate any weaker actor it can into being a pawn in their foreign policy strategy. === Islamism === Throughout the book, Zia remains convinced he is guided by Allah and feels he is receiving ominous messages straight out of the Quran predicting his demise. During his presidency Zia was credited for the Islamization of Pakistan. He was committed to enforcing his interpretation of Nizam-e-Mustafa ("Rule of the prophet" Muhammad), i.e. to establish an Islamic state and enforce sharia law. Hanif depicts this in a negative light to expose the hypocrisies he believes are present in political Islam. == Characters == === Fictitious characters === * Under Officer Ali Shigri – protagonist, leader of "Silent Drill Squad" at Pakistan Air Force Academy, Risalpur * Major Kiyani – ISI officer who pushes Shigri to sign off that his father was a suicide (may be based on 2007-2013 Pakistan Army Chief Ashfaq Pervez Kayani, but not identical—as revealed at the novel's end) and transports Shigri between prisons * "Secretary General" – prisoner in the cell next to Ali Shigri, who claims to have been the Secretary General of the All Pakistan Sweepers Union back in the beginning of Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's era.

It first appeared in The Strand Magazine in September 1891. ==Plot summary== The story revolves around the case of Miss Mary Sutherland, a woman with a substantial income from the interest on a fund set up for her. She is engaged to a quiet Londoner who has recently disappeared. Sherlock Holmes' detective powers are barely challenged as this turns out to be quite an elementary case for him, much as it puzzles Watson. The fiancé, Hosmer Angel, is a peculiar character, rather quiet, and rather secretive about his life. Miss Sutherland only knows that he works in an office in Leadenhall Street, but nothing more specific than that. All his letters to her are typewritten, even the signature, and he insists that she write back to him through the local Post Office. The climax of the sad liaison comes when Mr. Angel abandons Miss Sutherland at the altar on their wedding day. Holmes, noting all these things, Hosmer Angel's description, and the fact that he only seems to meet with Miss Sutherland while her disapproving youngish stepfather, James Windibank, is out of the country on business, reaches a conclusion quite quickly. A typewritten letter confirms his belief beyond doubt. Only one person could have gained by this: Mr. James Windibank. Since the death of Mary Sutherland's mother he's been the trustee of Mary's inheritage, and will continue to be able to finance his lifestyle, but only until she decides to leave home. Holmes deduces "Angel" had "disappeared" by simply going out the other side of a four-wheeler cab. After solving the mystery, Holmes chooses not to tell his client the solution, since "If I tell her she will not believe me. You may remember the old Persian saying, 'There is danger for him who taketh the tiger cub, and danger also for whoso snatches a delusion from a woman.' There is as much sense in Hafiz as in Horace, and as much knowledge of the world." Holmes had earlier advised his client to forget "Mr. Angel", but Miss Sutherland refused to take Holmes' advice and vowed to remain faithful to "Angel" until he reappears – for at least ten years. Holmes predicts Windibank will continue a career in crime and end up on the gallows. ==Publication history== "A Case of Identity" was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in September 1891, and in the United States in the US edition of the Strand in October 1891.Smith (2014), p. 45. The story was published with seven illustrations by Sidney Paget in The Strand Magazine.Cawthorne (2011), p. 58. It was included in the short story collection The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in October 1892.Cawthorne (2011), p. 54. ==Adaptations== ===Film and television=== This story was the basis for the third Holmes adventure (released in 1921) in the silent Stoll film series starring Eille Norwood. In 2001, this was the basis for the last episode of the animated television series Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd Century. In 2014, it is seen in "The Empty Hearse", from the BBC television series Sherlock, as one of the cases Sherlock works on with Molly Hooper assisting him. Mary Sutherland was portrayed by Elizabeth Coyle. Molly Hooper was portrayed by Louise Brealey. In the fourth episode of the 2014 Japanese puppetry television series Sherlock Holmes, Mary Sutherland is a pupil of Beeton School. She is in love with the senior Hosmer Angel who suddenly disappears in a cave at the back of the school. Holmes, a pupil who lives in room 221B of Baker Dormitory, suspects that Angel and Windibank, one of the childhood friends of Sutherland, are the same person and he and Watson find out that there is no pupil called Hosmer Angel in the school. Holmes appreciates Watson for consoling the broken-hearted Sutherland. Watson tells Holmes, who criticises novels as in the original story, that he is wrong to do so because various things can be learned from novels including how to understand the female mind.Shinjiro Okazaki and Kenichi Fujita (ed.), "シャーロックホームズ冒険ファンブック Shārokku Hōmuzu Boken Fan Bukku", Tokyo: Shogakukan, 2014, pp.40–42, 78–79.

The story was adapted as the beginning of the third case in the 2016 Frogwares video game Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter. Watson is not present when Mary Sutherland arrives and Sherlock is accompanied by Orson Wilde, an American actor training to play him. The player can come up with different conclusions to the case and also make a choice concerning telling her the results of his deduction. Keith R. A. Decandido's short story, "Identity: An Adventure of Shirley Holmes and Jack Watson" updates the story to modern-day Manhattan. Here, the explanation is changed from nearsightedness to prosopagnosia, or face blindness. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * * ==External links== * * * * Category:Sherlock Holmes short stories by Arthur Conan Doyle Category:Fiction set in 1887 Category:1891 short stories Category:Works originally published in The Strand Magazine Category:Short stories adapted into films

2629149	A Case of Need	A Case of Need is a medical thriller/mystery novel written by Michael Crichton, his fourth novel and the only under the pseudonym Jeffery Hudson. It was first published in 1968 by The World Publishing Company (New York) and won an Edgar Award in 1969. The novel was adapted into the 1972 film The Carey Treatment, and the book was re-released in 1993 under Crichton's own name. The novel tackles the issues of abortion and racism as they were in late 1960s America. ==Plot summary== Dr. John Berry, the protagonist, is a pathologist working in Boston during the 1960s, a time when abortion was illegal in the United States. The story opens with an introduction of the various requirements and challenges of the medical profession during the era. Subsequently, Dr. Berry is notified that his friend, an obstetrician named Arthur Lee, has been arrested and accused of performing an illegal abortion that led to the death of Karen Randall, a member of a prominent Boston medical dynasty. Berry does not believe the allegations, but the situation is further complicated by the fact that Lee is already well-known within the medical community as an abortion provider and that Berry has in the past helped Lee disguise medical samples to hide the fact that Lee's dilation and curettage patients were pregnant. After visiting his friend in jail, Berry sets out to prove Lee's innocence. He investigates the personal life of the dead woman, creating an accurate portrait of her past, psychology, and character. During his search, which lasts several days, vandals attack Lee's home. The protagonist's knowledge of medicine and law are helpful in overcoming various barriers in his search, including a hostile police captain and bribes from the scion of the Randall family itself: Karen's father, a well-established (though mediocre) doctor. Eventually, with the aid of an unscrupulous lawyer named Wilson, Berry is able to obtain solid evidence showing Karen Randall's uncle (who had already performed three previous abortions for her) to be the culprit. Nonetheless, Berry is troubled by this conclusion and continues his investigation despite Wilson's displeasure. Eventually, he discovers that Karen's drug-dealing friends, Roman and Angela, performed the botched abortion, but Berry is attacked and sent to the hospital before he can reveal his discovery. Subsequently, Berry's attacker, who turns out to be Karen's African-American boyfriend, is also brought in an ambulance, dead after a fatal fall. The actual abortion care provider attempts to commit suicide. Berry forces her to confess in the hospital by threatening her with what she believes is an excruciatingly painful dose of Nalorphine (but is actually water). Berry continues to be suspicious about Karen's boyfriend's death, and ultimately forces one of his old friends and colleagues (the uncle of the woman who did Karen's abortion) to admit to his involvement before turning him in to the police. However, despite being proven innocent, Lee's reputation has been ruined, and he decides to move to California. The novel ends with several appendices describing some lesser-known aspects of the medical profession and a postscript discussing current problems in medicine, including abortion. ==Background== Crichton had published several novels under the pseudonym John Lange but felt since this one was more serious than the Lange books it needed to come out under a different name. He planned to write further Jeffrey Hudson books about medical fiction, but this did not come about. The pen name Jeffrey Hudson came from the name of a dwarf in the time of King Charles I of England, who was served to the monarch in a pie and later captured by Barbary Pirates. The novel was republished in hardcover under Crichton's name in 1993. Crichton was furious at this, called the action "despicable", and said it misled the public into thinking it was a new novel. ==References== Category:1968 American novels Category:American mystery novels Category:American thriller novels Category:American novels adapted into films Category:Edgar Award-winning works Category:English-language novels Category:Novels about abortion Category:Novels by Michael Crichton Category:Novels set in Boston Category:Works published under a pseudonym
5632768	A Case of Rape	A Case of Rape is a 1974 American made-for-television drama film directed by Boris Sagal and starring Elizabeth Montgomery, Ronny Cox, and William Daniels. It premiered on NBC on February 20, 1974. The film tells the story of a wife and mother who is raped twice by the same man and her ordeals dealing with the actual rape and her subsequent dealing with the police and the trial. ==Plot== Ellen Harrod appears to have a happy marriage to David, although his frequent work-related absences are beginning to take a toll on her. While taking night school classes with her neighbor and best friend, Marge Bracken, she is introduced to Larry Retzliff. Ellen and Marge accept a ride home from Retzliff the same night while David is away. Once Ellen is in her apartment, Retzliff arrives claiming car trouble and asks to use the phone. When Ellen lets him in, he overpowers and rapes her. Unable to reach David by phone, and emotionally unable to report the crime, Ellen decides to put the attack behind her, and tries through three showers to literally wash away the rape. When David returns, she is still unable to get his attention long enough to tell him about the attack. Having had an anonymous blood test, Ellen makes a serious effort to forget the attack and resume her life. This attempt comes to a crashing halt four days after the initial attack in a parking garage when Retzliff, who has been waiting for Ellen behind the front seat of her car, rapes her again, this time beating her viciously. After reporting the attack, the treatment that Ellen receives from the police, doctors, and detectives is anything but sympathetic. While the District Attorney, Leonard Alexander, appears to have her best interests at heart, he clearly has his reservations. Defending Retzliff is ruthless attorney Muriel Dyer who bullies and interrogates witnesses and Ellen herself on the stand in an attempt to get Retzliff off. Dyer's efforts succeed and Retzliff is found not guilty. Following the trial, attorney Alexander comments, "Never try a rape case unless your victim is a 90-year-old nun with at least four stab wounds." After this, Retzliff mockingly apologizes to Ellen, saying "no hard feelings", but Ellen calmly but coldly tells him, "If you ever come near me again, I'll kill you." A voiceover narration at the end of the movie reveals that shortly after the trial, Retzliff attempts to rape someone else. While trying to escape from the police, he is shot and wounded, and ends up pleading guilty to the rape and sentenced to prison. Ellen and David's marriage is strained by the events of the film, and the narration reveals that Ellen later files for divorce. ==Cast== *Elizabeth Montgomery as Ellen Harrod *Ronny Cox as David Harrod *William Daniels as Leonard Alexander / Narrator *Cliff Potts as Larry Retzliff *Rosemary Murphy as Muriel Dyer *Patricia Smith as Marge Bracken *Ken Swofford as Detective Riley *Jonathan Lippe as Detective Parker *Sandy Kenyon as Mike Bracken *Alex Henteloff as Alex *Robert Karnes as Judge *Mario Gallo as Photographer *Antony Carbone as Officer Carbone *Davis Roberts as Officer Kane *Tom Selleck as Stan ==Broadcast== The film was broadcast on February 20, 1974, over the NBC Television Network, which had some reservations about showing the second rape scene, which was considered strongly graphic at the time. As reported by the A&E; series Biography, Montgomery believed so strongly in the story that she threatened to leave the project if the scene was cut. Montgomery prevailed, and the film was shown in its entirety along with warnings of the mature subject matter. This was the second issue-oriented TV-movie of its time, following the 1973 CBS tv film Cry Rape starring Andrea Marcovicci, and helped to change human rights and legislation for rape victims. It was NBC's highest rated TV-movie in history with a Nielsen rating of 33.1 and an audience share of 49%.Wagner, Joyce (6 March 1974).

7214270	A Case of Spring Fever	A Case of Spring Fever is a 1940 American short industrial film produced by the Jam Handy Organization for Chevrolet. The black-and-white film is partially animated, partially live-action. It follows the story of Gilbert, a man whose wish that he never sees a spring again is granted by Coily the Spring Sprite, who makes springs vanish. ==Plot== Gilbert's wife phones his golfing buddies to tell them that he won't be able to join them today, as he is stuck at home repairing the springs in his couch. Frustrated, Gilbert fumes that he never wants to see another spring "as long as I live," prompting the appearance of Coily, a "spring sprite." Coily brusquely grants Gilbert's wish, and removes all springs from his life. Initially relieved at no longer having to fix the couch, Gilbert quickly finds that he is unable to use most of the devices in his home, including his pocket watch, window blinds, rotary phone, and even his car, all of which rely on springs for their functionality. Every time Gilbert attempts to use a spring-based device, Coily taunts him with the phrase, "No springs!" Gilbert begs Coily to let him retract his wish, which Coily does, on the condition that Gilbert never wish away springs again. Gilbert joins his friends at the golf course, talking endlessly about the benefits of springs. He astutely explains the mechanics of a spring and provides various examples of devices, processes, and physical reactions for which springs are necessary. Gilbert's friends become bored, then irritated, at his pontificating. At length, Gilbert is forced to stop one of the men from making the same anti-spring wish that he once made, and Coily briefly reappears to laugh. ==Analysis== Though a documentary, A Case of Spring Fever eschews some features typical of the genre, instead dramatizing its events and introducing a supernatural character. It also has a parodic or mockumentary character; Gilbert is a comic figure who is infantilized by his wife and subsequently bores his friends. Nonetheless, Gilbert's claims about springs are presented as factual. For Donald Levin, "the film's use of the codes and conventions of the documentary work to increase our understanding about our shared social world, and at the same time critique and parody Gilbert's (and, by extension, its own) attempt to communicate that understanding". ==Legacy== A Case of Spring Fever was parodied in "Bart the Lover", a season three episode of The Simpsons, in which an educational film about zinc includes a supernatural being who makes all zinc disappear. The film was also the subject of mockery in the 12th episode of the tenth season of Mystery Science Theater 3000 alongside the 1976 horror film Squirm. Chris Morgan called the short film "a worthy choice for the final short [featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000], a strange film with an even stranger premise". It was also spoofed on RiffTrax October 23, 2014.RiffTrax ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * * *A Case of Spring Fever at the National Film Preservation Foundation *MST3K version on ShoutFactoryTV Category:1940 short films Category:1940 animated films Category:1940 documentary films Category:Sponsored films Category:Chevrolet Category:Jam Handy Organization films Category:Springs (mechanical) Category:1940 films Category:American black-and-white films Category:1940s short documentary films Category:American short documentary films Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Short films with live action and animation Category:Films about fairies and sprites Category:1940s American films
21990161	A Case of Two Cities	A Case of Two Cities is Qiu Xiaolong's fourth Inspector Chen novel (after 2004's When Red Is Black). Character, poetry, insights into Chinese society and culture, and food all come before story in this crime novel. ==Plot summary== Inspector Chen Cao of the Shanghai Police Department is assigned a high-profile anti-corruption case, one in which the principal figure has long since fled to the United States and beyond the reach of the Chinese government. But he left behind the organization and his partners-in-crime, and Inspector Chen is charged to uncover those responsible and act as necessary to end the corruption ring though he is not sure whether he's actually being set up to fail. The investigation takes him from Shanghai all the way to the U.S. where he meets his colleague and counterpart from the U.S. Marshall's Service, Inspector Catherine Rhon. ==Literary Review== There's something especially brave and noble about a cop who perseveres under difficult circumstances. Readers who love China will be heartened, as this gritty, suspenseful tale unfolds, to discover that Inspector Chen is far from alone in his quest to build a humane Chinese society. The Washington Post - Richard Lipez Hidden under the surface of the crime novel are some observations by the author. Qiu comments through his tale about the changing scape of China's economy and how new crime and corruption are rising with the general prosperity of China. He also shows many cultural differences that are created or perhaps only now noticed as China changes her economic status and how these simple differences can create hostility. The author also illustrated how cultural differences may lead to hostility or bad feelings, for example, when the Chinese delegation find no water bottles for tea in their hotel rooms when visiting the US for the first time, as opposed to China, where there would be water bottles in each hotel room for tea. Therefore, the absence of hot water bottles is an oversight and is equal to an insult. From the American perceptive, a hot water bottle is not a standard requirement item in the hotel room, as offering tea to your guests is not a standard for the Americans. ==References== Category:2006 American novels Category:Novels by Qiu Xiaolong Category:Novels set in China Category:Novels set in the United States Category:Minotaur Books books

Although his novelization of the blockbuster film Teen Vampire is popular, he does not want to write the other novelizations despite encouragement from his agent, Alan. Sam suffers from writer's block with his own work. He becomes is infatuated with Birdie, a street artist and barista at the local coffee shop, but does not know how to meet her. After his roommate, Eliot, suggests checking Birdie's Facebook profile, Sam decides to pretend that he shares the interests she lists on her profile. He begins to learn how to play the guitar and cook French cuisine, and buys books by Walt Whitman and songs by Joan Baez. After pretending to accidentally meet at a comedy club Birdie mentioned online the two become friends and partners at a ballroom-dance class, and Sam begins to write a novel based on their relationship. To spend more time with her Sam pretends to share Birdie's other interests, including pedicures and bourbon. They begin to fall in love, and Birdie accompanies Sam, Eliot, and Eliot's girlfriend, Ashley, to a spiritual retreat where they sleep together for the first time. Although Sam enjoys spending time with Birdie he finds participating in her many interests to be difficult, and is intimidated by her skill in such areas as caricature, singing, and rock climbing. After Birdie tells Sam that she loves him and mentions her parents' plan to attend their impending dance recital, an insecure Sam discourages her interest in him. At a pitch meeting, Alan and another agent praise Sam's novel as a superb portrayal of a pathetic "eunuch" who, after foolishly breaking up with his girlfriend, is doomed to remain alone. Realizing that he has made a mistake, Sam rushes to the recital where Birdie is about to perform with another partner. He states his love for her and confesses to using her Facebook profile to adjust his public persona. She tells him that she knew all the time, even adding items to see whether he would respond.

Metacritic gives the film a score of 38 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating "generally unfavorable reviews". Andy Webster of The New York Times states in his review, "While this unrelentingly midtempo movie milks Brooklyn for its chic, it manages to denude it of its color. A moment of dramatic anger from Sam feels forced and abrupt, while — surprise — the climax involves a dash to a joyous reunion. The filmmakers sought the rights to Joni Mitchell's classic song 'A Case of You'; to her credit, she wouldn't hand them over, perhaps because the tune is imbued with deep, honest feelings." Dennis Harvey of Variety wrote, "A lot of interesting, funny performers aren't very interesting or funny [...] this surprisingly bland indie version of the generic mainstream romantic comedy has talent to burn, none of it put to good use. It’s not awful, but the paucity of fresh ideas or humor makes this overly safe first writing effort for all three scribes innocuous to the point of instant forgettability." ==Release== A Case of You premiered at the 2013 Tribeca Film Festival and was released by IFC Films on video on demand platforms as well as in a limited theatrical release on November 8, 2013. It was released on DVD on February 4, 2014. ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2013 films Category:2013 romantic comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:Films about writers Category:Films directed by Kat Coiro Category:Films set in New York City Category:Films shot in New York City Category:IFC Films films Category:2010s English-language films Category:2010s American films Category:English-language romantic comedy films
69185349	A Case of You (horse)	A Case of You, (foaled 27 March 2018) is an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse. He showed high class form as a two-year-old in 2020 when he won two of his three races included the Group 3 Anglesey Stakes. In the following year he improved to become a leading sprinter, winning the Lacken Stakes and running second in the Flying Five Stakes before taking the Group 1 Prix de l'Abbaye. He won the Al Quoz Sprint in 2022. ==Background== A Case of You is a bay colt with a white star bred in Ireland by Limestone and Tara Studs. In October 2019 the colt was consigned to the Goffs Sportsman's Yearling Sale but failed to reach his reserve price of €3,000. He was subsequently acquired by John C McConnell who took the horse into training at Stamullen, County Meath. The horse shares his name with a song by Joni Mitchell. He was from the second crop of foals sired by Hot Streak, a sprinter who won the Cornwallis Stakes in 2013 and the Temple Stakes in 2014. A Case of You's dam Karjera showed little racing ability, failing to win in eight starts. She was a female-line descendant of the California-bred broodmare Amerigo's Fancy, making her a distant relative of Makybe Diva and Canford Cliffs. ==Racing career== ===2020: two-year-old season=== A Case of You began his racing career in a one mile maiden race at Bellewstown on 26 August when he started at odds of 15/2 and finished third behind Win Win Fighter, beaten four and a half lengths by the winner. In a maiden over seven furlongs on heavy ground at Down Royal nine days later he was ridden by Colin Keane and recorded his first success as he took the lead approaching the final furlong and won "comfortably" by two and a half lengths from Earls Rock. On 11 October at the Curragh the colt was stepped up in class but dropped in distance for the Group 3 Anglesey Stakes over six and a half furlongs and went off the 6/1 third choice in the betting behind the Aidan O'Brien-trained contenders Preamble and Lippizaner. Ridden by Gary Carroll, A Case of You disputed the lead from the start, gained the advantage at half way and stayed on well in the closing stages to win by one and a quarter lengths from Lippizaner. John McConnell commented "Usually if I have a good horse I stay away from the Curragh because the competition is so good but he justified coming here and was impressive. It's my first Group winner on the Flat... He's my own and I'd love to sell him. It would be great to sell him and stay in the yard. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets faster and faster and the dream could be something like a Commonwealth Cup." ===2021: three-year-old season=== Before the start of the 2021 season A Case Of You was bought by Gary Devlin and transferred to the training stable of Adrian McGuinness at Lusk, County Dublin. On his first appearance for his new connections, the colt started 10/11 favourite for a minor race over six furlongs on the synthetic polytrack surface at Dundalk Stadium on 19 March. Ridden by Ronan Whelan he took the lead approaching and went clear of his opponents to win "readily" by three and three quarter lengths from Logo Hunter. In the following month A Case of You started favourite for the Listed 2,000 Guineas Trial Stakes over seven furlongs Leopardstown Racecourse but after being in contention for most of the way he hung badly to the right in the straight and came home last of the twelve runners behind. Poetic Flare. Whelan was again in the saddle when A Case of You contested the Group 3 Lacken Stakes over six furlongs at Naas Racecourse on 16 May and started second choice in the betting his old rival Lippizaner. In a rough race, A Case of You tracked the leaders before finishing strongly and prevailed in a blanket finish by a neck, a head and a neck from Mooneista, Power Under Me and Laws of Indices. The placings of the second and third placed finishers were reversed after a stewards' inquiry. Adrian McGuiness commented "We gave him a break after Leopardstown where we were a bit disappointed with him. He pulled hard that day and we said we’d drop him back to sprinting. Obviously that is his forte, he had to dig deep there today and he’s tough. I think he’ll improve a little bit as I haven’t been very hard on him." A Case of You moved to the highest level for the Group 1 Commonwealth Cup at Royal Ascot in June but finished eleventh of the fifteen runners after losing a shoe in the race. Victory went to the American filly Campanelle when the first place finisher Dragon Symbol was disqualified. Following a break of over seven weeks, the colt returned in the Group 3 Phoenix Sprint Stakes over six furlongs at the Curragh on 8 August when he was matched against older horses and came home third behind the five-year-old Gustavus Weston. On 5 September at the Curragh A Case of You started a 33/1 outsider when he was dropped back in distance for the Group 1 Flying Five Stakes. Ridden by Whelan, he was towards the rear in the early stages before producing a strong late run to finish second, half a length behind the six- year-old mare Romantic Proposal. For his last start of the season in Europe A Case of You was sent to France for the Group 1 Prix de l'Abbaye over 1000 metres on heavy ground at Longchamp Racecourse on 3 October when he was partnered by Whelan and started at odds of 10.8/1. The King George Stakes winner Suesa started favourite while the other twelve runners included Glass Slippers, Winter Power, Romantic Proposal, Berneuil (Prix du Petit Couvert), Pradaro (Prix du Gros Chene), Dandalla (Duchess of Cambridge Stakes) and Air de Valse (2020 Prix du Petit Couvert). A Case of You raced in mid-division before coming under pressure at half way and then began to make progress 300 metres from the finish. The five-year-old mare Air de Valse had opened up a clear advantage but the Irish colt maintained his run, caught the leader on the line and won by a short head. After the race McGuinness said "The Flying Five was his first time over five furlongs and he's just got better and better. He'll be a very good horse next year... I ran him at Ascot and he wasn't right, but I knew he was right here. I can't believe it. I knew he'd definitely improved because I've a good sprinter at home and he can't lay up with him. He's coped with the ground, but I think he'll be better on good. We're definitely going to look at the Breeders' Cup, but we'll see how he is." As McGuinness had suggested, A Case of You ended his season with a trip to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint over five furlongs at Del Mar Racetrack on November 6. Racing on firm ground he raced in mid-division before staying on in the straight but never looked likely to win and came home fifth behind Golden Pal. ==Pedigree== ==References== Category:2018 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Ireland Category:Racehorses trained in Ireland Category:Thoroughbred family 9-f
1369078	A Case of You (song)	"A Case of You" is a song by Joni Mitchell, from her 1971 album Blue. ==Writing and recording== Mitchell wrote "A Case of You" in or before 1970. As with many of the songs on her album Blue, it might have been inspired by her relationship with Graham Nash. It is also claimed that it is about Leonard Cohen. She performed the song at the Amchitka Greenpeace benefit concert in October 1970. She recorded the song in 1971, and it was released on the 1971 album Blue with Mitchell playing Appalachian dulcimer, accompanied by James Taylor on acoustic guitar, which was tuned to standard tuning, (EADGBE), although there are cover versions played in an open G tuning (DGDGBD). Mitchell's earliest public performances of "A Case of You" contain six lines that had changed by the time Blue was recorded. The line "I am as constant as a northern star" is an allusion to Caesar's "I am constant as the Northern Star" from the Shakespeare play Julius Caesar, while the quoted line "Love is touching souls" is inspired by the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke.Chiasson, Dan (October 2, 2017). Touching Souls: Joni Mitchell’s lessons in love The New Yorker. "A Case of You" was also released as the B-side of "California". ==Personnel== According to the liner notes: * James Taylor – guitar * Russ Kunkel – drums * Joni Mitchell – production, Appalachian dulcimer, guitar, vocals * Henry Lewy – engineer * Gary Burden – art direction * Tim Considine – cover photography ==Additional recordings and performances== Mitchell later re-recorded the song for her live album Miles of Aisles (1974), as well as her orchestral album Both Sides Now (2000). She performed it regularly on her 1983 tour. The original recording was included on Mitchell's compilation Misses (1996). A demo recording was included on the 50th anniversary EP of Blue in 2021. ==Awards and accolades== In 2011, Mitchell was voted the No. 1 female artist and "A Case of You" the No. 1 female song by listeners of BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. In 2021, it was listed at No. 26 on Rolling Stone's "Top 500 Best Songs of All Time". ==Cover versions== There are well over 300 known recordings of "A Case of You". Tori Amos released a recording of the song on her 1994 single, Cornflake Girl. Jane Monheit covered the song for her 2001 album Come Dream with Me. Diana Krall covered the song on her 2001 album Live in Paris. Prince covered the song on his 2002 album One Nite Alone.... The cabaret singer Connie Champagne recorded "A Case of You" in the persona of Judy Garland on her 2003 album Imagine Judy Garland: An Evening with Connie Champagne. k.d. lang covered the song on her 2004 album Hymns of the 49th Parallel, a tribute to her favourite Canadian songwriters. The English singer/songwriter James Blake covered Mitchell's song for his EP Enough Thunder (2011). Samples of the cover were then used in the tracks "Tep and the Logic" and "You Know Your Youth", which appeared on the deluxe edition of his eponymous debut album. In 2012 the Portuguese singer Ana Moura recorded a cover version for her album Desfado produced by Mitchell's former husband and producer Larry Klein. In 2013 James Wolpert performed "A Case of You" during the Live Playoffs of The Voice. His cover reached the Top 10 of the iTunes Top 200 Singles Chart.

In 2021, actor Noah Reid performed a cover version of "A Case of You" in a video to honour his Schitt's Creek costar, Catherine O'Hara, who had received a Canadian Governor General's Award for excellence in the performing arts. ==Soundtrack appearances== The song appears in the films Truly, Madly, Deeply, Practical Magic, Clickbait (cover) and Waking the Dead. Mitchell declined, however, to grant permission to use the song in the 2013 film A Case of You. Truly, Madly, Deeply, writer-director Anthony Minghella's first film, marked the first appearance of "A Case of You" in a narrative film; the stars, Juliet Stevenson and Alan Rickman, sing the first verse and chorus of the song to each other, leading directly to the titular dialogue, "I truly, madly, deeply love you". The song was both referenced and featured in a 1996 episode of the medical drama Chicago Hope, in which Dr. Diane Grad (Jayne Brook) mentions that Mitchell's Blue album was a personal favorite of hers while growing up, and that "A Case of You" was her favorite song on the album. Mitchell's recording of the song later played over the episode's closing credits. In 2013 the song was featured in "In Dreams Begin Responsibilities", the fourth episode of the fifth season of NBC's Parenthood. One of the main characters, Drew, is pursuing a girl who mentions she loves the song. Drew tries to learn as much about Joni Mitchell as he can, only to find out that the girl only knows "A Case Of You" because it was in a movie. ==References== Category:1970 songs Category:Joni Mitchell songs Category:Songs written by Joni Mitchell Category:Prince (musician) songs Category:James Blake (musician) songs Category:Song recordings produced by Joni Mitchell

66054769	A Castle for Christmas	A Castle for Christmas is a 2021 American Christmas romantic comedy film directed by Mary Lambert. The film was released on November 26, 2021, by Netflix. ==Premise== The story follows best-selling American author Sophie Brown, who travels to Scotland to escape the scandal of her last book. She visits the ancestral village of her father, whose own father worked as a groundskeeper at the estate of a nearby castle. While there, she ends up falling in love with the castle, Dun Dunbar, but must also face off with the ill-tempered duke who owns it. ==Cast== ==Production== Dalmeny House, a Gothic Revival mansion to the north-west of Edinburgh, was used as the location for the film's Dun Dunbar Castle. Tantallon Castle was also used as a filming location. Parts of the film were also shot in South Queensferry. The village of Culross in Fife was used to portray the village of Dunbar. The music in the film features the song "Celtic Heart" by Glasgow band Starsky & the Fox. ==Reception== The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of , with an average score of , based on reviews. Writing for Variety, Courtney Howard called the film "gently disarming, heartening, holiday-themed escapism" and that it kept "genre-patented shenanigans and hijinks to a bare minimum, which is both a blessing and a curse." Writing for The Guardian, Jenny Colgan said there was "no jeopardy in this film at all: it is absolutely perfect for low-maintenance Christmas viewing" and that it was "lovely to see two great-looking actors who aren’t in the full flush of youth falling for one another." Gabriella Geisinger of Digital Spy said that the actors "manage to imbue their characters with a believable earnestness that belies the over cheese" and noted that the film was "mostly devoid of any socio-political landscape, which is a bit odd when a film is built on a system as controversial as aristocracy." The National said that the "main characters are obnoxious, the class politics are extremely dubious and the portrayal of rural village life incredibly patronising," but that "if you haven’t watched Cary Elwes try to catch fake snowflakes on his tongue, you haven’t lived." The imitations of Scottish accents and use of Scottish words and terms also met with mixed reactions. ==See also== * List of Christmas films ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2021 films Category:2021 romantic comedy films Category:2020s Christmas comedy films Category:2020s English-language films Category:American Christmas comedy films Category:American romantic comedy films Category:English-language Netflix original films Category:Films about writers Category:Films directed by Mary Lambert Category:Films scored by Jeff Rona Category:Films set in castles Category:Films set in Scotland Category:Films shot in Edinburgh Category:2020s American films

It was recorded at Aladdin Studios, mixed by Alex Proctor, and engineered and produced by Bryan Steenerson.

A review by John Ziegler in Duluth News Tribune says, "combining the zestiness of gypsy swing with the somber tones of some Eastern European folk music[,] there's a definite minor key vibe that comingles with the lyrics' darker shades lending a very distinct flavor to A Cat Named Murzik." He describes the opening track "Poison Tears" as blending "a flamenco feel with driving percussion and featur[ing] an undulating middle section, following the first verses, that almost stops time." ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Christopher Becknell – violin *Alex Budrow – drums *Ryan Pfeiffer – cello *Nathan Simar – accordion *Bryan Steenerson – vocals and guitar *Darin Steenerson – bass ;Additional musicians *Jeremy Grace – piano *Alex Proctor – bass ==References== ;Citations ;Bibliography * * * * * Category:2012 albums Category:Folk albums by American artists Category:Mint 400 Records albums
34482077	A Cat in Paris	A Cat in Paris () is a 2010 animated adventure crime film by the French 2D animation studio Folimage, telling the story of a young Parisian girl whose cat leads her to unravel a thrilling mystery over the course of a single evening. The film was directed by Alain Gagnol and Jean-Loup Felicioli. A Cat in Paris was first screened on 15 October 2010 at the Saint-Quentin Ciné-Jeune Film Festival. It was released in French theaters on 15 December 2010. International distribution is by Films Distribution, Paris. The film was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature. ==Plot== A black cat with red stripes leads a double life. During the night, he accompanies a burglar named Nico (who calls him Mr. Cat), who performs heists to steal jewels. During the day, he lives with a girl named Zoé (who calls him Dino). Zoé, who lost her voice after the loss of her father, has become distant from her mother Jeanne who works as a police superintendent, and is looked after by a lady named Claudine. Nico gives Dino a fish-shaped bracelet, which he passes on to Zoé. At the police station Jeanne briefs her colleagues on protecting the Colossus of Nairobi statue, which cost her husband his life at the hands of the notorious Victor Costa. Victor Costa intends to have another go at the statue while it is being moved, with help from his codenamed accomplices, M. Bébé (Mr. Baby), M. Hulot, M. Grenouille (Mr. Frog), and M. Patate (Mr. Potato). Back at home, Jeanne takes interest in the fish-shaped bracelet and brings it to her colleague Lucas. Lucas deduces that the bracelet matches up with burgled items from Rue Mouffetard. Zoé sneaks out of her house and follows Dino. She spies Victor's lot, and finds Claudine is working for Victor and has been gaining insight on police movements. Zoé is spotted, but is rescued by Nico. Nico takes Zoé to hide in the zoo, but Victor's gang pick up her trail. Fortunately Zoé escapes in a boat. Lucas finds a lead on the robberies trailing directly to Nico's residence. When Nico returns to find Zoé at his place, he is arrested by Jeanne and Lucas, presumably having kidnapped Zoé. Jeanne leaves Zoé in Claudine's custody and goes with Lucas to find Victor. Unable to convince Jeanne and Lucas of Zoé's predicament, Nico escapes in order to find Zoé. Jeanne is able to confirm that Nico's claim about Zoé is true. Claudine has taken Zoé to Costa's house, where she is locked away. Thanks to Claudine's perfume, Dino follows the scent and leads Nico to the house. Nico is able to whisk Zoé away after he cuts the power and dons his night goggles. Victor pursues Nico and Zoé to Notre Dame. Nico falls while trying to mislead Victor, but is saved by Jeanne, who has just arrived at the scene. As Victor captures Zoé, Jeanne, with Nico and Dino, come to the rescue. Nico has to save Dino when Victor pushes the cat over the edge of a nearby crane, leaving Jeanne to confront Victor. Plucking up her courage, Jeanne saves her daughter and strikes Victor, putting him in a hallucinatory trance. Before Jeanne can help Victor, the gang leader swings from the crane to what he imagines is the Colossus of Nairobi, but falls to his death to a truck below. The rest of the gang, including Claudine, are arrested and Zoé regains her voice. Nico reforms himself, gives up thievery, and becomes a member of the family, while Dino becomes the household pet.

It also has a score of 63 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 20 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Prior to the Oscar nomination, the film was little-seen in the United States, although it screened at a few children's film festivals. The New York Times called it "a gorgeous hand-drawn feature that is one of the highlights of this festival. ... Without being too frightening, it projects a sense of danger, both physical and emotional, that is more engaging than the high-pitched thrills of the domestic films." Time Out Chicago Kids gave the film four out of five stars, describing how "this cartoon noir distills Hitchcock into 64 brisk minutes for middle-schoolers and up"; the review elaborated that the film "announces its retro visual style with a dynamic title sequence that zips across the screen, bursting with Saul Bass-influenced dynamism." It also noted that, despite the title given to the film in English-speaking countries, "its French title, Une Vie de Chat, translates as A Cat's Life." ==See also== * The Aristocats * Gay Purr-ee ==References== ==External links== * * * * * * Category:2010 films Category:2010 animated films Category:2010s crime comedy films Category:2010s French animated films Category:French crime comedy films Category:Dutch animated films Category:Swiss animated films Category:Swiss comedy films Category:Belgian animated films Category:Belgian comedy films Category:2010s French-language films Category:Dutch crime comedy films Category:Animated films set in Paris Category:French detective films Category:Dutch detective films Category:Swiss detective films Category:Belgian detective films Category:2010s children's animated films Category:French animated comedy films Category:Folimage films Category:Animated films about cats Category:2010 comedy films Category:French-language Swiss films Category:2010s French films

It is based on Jun'ichirō Tanizaki's 1936 novella A Cat, a Man, and Two Women. ==Plot== Kitchenware salesman Shōzō shows more affection for his cat Lily than for the people around him. When his disgruntled wife Shinako moves out, his mother Orin, who never got along with her daughter-in-law, encourages him to marry Fukuko, the young daughter of Shōzō's wealthy uncle Nakajima. Fukuko is soon enervated by her future husband's obsessive love for his cat. Shinako talks Fukuko into giving Lily to her, speculating that the couple will fall out with each other over the cat's absence, and that Shōzō will eventually take Shinako back. Although Shōzō and Fukuko do separate after repeated quarrels, he refuses to re-unite with Shinako. Thrown out of his home by Fukuko, whose father paid the mortgage for the house, he walks along the rainy beach, his cat in his arms. ==Cast== * Hisaya Morishige as Shōzō * Isuzu Yamada as Shinako * Kyōko Kagawa as Fukuko * Chieko Naniwa as Orin, Shōzō's mother * Juro Hayashida as Nakajima * Ashinoya Gangyoku as Kinoshita * Kyū Sazanka as Soeyama * Haruo Tanaka as Hagimura * Michiyo Tamaki as Tamiko * Yuko Minami as Hatsuko * Katsue Miyakoya as Matsu ==Reception== In his 1959 compendium The Japanese Film – Art and Industry, film historian Donald Richie called A Cat, Shozo, and Two Women "warm, moving, and awfully funny, a winning combination of comedy and impeccable taste". ==Awards== Isuzu Yamada received the Kinema Junpo Award for Best Actress, the Mainichi Film Award for Best Actress and the Blue Ribbon Award for Best Actress.

26199172	A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian
Library	A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library (cited as Bod-inc.Alan Coates, et al., A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. lxxxvii.) is a short-title catalogue of more than 5,600 incunabula held in the Bodleian Library at the University of Oxford. Bod-inc. stands out among incunabula catalogues for its detailed listing of the contents of each edition being described. It was published on 7 July 2005 by Oxford University Press in six volumes. ==History== L. A. Sheppard began work on a catalogue of Bodleian incunabula in 1955 but he left Oxford in 1971 before the work could be completed; his slip catalogue was bound into seven volumes and served as a base of information for the Bod-inc. project.Alan Coates, et al., A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. lxx–lxxii. In the mid-1980s, Kristian Jensen, as the Bodleian Library's specialist in early printed books, decided that a new catalogue was needed and that its descriptions should follow the standards of detail expected in catalogues of medieval manuscripts.Alan Coates, et al., A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. lxxii. Early in the project, Jensen was assisted by Bettina Wagner and Alan Coates beginning in 1992. Work on Bod-inc. was undertaken over the thirteen-year period between January 1992 and January 2005 by a team of cataloguers. From 1992 to 1999, Jensen headed the cataloguing team; he was succeeded by Alan Coates who headed the project from 2000 to its completion, during which time Jensen served as a consultant.Alan Coates, et al., A Catalogue of Books Printed in the Fifteenth Century now in the Bodleian Library (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), p. xiii.

11984610	A Catalogue of Crime	A Catalogue of Crime is a critique of crime fiction by Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor, first published in 1971. The book was awarded a Special Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in 1972. A revised and enlarged edition was published in 1989. Barzun and Taylor both graduated in the class of 1924 from Harrisburg Technical High School. ==Purpose== In the preface to the 1989 second edition of A Catalogue of Crime, Jacques Barzun credits the contributions of Wendell Hertig Taylor, who died in November 1985. "He had finished, I am happy to say, his half of the substantive work [and] is therefore as fully co-author of this edition as of the first. Had he lived, it would have appeared much sooner." ==Layout== The work contains 952 pages. It is divided as follows: *Part I Novels of Detection, Crime, Mystery, and Espionage (pages 1–566) *Part II Short Stories, Collections, Anthologies, Magazines, Pastiches, and Plays (pages 569-698) *Part III Studies and Histories of the Genre, Lives of Writers, and the Literature of "Edwin Drood" (pages 701-754) *Part IV True Crime: Trials, Narratives of Cases, Criminology and Police Science, Espionage and Cryptography (pages 757-858) *Part V The Literature of Sherlock Holmes : Studies and Annotations of the Tales, Nonfiction Parodies, and Critical Pastiches (pages 859-874) ===Entries=== The book contains a total of 5,045 entries sorted, in each of the sections, in alphabetical order by the author's last name; where there is more than one entry for an author, each is in alphabetical order of the name of the work. Some entries are very short (one might say curt): one such—the only one for the author named—is: 1587 GRIFFIN, FRANK, Appointment with My Lady West 1946 A good opening chapter, after which everything goes to pieces. The narrator-hero always shouts and commits acts, including murder, without rhyme or reason. The "West 1946" refers to the publisher, John Westhouse Publishers, and to the year of publication. However, there are fifty-one entries for the prolific Agatha Christie. Christie wrote many other mystery stories, using several different detectives but Barzun and Taylor chose to review these only. The first entry (no. 749) for her After the Funeral, published in 1953, says in part: Not one of Agatha's best. The scheme is obvious and worked repetitiously. The last entry (no. 799) for her Why Didn't They Ask Evans?, published in 1935, contains three sentences, one of which is: The merit consists largely in Agatha's maintaining suspense about the small mystery of a name. The other forty-nine entries for Christie are quite mixed. They range in praise (or lack thereof) from: A Poirot story, and very dull... (entry no. 768, re Hickory, Dickory, Death, published in 1956) to: A triumph of her art...of motive-building. That is where A.C. is unrivaled. She knows how to make plausible the divergence between action and motive that maintains uncertainty until the physical clues...mesh with motive to disclose the culprit. (entry no. 769 re The Hollow, published in 1946). Part V The Literature of Sherlock Holmes... contains 81 entries (numbers 4965 through 5045). Included are, of course, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself, the originator of Holmes and the author of the 60 Holmes stories (56 short stories and four novelas). Also represented are a host of writers, some well-known from their works in other fields, and others little known to the general public but recognized by Sherlockian scholars as having made notable contributions to the Holmesian literature. Among the former are Isaac Asimov, the renowned science- fiction writer; the Roman Catholic clergyman Ronald Knox; and Christopher Morley, a long-time writer for the Saturday Review of Literature and author of some 50 literary works, among the best known of which are Kitty Foyle and Parnassus on Wheels; and, of course, Jacques Barzun himself. In the latter category are Dorothy Sayers, the British crime novelist (whose Lord Peter Wimsey stories are the best known); Howard Haycraft, a U.S. publishing executive whose The Art of the Mystery Story (published in 1946) is a recognized survey of the mystery genre; and Edgar Smith, a General Motors corporate executive who was one of the U.S. founders of the Baker Street Irregulars, the first organized group in the United States dedicated to the formation of local groups of Holmes aficionados around the country (called "scion societies") for the purpose of meeting regularly for the scholarly study of the Holmes adventures and to participate in such activities of other scion societies, in the United States and around the world. ==Reception== A Catalogue of Crime received a Special Edgar Award in 1972 from the Mystery Writers of America. The book won immediate praise for its sections on studies and histories of crime fiction, true crime, the Sherlock Holmes canon and stories of the supernatural, and for assembling the most complete annotated bibliography of mystery and detective fiction then known. But upon its publication and in the years since, A Catalogue of Crime has been criticized for its errors, omissions and genteel point of view. Ross Macdonald's May 1971 review for The New York Times is headed, "A study of mystery and detective fiction—massive and limited": > We are given pages of descriptions of books by such respectable but > pedestrian writers as John Rhode and Freeman Wills Crofts, while a brilliant > innovator and master of construction like Eric Ambler is represented in the > main descriptive text by two books. Graham Greene, perhaps the most > distinguished crime novelist of this century, is represented by a single > early work, "A Gun for Sale," with the thumbs-down comment, "Suspense only." > Georges Simenon has just one entry. Jorge Luis Borges, probably Poe's > greatest living literary descendant, is left out entirely. ... An even more > striking and inexplicable omission is that of Dashiell Hammett's The Glass > Key, which was Hammett's own favorite among his novels. "While any ambitious bibliographical/critical work of this scope is bound to contain errors, A Catalogue of Crime has some true honkers," wrote Kevin Burton Smith, editor of The Thrilling Detective website. "Some of the omissions are truly jaw-dropping, and some of the critiques are almost cute in their old-fashioned, damn-the-facts way. Its age is showing, more than most. ... Nonetheless, it's an important source, albeit more entertaining at this point than informative." ==References== ==External links== * Jacques Barzun and Wendell Hertig Taylor Papers, 1925–1975 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Category:1971 non-fiction books Category:Crime reference works Category:Detective fiction Category:Harper & Row books Category:Spy fiction Category:Books of literary criticism

Meanwhile, Jane's father, Tom, who owns a third-share in a taxi, agrees with one of his partners, Sam, that they will buy out the share of the third driver, Pasternak. Jane and Ralph, along with Tom and Sam, happily exclaim the virtues of partnership ("Partners"). Timing is inauspicious, since the bride's brother has just been killed in the Korean War. The couple does not want a large, expensive wedding, and Tom needs the money to buy out Pasternak. As Jane's mother Aggie announces that the upcoming wedding will be held quickly and quietly in City Hall, the neighborhood women react ("Women Chatter"). Dinner with Ralph's wealthier family leads Aggie to decide to give the couple a huge formal affair, committing her and Tom's life's savings and bereavement check to an elaborate wedding with an extensive guest list and a lavish catered reception ("Our Only Daughter"). Aggie feels guilty about having neglected Jane and sees an opportunity to plan the white wedding that she herself never had. The bride's gay Uncle Winston, initially hurt and furious at having been left off the original guest list, becomes a support for Aggie. Jane is initially beguiled by the attention, and happily picks out a wedding dress ("One White Dress"). But soon relationships are strained to the breaking point under the pressure of costly bridesmaids' dresses, cake layers, and each detail. Aggie confesses to Jane that she and Tom were married because she was pregnant ("Vision"), and because her father bought Tom his share in the taxi. Finally Jane and Ralph decide to call off the elaborate wedding and party and marry quietly as they had planned. The quiet and unemotional Tom finally expresses his love and caring for Aggie ("I Stayed"), and Tom and Aggie come closer together. As they get ready for the small wedding ceremony, Aggie secretly makes arrangements for Tom to buy his share of the taxi, which arrives in time for him to drive her to their daughter's wedding. Uncle Winston has the last word ("Coney Island"): > "You paid your money, took the ride, but missed the view." ==Song list== *Partners — Tom Hurley, Sam, Ralph Halloran and Jane Hurley *Ralph and Me — Jane Hurley *Married — Aggie *Women Chatter — Myra, Pasha and Dolores *No Fuss — Aggie *Your Children's Happiness — Mr. Halloran and Mrs. Halloran *Immediate Family — Uncle Winston *Our Only Daughter — Aggie *Women Chatter 2 — Dolores, Pasha and Uncle Winston *One White Dress — Jane Hurley and Aggie *Vision — Aggie *Don't Ever Stop Saying "I Love You" — Jane Hurley and Ralph Halloran *I Stayed — Tom Hurley *Married (Reprise) — Aggie *Coney Island — Uncle Winston *Don't Ever Stop Saying "I Love You" (Reprise) — Ralph Halloran, Jane Hurley and Tom Hurley *Coney Island (Reprise) — Uncle Winston and Company ==Roles and original cast== *Uncle Winston - Harvey Fierstein *Aggie Hurley - Faith Prince *Jane Hurley - Leslie Kritzer *Tom Hurley - Tom Wopat *Ralph Halloran - Matt Cavenaugh *Mr. Halloran/Sam - Philip Hoffman *Alice/Army Sergeant - Katie Klaus *Delores/Caterer - Heather MacRae *Mrs. Halloran/Pasha - Lori Wilner *Myra/Dress Saleswoman - Kristine Zbornik ==Recording== The Original Cast recording was recorded by PS Classics and was released on May 27, 2008.playbill article, April 7, 2008 Catered Affair Cast Preserves Bucchino Score April 7 ==Critical response== A Catered Affair received mixed reviews.Gold Derby column, Los Angeles Times, O'Neil, Tom, April 22, 2008 Retrieved May 4, 2008 Ben Brantley for The New York Times, wrote: "From Mr. Bucchino’s trickling, self-effacing score to the tight-lipped stoicism of its leading performances, from David Gallo’s tidy tenement-scape set to Zachary Borovay’s tentative photographic projections, this show is all pale, tasteful understatement that seems to be apologizing for asking for your attention... Ms. Prince, best known for her madcap musical turns in revivals of Guys and Dolls and Bells Are Ringing, scrubs down to raw-skinned plainness here.

3300485	A Catholic Education	A Catholic Education is the debut album by Scottish alternative rock band Teenage Fanclub, released in 1990. The album received positive reviews from UK music journalists and critics. The album's dark, heavy sound has been described as differing in tone and style from the band's later power pop work. "Everything Flows" was later included in the compilation albums Deep Fried Fanclub and Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds – A Short Cut to Teenage Fanclub. Those were released in 1995 and 2003, respectively. == Background == Teenage Fanclub had been formed in 1989 as a continuation of what guitarists Norman Blake and Raymond McGinley and drummer Francis Macdonald had been doing in their previous band The Boy Hairdressers. Blake: "We’d been around a lot of people trying to get record deals, and we thought, "That’s too much like hard work, let’s just make a record." They managed to raise enough money to buy studio time at Pet Sounds Studios in Glasgow. Blake later said, "Raymond sold a fridge and a washing machine his neighbour had left him, and we made ‘A Catholic Education’ from that." Bassist Gerard Love: "I met Norman at a gig in May 1989, and then later on they asked if I’d be interested in joining them to record the album. By mid-July we were in the studio." After finishing his drum parts for the album, Macdonald left the band to be replaced by Brendan O'Hare. Macdonald: "I’d always said, "I’m happy to be on the record, but I’ll probably go back to university and finish my studies afterwards." Even though the band now had an album’s worth of material, they weren’t completely happy with it, so they decided to re-record four songs at Suite 16 in Rochdale with O'Hare on drums. The band originally intended to release the album themselves, but a tape of the recordings found its way to the two newly established independent record labels Paperhouse and Matador. Both labels ended up releasing the album, Paperhouse in the UK on 11 June 1990, and Matador in the US on 2 August 1990.Teenage Fanclub Discography == Album title == Norman Blake said of the album title in 2016: "A Catholic Education was an irreverent thing, we thought it would get a reaction living in the west of Scotland and we knew people would say ‘what do they mean, what’s that all about,’ kind of thing. I wasn’t Catholic but I think we wanted to provoke a response. ... Certainly no one was angry with us for calling it that. We also meant it in the other meaning of Catholic being eclectic and bringing a lot of influences to the band. We just thought it sounded good as well." == Reception == At the time of release, A Catholic Education received mainly positive reviews from music critics. In a retrospective review, Jason Ankeny of AllMusic noted that A Catholic Education's "gloriously sloppy and sludgy sound" was far removed from the "sparkling power pop" of their later albums. Instead, the album "prefigures the emergence of grunge, its viscous melodies and squalling guitars owing far more to Neil Young than Big Star." Ankeny concluded that despite the album's differences in attitude and approach, "there's no mistaking the effortless melodicism that remains the hallmark of all Teenage Fanclub records." Trouser Press wrote that the band's "straightforward guitar pop" was presented in a "flattering light", but that the album suffered from uneven songwriting. They felt that after "Everything Flows," "Critical Mass," "Eternal Light" and "Everybody's Fool", "slim pickings keep A Catholic Education from being a full course." In another retrospective review, the music review web site Record Rewind Play wrote: "A Catholic Education is a better album than many people give it credit for - often dismissed as a feeling-their-way album chiefly of interest for one towering song" ["Everything Flows"]. They, however, felt that the album lacked "production sheen", writing: "There’s a roughness to this album that veers from charming to frustrating." == Track listing == == Personnel == ;Teenage Fanclub * Norman Blake – vocals, guitar * Gerard Love – bass * Raymond McGinley – guitar * Brendan O'Hare – drums * Francis Macdonald – drums ;Technical * Ted Blakeway – engineering (Pet Sounds) * Rex Sargeant – engineering (Suite 16) == References == Category:Teenage Fanclub albums Category:1990 debut albums Category:Fire Records (UK) albums Category:Matador Records albums
32697986	A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion	frame|The advertisement, with a list of signatories at the bottom. "A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion", alternatively referred to by its pull quote "A Diversity of Opinions Regarding Abortion Exists Among Committed Catholics" or simply "The New York Times ad", was a full-page advertisement placed on October 7, 1984, in The New York Times by Catholics for a Free Choice (CFFC). Its publication brought to a head the conflict between the Vatican and those American Catholics who were pro-choice. The publicity and controversy which followed its publication helped to make the CFFC an important element of the pro-choice movement.Djupe, Paul A. and Laura R. Olson, Encyclopedia of American religion and politics, p. 84, Infobase Publishing 2003 Before mid-1984, a Catholic position paper was signed by about 80 reform-minded theologians and members of religious institutes who were sympathetic to choice in abortion. This position paper was used by CFFC as the basis for The New York Times ad. CFFC's statement said that the Catholic Church's doctrine condemning abortion as "morally wrong in all instances" was "not the only legitimate Catholic position." It said that "a large number" of Catholic theologians considered abortion to be a moral choice in some cases and cited a recent survey which found that only 11% of Catholics believed that abortion was wrong under all circumstances. It called for value pluralism and discussion within the Church on the subject. More signatures were added, bringing the total to 97 prominent Catholics including theologians, nuns, priests and lay persons. The advertisement was intended to help 1984 vice- presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro, a pro-choice Catholic, to resist the sharp criticism directed at her by Archbishop of New York John Joseph O'Connor during the 1984 U.S. presidential election. Following the ad's publication, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops denounced it and called it contrary to "the clear and consistent teaching of the church that deliberately chosen abortion is objectively immoral." Subsequently, the Vatican pursued recantings by or reprimands of the signers who were directly subject to Church authority, including 24 nuns who became known as the "Vatican 24". Some signers recanted their affiliation with CFFC; most were said by their superiors to be in line with Catholic teaching. Two nuns resisted, publicly embraced a pro-choice position and eventually left their order. ==Background== In 1982, CFFC invited members of Congress to a briefing titled "The Abortion Issue in the Political Process" describing the problems facing Catholic politicians and to show that there was a range of personal and political responses to the issue of abortion. Geraldine Ferraro, then a member of the United States House of Representatives, wrote the introduction to the briefing. She wrote, "As Catholics we deal each day, both personally and politically, with the wrenching abortion issue ...the Catholic position on abortion is not monolithic and there can be a range of personal and political responses to the issue." Other endorsers of the briefing included fellow Democratic politicians Leon Panetta and Tom Daschle. Catholic ethicist Daniel C. Maguire co-authored a position paper on abortion and religious pluralism with feminist Frances Kissling, the president of CFFC, and Maguire's wife Marjorie Reily Maguire, a theologian and CFFC activist. The position paper, titled "A Catholic Statement on Abortion", was circulated among several groups of theologians including the College Theology Society, of which Marjorie Maguire was a member, and the Catholic Theological Society of America. Those who were sympathetic to moral pluralism and the possibility of nuanced abortion positions in the Catholic Church signed the statement and formed the Catholic Committee on Pluralism and Abortion. When Ferraro was named Walter Mondale's running mate for the Democratic Party in the 1984 election, Archbishop O'Connor and Archbishop of Boston Bernard Francis Law issued statements denouncing her position on abortion. It is likely that O'Connor targeted Ferraro because of her association with CFFC. O'Connor said that Catholic voters should not vote for pro-choice politicians. O'Connor said Ferraro "has given the world to understand that Catholic teaching is divided on the subject of abortion", which he said was wrong. Ferraro said that her personal pro-choice views were not something she would force on the nation; she said she would follow the law of the land as interpreted by the Supreme Court. After receiving more criticism from O'Connor, Ferraro acknowledged that the Church's position on abortion was indeed "monolithic", but said many Catholics "do not share the view of the Catholic Church." ==Publication== CFFC wanted to make clear the church's hierarchy did not speak for them. The CFFC turned the Maguire/Maguire/Kissling position paper holding about 80 signatures from leading Catholic reformers into a statement suitable for the public, and in August–September 1984 they sought further signatures from such groups as the Women Church Convergence, a group working to increase women's roles in the Church. A total of 97 signatures was gathered, including 26 nuns, two priests, and two lay brothers. The CFFC paid $30,000 for an advertisement in The New York Times, to run on a day that was the annual "Respect Life Sunday" celebrated by American bishops. The timing was intended to help Ferraro retain support in her campaign. On October 7, 1984, one full page of The New York Times carried the combined statement of the CFFC and the other signers. At the top of the page were the bold-type words: "A Diversity of Opinions Regarding Abortion Exists Among Committed Catholics". Underneath that was the title "A Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion". Following this was a citation to a poll showing only 11% of American Catholics surveyed opposed abortion in all circumstance, and an endorsement of "candid and respectful discussion" within the Church of a "diversity of opinion" held by Catholics on the issue. The bottom of the page included 97 names divided into two groups: 15 members of the Catholic Committee on Pluralism and Abortion, and 82 others in a group marked "Other Signers". The advertisement concluded by saying the list of signers was only partial—that 75 priests, members of religious institutes, and theologians had written in support "but cannot sign because they fear losing their jobs." The second paragraph read as follows: ==Reaction== On November 14, 1984, following the election (which Mondale and Ferraro lost), the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops issued a statement saying the text of the advertisement could only represent the personal opinions of the signers because they were in contradiction to "the clear and consistent teaching of the church that deliberately chosen abortion is objectively immoral." Cardinal Jean Jerome Hamer, author of the 1974 reaffirmation against procured abortion and the prefect of the Congregation for Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, requested on November 30, 1984, that the signers who were subject to Church authority be required to publicly retract their position or be dismissed. This elicited a good deal of international press coverage. Of the 26 nuns, two were taken off the Vatican's list, one for unknown reasons and the other because her missionary order was not under Hamer's supervision. The remaining 24 nuns were labeled the "Vatican 24" by the press. Some 35 of the signers met at the St. Charles Hotel in Washington, D.C. on December 19, 1984, to determine a course of action. The meeting included 18 nuns of the Vatican 24. They said the Vatican, in its stern reaction, "seeks to stifle freedom of speech and public discussion in the Roman Catholic Church and create the appearance of a consensus where none exists." The group issued a statement describing the current Church stance as not in the spirit of the Vatican II which said, "Let there be unity in what is necessary, freedom in what is unsettled and charity in any case." Sister Donna Quinn, a past president of the National Coalition of American Nuns, said, "We believe we have a right to speak out when we have a differing opinion, and this is something European men do not understand." The four male members of institutes who signed—two priests and two lay brothers—recanted in published statements, the last on January 17, 1985. The Vatican announced that many of the nuns had also recanted. In seeking to discipline the nuns, the Vatican did not contact any one of them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that they accepted Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had sent a letter to the Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues. Two Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur, Patricia Hussey and Barbara Ferraro (no relation to Geraldine Ferraro), did not recant from their pro-choice positions. Hussey and Ferraro, directors of the Covenant House in Charleston, West Virginia—a shelter for homeless and abused women and children—were supported by CFFC in their dispute with the Church. By March 1986, Hussey and Ferraro were no longer calling for "dialogue" but were publicly demanding recognition of "a woman's right to choose." In July 1986 when the two nuns were pressured more strongly with expulsion, 11 of the other nuns who signed came forward with a statement in solidarity with them, denying a recent Vatican announcement that all nuns but Hussey and Ferraro were now aligned with the Church's position on abortion. The eleven complained of the Church's divisive tactics, which they said were intended to isolate Hussey and Ferraro. Signer Maureen Fiedler said, "I have never retracted or recanted one syllable of the Catholic Statement on Abortion and Pluralism. I continue to stand behind every word of it without the slightest reservation." After nearly four years of dispute, Hussey and Ferraro were informed by their order's leadership in June 1988 that they would not be dismissed from the order. However, the leadership of the School Sisters of Notre Dame distanced the order from Hussey and Ferraro, calling them "intransigent" and stating that they "have in practice placed themselves outside the life and mission of the congregation."A. Goldman, "'Pro-Choice Nuns'; Another Challenge to Rome by Liberal Catholics in U.S.", New York Times, June 12, 1988 The two nuns subsequently held a press conference and announced that a woman "can be publicly pro-choice and still be a nun." In July 1988, the two resigned from the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. Signer Judith Vaughan, a resident of Los Angeles and a nun with the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, said, "We didn't commit a crime. All we did was say, 'Hey, there's a diversity of opinion among people [of our faith] and we need to talk about freedom of conscience.' I don't see myself as defiant." In January 1985, Monsignor John P. Languille sent a memo to all Los Angeles social service directors, ordering them to cease referring homeless women to the shelter Vaughan supervised "because of [her] pro-abortion position". Vaughan was reportedly expelled in February 1985 but in April 1986 she spoke to the Los Angeles Times to say that the Church had closed the case without requiring her to retract her statement. With the help of her superior, Sister Miriam Therese Larkin of St. Louis, Missouri, she retained her position in the order, and Languille's memo was overturned. Yale Divinity School ethics professor Sister Margaret Farley said that her signing of the 1984 advertisement came up in early 1986 when she was to be honored with an award given by John Carroll University, a Catholic institution in Cleveland, Ohio. The Cleveland archdiocese wrote to the Vatican to determine Farley's status, and the Vatican responded that Farley "has retracted her signature from the 'Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion.'" Sister Helen Amos, the president of Farley's order, the Sisters of Mercy, was quoted by the Vatican: "Sister Margaret's position is in accord with the teaching of the Church." This statement had been accepted as a recantation by Cardinal Hamer in December 1985. After learning of the Vatican response, Farley said Hamer's assumption was in error, that she had never recanted or asked that her signature be removed. She said, "What I did...was to clarify my position. And that was accepted as sufficient." ==Later events== Several nuns were given a platform to air their views including activist nuns such as Marjorie Tuite, Margaret Traxler, and six nuns of the order Sisters of Loretto, an order known for its work on pacifism and social justice. In some cases, signers of the statement grew more radical in their beliefs after being reprimanded by church authority. In the publicity surrounding the dispute with the nuns and the theologians, the statistics showing that most American Catholics disagreed with church teachings about abortion were repeated many times. Traxler appeared in a television spot with a tube of toothpaste, saying that you cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube. The various responses to the 1984 advertisement and its aftermath remained in the news through 1986. On March 2, 1986, a follow-up advertisement was placed by the Committee of Concerned Catholics, signed by more than 1,000 Catholics supportive of the right to speak dissenting views on abortion and other controversial subjects. This advertisement was intended to show solidarity for the 97 signers of the 1984 advertisement who were threatened by the Church. It began, "We affirm our solidarity with all Catholics whose right to free speech is under attack." Committee member Kissling said that, though seven nuns had "clarified" their positions, "There have been no retractions; there have been no withdrawals." She said the Church's assertion that many nuns had disavowed their 1984 signing was "a lot of wishful thinking". Nine conservative Catholic lay group leaders responded with a letter to Hamer asking for quick disciplinary action against dissenting nuns. They warned that "the revolt is spreading" against the church's position on abortion, and chided the Vatican for failing to react decisively against signers of the first ad. Some Catholic theologians who signed the statement reported being threatened with stagnation in their careers, and found that speaking engagements were canceled because of the controversy. Theologians Daniel Maguire, Rosemary Radford Ruether, Giles Milhaven, Elizabeth Jane Via, Mary I. Buckley, Kathleen M. O'Connor and Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza all saw their careers limited after October 1984. As hosted by Religion Online. Sister Anne Carr felt pressured to quit the women's advisory committee assigned to assist U.S. bishops write a pastoral on women. In August 1992, filmmakers Sylvia Morales and Jean Victor presented their PBS POV documentary about three nuns, including one of the Vatican 24. Titled "Faith Even to the Fire", the program followed statement signer Sister Judith Vaughan, who faced difficulty in Los Angeles then moved to Chicago to lead the National Assembly of Religious Women. Also featured were Sisters Marie de Pores Taylor of Oakland, California, and Rosa Marta Zarate of San Bernardino, California. ==Signers== Signers of the statement whose names appeared in the advertisement include: ===Catholic Committee on Pluralism and Abortion=== *Anthony Battaglia, Ph.D., Associate Professor, Religious Studies, California State University, Long Beach *Roddy O'Neil Cleary, D.Min., University of Vermont *Joseph Fahey, Ph.D., Professor, Manhattan College *Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza, Ph.D., Professor, University of Notre Dame *Mary Gordon, M.A., author of Final Payments and Company of Women *Patricia Hennessy, J.D., New York City *Mary E.

33456414	A Causal Theory of Knowing	"A Causal Theory of Knowing" is a philosophical essay written by Alvin Goldman in 1967, published in The Journal of Philosophy. It is based on existing theories of knowledge in the realm of epistemology, the study of philosophy through the scope of knowledge. The essay attempts to define knowledge by connecting facts, beliefs and knowledge through underlying and connective series called causal chains. It provides a causal theory of knowledge. A causal chain is repeatedly described as a sequence of events for which one event in a chain causes the next. According to Goldman, these chains can only exist with the presence of an accepted fact, a belief in the fact, and a cause for the subject to believe the fact. The essay also explores the ideas of perception and memory through the use of the causal chains and the concept of knowledge. ==Background== The essay is regarded as an improvement and rebuttal of Edmund Gettier's "Is Justified True Belief Knowledge?", which is one of many attempts to explain the necessary conditions for knowledge to develop. Goldman implements the causal connection to reiterate his own theory of knowledge. Knowledge exists, says Goldman, if and only if the belief is justified by a reaction to the accepted fact. Goldman's theory later counters that of Michael Clark, stating that his own theory including figures and diagrams is more appropriate than Clark's. "A Causal Theory of Knowing" uses figures which make explicit references to causal beliefs. Clark's model does not utilize these arrows, and Goldman states that the lack of these arrows deems Clark's model deficient. ==Author== Alvin Goldman, currently a professor of philosophy at Rutgers University, wrote "A Causal Theory of Knowing" when he was in his late twenties. Goldman received his Ph.D. from Princeton University, and has taught at numerous universities. Goldman's research deals mainly with epistemology and other cognitive sciences. "A Causal Theory of Knowing" was Goldman's first published paper explaining his own views of epistemology. Currently, Goldman has written more than ten essays focusing on knowledge and cognitive science. ==Contents== The essay starts with a definition of Gettier's theory, followed by multiple reiterations of the idea of causal connections, figures to explain knowledge through a visual perspective, and references to perception and memory through causal chains. The essay tends to focus on examples in which knowledge or other sensations do not exist, rather than proving a certain fact to be known. Goldman also states on multiple occasions that he does not wish to explain the causal process in detail, instead pointing out counterexamples. At numerous times in the essay, he also points out that he does not intend to give definitive answers to each of the propositions mentioned. Goldman also refocuses the idea of perception, or knowledge through sensation (specifically sight) using his own theory of knowing. The concept of causal perception indicates that one observes something only if the object itself causes the sensation of sight to be accepted as known. Thus, the object's existence must be factual and one must believe its existence. While all knowledge comes from facts, inferred knowledge emerges when physical object facts cause sense data which can be perceived as senses. The sense data can also be used to make conclusions, known as inferred knowledge, about certain physical object facts. From "A Causal Theory of Knowing", Goldman constructs the idea that memory is also a causal process. Memory is explained as being an extension of knowledge into the future, and remembering is the act of recalling a fact that has already been known. Further, the theory states that if knowledge is forgotten at one time, it cannot be considered a memory in the future. According to Goldman, if a fact is known at Time 1 but forgotten at Time 2, and then at Time 3 that the fact is perceived again but not known, at Time 3 the original fact is not a memory because there is no causal connection between the fact and the memory. ==Footnotes== == References == * * * * == External links == * Category:Philosophy essays Category:Epistemological theories Category:Epistemology literature Category:Causality Category:Contemporary philosophical literature Category:1967 essays

58752151	A Cavalryman	A Cavalryman is an oil on canvas painting by French artist Alphonse-Marie- Adolphe de Neuville, from 1884. It depicts a French cavalryman on a yellow field. The work is in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in New York. ==Description== A Cavalryman depicts a French dragoon of either the First or Second French Empires. Dragoons were mounted infantry capable of riding into on an engagement on horses before dismounting to engage enemy forces on foot; this important role, coupled with the cost of horses, resulted in dragoons being known as elite-but-expensive troops. Some sources identify the painting subject as a trumpeter. Dragoons became a subject of various works of military art, including the works of the painter Ernest Meissonier, whose style De Neuville directly emulated in the current painting. The canvas itself was produced after the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War resulted in an upsurge of interest in the military in the French Third Republic. As noted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, De Neuville "capitalized on the intense patriotism and dreams of military glory that the French defeat aroused" with his work. ==References== Category:Paintings by Alphonse de Neuville Category:Paintings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:1884 paintings Category:Military art Category:Horses in art

3764406	A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors	A Caveat or Warning for Common Cursitors, vulgarly called vagabonds (shortened as Caveat) was first published in 1566 by Thomas Harman, and although no copies of that edition survive, it must have been popular, because two printers were punished by the Stationers' Company in 1567 for pirated editions. Two editions were published in 1568, and a revised edition in 1573. It is one of the fundamental texts for rogue literature. Harman is one of the first writers to use the word rogue, which was adopted in the Poor Law legislation of 1572. Harman claimed to have collected his material directly from interviews with vagabonds themselves. The Caveat contained stories of vagabond life, a description of their society and techniques, a taxonomy of rogues, and a canting dictionary, which were reproduced in later works. Harman's reputation has changed since his work was first republished in the early twentieth century; A. V. Judges described him then as having "all the deftness of the trained sociologist", and the Caveat has been used as a primary source. However, historians have long doubted the reliability of his accounts of vagabond society and the use of cant. Harman has been subject to literary analysis informed by Marx, Freud and Foucault, although historian A.L. Beier suggested these "appear to be fruitful sources of fertile error". Harman was certainly not a neutral observer; he frequently makes an explicit moral and social judgement about his subjects. These reflect a society in which sexual incontinence (that is, promiscuity) was subject to penalties in the local manor courts, the church courts and by justices of the peace in quarter sessions. It was also a society in ferment over the appropriate response to the increasing number of "masterless men". A large part of the Caveat was included in William Harrison's 16th-century work, Description of England as part of Holinshed's Chronicle. Harman influenced and justified the legal punishment of vagrants, particularly the 1572 Vagabond Act. It was Harman's characterization of vagrants that influenced Elizabethan perspectives on them. ==Thomas Harman== Little is known about Thomas Harman's life. He was from the gentry, described as an esquire in 1557, and with a coat of arms, with which he marked his plate. He inherited land in several parishes in Kent, and resided on an estate near Dartford from 1547. His wife Anne was the daughter of Sir Edward Rogers, who was Comptroller to Queen Elizabeth I. In the Caveat he implies that he was a justice of the peace, but there is no evidence for this. However, in 1550 he was appointed to collect tax in Kent, and in 1554 and 1555 he was a member of the important commission responsible for the Thames and its tributaries from near Southwark to Gravesend. A fellow member of the commission was responsible for the creation of the Bridewell Palace in London, and Harman was clearly acquainted with developments in law enforcement there. The Caveat is dedicated to Bess of Hardwick, although that does not mean that she was known personally to Harman. There are literary precursors to the Caveat, including John Awdeley's The Fraternity of Vagabonds (1561), of which Harman was aware. It was written in a period when the government in England was increasingly concerned with the perceived problem of "masterless men". Solutions were being sought to the issue of the able-bodied poor. In 1563, the Statute of Artificers was passed "to banish idleness". Poor Laws were under review, and a plethora of laws passed against vagrancy, in which the punishments ranged from whipping to branding. In 1559, there was a proposal from a committee (the Privy Council) to restore an act of 1547 that provided for slavery as a punishment. ==Vagabond society== Harman set out a taxonomy of rogues, which expanded one sketched out by Awdeley. The structure and processes of this mirrored those of Tudor society, with its hierarchy and sumptuary laws, and the trade guilds, with their apprenticeships and initiations ceremonies. An example is the ceremony of "stalling a rogue" which Harman describes. In this an Upright Man pours beer over the head of the initiate, with the words, "I, G.P., do stall thee, W.T., to the rogue, and that henceforth it shall be lawful for you to cant . . . for thy living in all places". Such a ceremony is reproduced in later rogue literature, and in the play The Beggars Bush by Beaumont, Fletcher and Massinger, from which it was extracted by Francis Kirkman in The Wits. Bampfylde Moore Carew includes a similar account of his own inauguration as King of the Beggars, and there was a tradition that the graves of members of the Boswell gypsy family were visited annually and beer poured onto them during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Although his taxonomy has been read as if these roles were fixed, Harman's examples made it clear that many of these roles were modes of begging or crime adopted by the same vagabond from time to time. They also make it clear that many of these villains also had legitimate trades, which they exercised from time to time. This is confirmed by the historical record, which shows that many of those arrested as vagrants were unemployed through no fault of their own. They included domestic servants who had been dismissed, labourers seeking work, or those whose trade required travel, such as pedlars and chapmen (peddler). Harman does seem to have had direct contact with vagabonds, while most of those who wrote later rogue literature were London based writers living in literary circles. Another area in which Harman has been misunderstood is the place of Egyptians in this vagabond culture. They have no specific place in it, and although he identifies a few individuals as being Egyptians, he describes them generally as having a distinct culture and lifestyle. This is consistent with the attitude to them generally, that they were strange, foreign, little understood and, therefore criminal or at least a danger to the social order. The attitude to the Irish seems to have been similar, though less extreme. ===Categories of rogue=== The following is summarised from Harman, with comments in brackets: ; Abram Men : or Abraham-men. Feign madness and claim to have been inmates at Bedlam, (where there was an Abraham Ward). If they are not given alms through pity they resort to becoming threatening, and playing on the fear that the mentally ill are dangerous. (They were also known as Bethlem Men, and later Poor Toms. It was believed that the Governors of Bedlam authorized some discharged patients to beg and gave them tin badges, although in 1675 the Governors denied this.) ; Autem Morts : Female rogues actually married in church, though not faithful to their husbands. Harman says they go about with children who they send to steal from houses. ; Bawdy Baskets : Female pedlars, who travel from house to house. Harman says that only one, who he names, is honest. The rest steal and buy from servants at under value, living with Upright Men, who provide them with protection. ; Counterfeit Cranks : Pretend to suffer from the "falling sickness" (epilepsy). They wear dirty clothes, and carry soap so they can use it to foam at the mouth. Some carry false testimonials from ministers in Shropshire. This is one of the modes adopted by Nicholas Blunt. ; Demanders for Glimmer : Beggars pretending to have suffered loss by fire, carrying counterfeit licenses. Harman says most of these are women, who collect money, and food, which they sell, and able to earn 6 or 7 s. a week. They worked with Upright Men, but were careful not to be seen with them. ; Dells : Female rogues who are still virgins. Harman says they are either "Wild Dells", born to doxies, or have lost their parents or been run away from service with some "sharp mistress". ; A Doxy : A female rogue whose virginity has been taken by an Upright Man. They are dependent on Upright Men and other rogues. Harman's objection is to their promiscuous lifestyle. He remarks that their breeches serve a dual purpose, as they are also used to carry food they are given. ; Dummerers : Beggars pretending dumbness, most of whom Harman says came from Wales. He recounts how, having satisfied himself that a license produced by one of these was false, he and a surgeon hung him by his wrists from a beam until he spoke. Harman took his money and distributed it to the poor, and the dummerer and his palliard were taken before a Justice, pilloried and whipped. ; Fraters : Pretending to be factors or proctors with false licenses to collect alms for hospitals. ; Hooker or Angler : They carry a long staff and go to houses seeking charity during the day to see what may be stolen. After dark they return and use an iron stick with a hook at the end to reach in through windows to steal clothes and linen, which they hide nearby before taking it to sell. ; Jarkmen or Patricos : Harman says that although Awdeley refers these to, neither exists. A Jarkman is supposed to be a forger of licenses, but Harman says that these are not made by vagabonds, as he has never come across one capable of writing well enough, but bought by them in towns, "as what can not be had for money?" (Harman is probably right. Several false licenses survive, and the historical evidence is that they were mostly produced by provincial schoolmasters, who were notoriously poorly paid. There does seem to have been a real market for these, with the price determined by the content and quality of the license and the current ferocity of law enforcement). Harman accepts that "Patricos" was the cant word for priest, but says they did not have priests or any ceremony of marriage, as few were married, preferring "natural fellowship and good liking". ; Kinchin Coves : Young male rogues. Harman allows them no prospect of reform, saying, "when he groweth unto years, he is better to hang than draw forth". ; Kinchin Morts : Young female rogues carried on their mother's back in sheets. ; Palliards : Also known as clapperdudgeons. They travel in patched cloaks, with their "wives", seeking alms, but selling what they are given. They work alone but meet in groups at night. Many are Irish and travel with false passports. The Welsh also use herbs to raise wounds on their legs. (Several recipes for this survive. Harman does not explain explicitly the underlying evil of this trick; that it transforms them from sturdy beggars to deserving beggars who cannot work.) ; Priggers of Prancers : Horse thieves, using various methods. Harman says they will take the horses at least three score miles off to sell. (The problem of horse theft was significant and laws were passed to require records of all horses sold at markets and fairs, and that two people vouch for the seller.) ; Rogues : These are "neither as stout or hardy as the upright man", but live much the same way, begging, stealing and traveling with false passports. ; Ruffler : A former soldier or serving man who has chosen a vagabond life, who rob, demand or beg as the opportunity arises. Harman says that after a year or two they become Upright Men, "unless they prevented by twisted hemp" (hanging). The word was used in a 1535 Tudor Act against vagrants. ; Swadders or Pedlars : Harman concedes, "not all be evil, but of an indifferent behaviour". His objection is that some bribe and steal, and provide outlets for stolen goods which they are given by Upright Men. ; Tinkers or Priggs : Harman does not condemn all tinkers, only those who cheat, steal and spend their money on drink. He says they travel with their "doxies", whom they change frequently. ; Upright Man : "some be serving men, artificers, and labouring men traded up in husbandry [who]. . . not minding to live by the sweat of their face," wander through the counties offering the best poor relief. They are skilled professional thieves. Upright Men had authority over other beggars, from whom they could demand money, or other favours. They carried a staff, called a filchman, as a sign of their position. (Harman's phraseology follows a tradition which goes back to, at least, the introduction to and justification for the Statute of Labourers in 1381.) ; Walking Morts : Unmarried female rogues, who live by peddling, or begging, but their goods are taken by Upright Men. Harman recounts a conversation with one in which he rebuked her "for her lewd life and beastly behaviour, declaring to her what punishment was prepared and heaped up for in the world to come." Her response was, "…how should I live? None will take me into service. But I labour in harvest-time honestly." ; Whipjacks or Freshwater Mariners : These pretend to be shipwrecked sailors, who were likely to be tolerated, and allowed to travel to their supposed homes, or given support. Harman says that most came from Ireland and the west of England, and operated in the counties east of Wiltshire. Some carried counterfeit licences from the Admiralty, which Harman says they bought in Portsmouth for 2s. (Distressed mariners were sometimes licensed to seek alms, as were the relatives of those whose relatives were kidnapped by corsairs. False licences, or, in cant,"jarks" were popular, as they were difficult to check.) ; Wild Rogues : Rogues born to rogues, ("beastly begotten in barn or bushes"), and by nature more given to "knavery". Harman says that questioning one he replied that his father and grandfather had been beggars, "and he must needs be one by good reason." ===Canting Dictionary=== Harman includes a short dictionary of cant words. His introduction to that is characteristic of his literary style and social attitude:- "Here I set before the good reader the lewd, lousy language of these loitering lusks and lazy lorels, wherewith they buy and sell the common people as they pass through the country." The value of the dictionary to the "good reader" was probably minimal. Cant has only been found in court records six times, all after Harman and Awdeley, and the extent to which it was actually used is unclear. However, it was a goldmine for later writers, who various copied it, expanded on it, or used it to add colour to pamphlets and plays. Harman's taxonomy is reproduced in William Harrison's Description of England, contained in Holinshed's Chronicles (1577, 1587), as history, and extensively copied by in rogue literature, including Thomas Dekker, in Lantern and Candlelight (1608), Richard Head The English Rogue (1665), and The Life and Adventures of Bampfylde Moore Carew' (1745). ===Rogue Tales=== Harman claimed that having for twenty years kept a house on the main road to London, and having through sickness been at his home much, he had learned how to extract information from those vagabonds who called seeking alms. His accounts show similarities to the depositions taken by Justices of the Peace examining cases, and have been assumed to have been the same kind of first hand account collected by researchers such as Henry Mayhew. However, Harman is not a disinterested observer or reporter. He regards himself as a skilled interrogator, and the information to have been extracted against the will of those providing it. Although there is no suggestion he did so frequently, he approvingly reports his own use of violence to extract a confession in one case. He justifies his expansion of Awdeley's work by saying it was insufficient to protect people. His work is aimed at assisting law enforcement, and ridding the country of rogues, so that parishes can concentrate their spending on the relief of the deserving poor. Also, although he denies it, he writes with style, being fond of alliteration, and within a tradition of vulgar writing in chapbooks and jest books, which included crude and sexual references. Such writing was at the time widely acceptable; Sir Thomas More, and Erasmus wrote jests, the latter including a fart joke, and on her deathbed in 1603 courtiers read to Queen Elizabeth from the jest book A Hundred Merry Tales, (1526). Two-thirds of the Caveat is taken up with stories, and in the second edition he says he has added more. The stories are often comic, involving tricks, and have some moral element. A prime example is the man who rescues a "mort", having extracted a promise of sexual favours for doing so. She defers the reward, in the meantime informs local "gossips", and the lecher is caught by his wife and her friends with his pants literally down and soundly beaten by them. ===Nicholas Jennings=== Harman lists by name 215 Upright Men, Rogues and Palliards in separate lists. Of these 18 have been identified with named individuals punished as vagabonds in contemporary court records by Aydelotte. He also found about a dozen more punished for other offences. Taking into account the possibility of coincidences, the likelihood or apprehension, and the use of false names, this does suggest that some of Harman's information was reliable. The most significant and detailed account given by Harman concerns a man named by him in his list of rogues as "Nicholas Blunt (alias Nicholas Jennings, a counterfeit crank) ". Harman recounts Blunt's appearance at his lodgings in Whitefriars on All Hallows Day 1566 seeking alms, naked from the waist upwards, in ragged dirty clothes, his face smeared with fresh blood feigning the "falling sickness" (probably palsy or epilepsy). Being suspicious Harman questioned him, and Blunt claimed to have been suffering from the falling sickness for eight years, and to have been discharged from Bedlam two weeks before, after being an inmate there two years. Harman checked with the keeper of the hospital who denied this, and then had Blunt followed by two boys from his printers, who saw him beg all day, renewing the blood from a bladder, and putting fresh mud on his clothes. They then followed him to Newington, south of the river, where the Constable apprehended him. On being searched he was found to have collected 13s. 3½d. (a labourer would have earned 6d. a day). He was also stripped and found to be fit and well, but escaped naked across the fields in the dark. Having then spent a period begging in the guise of a sailor whose ship and cargo had been lost at sea, and then as "Nicholas Jennings", a well-dressed hatter who had come to London for work, Blunt happened to accost Harman's printer on New Year's Day 1567. The printer recognised him and had him arrested. After denials and another escape attempt Blunt made a confession and was found to have "a pretty house" in Newington, "well furnished" and with a wife living there. Blunt's punishment combined the old penal techniques of physical punishment and public exposure, with the modern theory of rehabilitation through labour. For the latter he was imprisoned in the new Bridewell. For the former he was whipped at a cart's tail through the streets of London, and put in the pillory at Cheapside dressed in both his "ugly and handsome attire". His picture was exhibited there, and while he was whipped, and also outside his house, and kept at the Bridewell "for a monument". We know that at least the apprehension and whipping took place as there is a record of it in the Repertory of the Court of Aldermen for 13 January 1567. There are also records there of two others admitting similar crimes, in 1547 and 1517. Several illustrations of Blunt's tale appear in the Caveat. Both these and his story are repeated in later rogue literature. These illustrations and later texts often describe Blunt as an Upright Man, which Harman does not in his text. *'to filch', to beat, to strike, to rob. *'to maund', to ask or require. *'to cant', to speak. *'to prig', to ride. == See also == * Thieves' cant ==References== ==Sources== ===Biographical=== *Christopher Burlinson, 'Harman, Thomas (fl. 1547–1567)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Sept 2004; online edn, Oct 2006, accessed 4 Aug 2008 ===Text=== The Caveat is available online to subscribers to EEBO, and at Google Book Search.

5094210	A Cavern of Black Ice	A Cavern of Black Ice is a fantasy novel by British writer J. V. Jones, the first book in the Sword of Shadows series. It is followed by A Fortress of Grey Ice, A Sword from Red Ice and Watcher of the Dead. ==Plot summary== The story begins with a woman named Tarissa giving birth to a girl outside the city Spire Vanis. The girl, Ash March (possibly the daughter of Jack, from the Book of Words, is taken in by Penthero Iss, Spire Vanis's Surlord (a supreme ruler). After discovering that she will soon be moved to more prison-like quarters by the supposedly benevolent Surlord, she escapes. The book also relates the tale of a young clansman of the Blackhail clan named Raif Sevrance. Raif and his brother, Drey, return from hunting one morning to discover their party has been slain. After dispensing final rites to their clansmen, the brothers return home to find the foster son of the chief, Mace Blackhail relating a different version of the tale implicating Clan Bludd in the death of their friends and family. Mace becomes chief of Clan Blackhail through various acts of treachery and declares war on Clan Bludd; Raif realises that Mace is lying, but no one else who speaks against Mace lives to tell the tale. Raif is forced by social pressure in a raid on what Mace says is a Clan Bludd battle party; it instead contains the (innocent) family of Vaylo, chief of Clan Bludd. Refusing Mace's orders to kill these innocents, Raif flees and is exiled from his clan for disobeying orders. His uncle, Angus Lok, takes him to Spire Vanis. There, Angus and Raif rescue Ash from the Surlord's soldiers and flee the city, deciding to travel to another city called Ille Glaive. Along the way, Marafice Eye "the Knife", Iss's leading general, pursues them with some soldiers and a sorcerer called Sarga Veys. Most of the soldiers are lost as they follow Ash onto the ice of a lake, and subsequently drown, though Veys uses magic to escape and the Knife also makes it out. Once in Ille Glaive, Angus, Ash and Raif meet with Heritas Cant, another sorcerer. Cant explains Ash's abilities to reach the Blind, resting place of all manner of dark creatures sealed away in ancient history. Angus, Ash, and Raif then proceed northward to the Cavern of Black Ice, where Ash can get rid of her abilities as a Reach. As the group heads north they become captured by Clan Bludd, who have recently taken over a place they stop in. Raif is beaten severely for days. Vaylo fears Ash because of her connection to Iss, and contacts the Surlord to return her (we do not discover what happens to Angus). Ash forces Vaylo to postpone the execution of Raif, which allows his escape during a raid by Clan Blackhail. Drey, present at the raid, allows Raif to escape. The Knife attempts to rape Ash. She awakes before this occurs and unleashes the dark power within her, killing all but Veys and the Knife once more. Ash again travels towards the Cavern of Black Ice and re-meets Raif. Eventually, after a cold and difficult journey with the help of two mysterious "Sull" (a more advanced culture described earlier in the book), they arrive at the Cavern of Black Ice where Ash finally discharges her powers. ==References== ==External links== *Page at Internet Speculative Fiction Database Category:1999 American novels Category:American fantasy novels
3537854	A Cañiza	A Cañiza is a municipality in Galicia, Spain in the province of Pontevedra with an area of 108.1 km² and a population approaching 5,200 inhabitants in 2018 distributed across 9 parishes. A Cañiza is part of the comarca of A Paradanta. This category of village municipality, known for its excellent tourism and the strong momentum that is experiencing the industrial and business sector. The exquisite and rich local cuisine, from meat products with ham as a champion and holding important events, such as the ancient pilgrimages A Franqueira, declared by the Autonomous Community of Galicia Tourist Interest Party, or the known Ham Fair, are some of the tourist attractions .

The tourist offer is complete with services designed to improve the quality of life of its inhabitants and, at the same time, to meet the needs and demands of travelers who daily visit to Cañiza . == History == Despite being the newest of the parishes which constitute the Municipal, if we consider its founding year, A Cañiza is today the most important of the nine that make up the town, to reside in it the capital of the municipality, to focus on the same most of the administrative services and for being home to the most population despite being the smallest in size . However, as already noted, the history of this place goes back nearly 200 years ago. The first inhabitants of this parish were from nearby, especially Valeixe . Began to populate the area, specifically the area known today as A Calzada, to serve better and more closely the cultivation of their lands . For the first inhabitants would follow others because were increasingly neighbors who wanted to stay close to their property and their fields and they began to build their own rooms, which followed best buildings. The name " Cañizas " that was given to the parish, which was faithfully explains their origin. The area began to fill with a few booths or huts made of woven tree branches and covered with straw to which the people of the country were called Cañizas and hurdles, so that the farmers could shelter from the rain . They were also known then the hurdles with the name of granaries . Later also would begin construction of the so-called Royal Road of the cities of Tuy and Vigo for Castile, a work that would give the final impetus to this parish . The choice of route for these lands had much to do with good soil conditions. In this case Valeixe was relegated for having a more complicated orographic structure design of the roadway. For this voyage were raising numerous buildings . It was known as Main Street and also had a Coaching Inn for horse trough in the place we now know as Source of the Two Pipes. At first, the place of A Cañiza belonged to the parish of St ª. Valeixe Cristina, who Valeixe City Council, as tends to be confused even today . But on 9 July 1790, the Bishop of Tuy, Fernández Angulo D.Domingo become the neighborhood " the Canizas " in Santa Cristina annexed so repeatedly request the locals of this neighborhood because, among other reasons, to the great distance that had to travel daily to the parish church . The church was located in Valeixe, or what is the same at 9 kilometers by a bad and " rocky " road. Shortly thereafter begin to build a chapel on the ground now occupied by the Plaza Mayor of the town, dedicated to the Holy Name of Jesus and St ª. Teresa . The July 28, 1790, would mark the first baptism and first marriage on September 5, also of the same year . But funerals are still held in Valeixe until full breakup occurred . The population of the town grew increasingly more and wishing their neighbors separated entirely from the matrix and ask autonomy before the ordinary ecclesiastical parish of Tuy, did so in a contested trial, winning in a close case. They got the judgment on 25 February 1815. Due to political changes so significant that the country was living, A Cañiza had several cures treasurers and would have to wait until April or May 1844 to have its first abbot pastor named Dan. Benito Maria Sarmiento . It will be in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries when A Cañiza reach its peak . At this time it will increase your neighborhood a disproportionate, moved there Achas Justice for his hearing and became head Jurisdiction and party capital, taking the name has since Villa. In 1815 the town was governed by a regular judge your audience . Until 1820 A Cañiza not constitute City Hall with Mayor corresponding therefore to date and was ruled by Judge. === Prehistory === One of the oldest remains of the town is the ' Citania ', located in Bouzas Chan . In this town built during the prehistoric period we see the remains of the ' Casarellas ' circular floor . In the same place we highlight a dolmen with a piece domed cover . Also in the same area we try to decipher the cave petroglyphs . === Antiquity === The earliest known writings which mentions this area date back to the year 138 .

Entertainment, who owns the franchise, and Scholastic, publishers of the book series in the United States. The inaugural event took place on the weekend of January 24–26, 2014, and the final event on the weekend of January 26–28, 2018. ==Event== The event featured film talent Q&A; sessions, discussion panels, special demonstrations, photo-ops, expos from Pottermore, the Wizarding World franchise, Scholastic, graphic designer company MinaLima, and film props and costumes brought in from Warner Bros. Studio Tour London – The Making of Harry Potter in Leavesden and Harry Potter: The Exhibition. Talent Q&A; sessions, discussion panels and special demonstrations were held between the Universal Music Plaza Stage at Universal Studios Florida and the Toon Lagoon Amphitheater at Universal's Islands of Adventure, while photo-ops and expos were held between Universal Studios' Soundstage 33 and Soundstage 21. During the event's debut in 2014, the Diagon Alley expansion phase of the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios Florida, which was set to open that same year, was still under construction at the time, raising an expectation of the new area of the theme park among the celebration's attendees. ===Guests in attendance=== Many actors from the films have attended the celebration, some in multiple occasions, including: Matthew Lewis (2014, 2016, 2017), James and Oliver Phelps (2014, 2015, 2018), Evanna Lynch (2014–2016), Devon Murray (2014), Mark Williams (2014), Michael Gambon (2015), Robbie Coltrane (2015), Rupert Grint (2016), Bonnie Wright (2016, 2018), Katie Leung (2016), Tom Felton (2017), Jason Isaacs (2017), Warwick Davis (2017), Stanislav Ianevski (2018) and Natalia Tena (2018). Other attendees have included Kazu Kibuishi, illustrator of the 15th anniversary editions of the Harry Potter book series in the US; graphic designer company MinaLima, led by partners Eduardo Lima and Miraphora Mina, who are the graphic designers of all Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts films; Paul Harris, choreographer of the wand combat scenes of the fifth Harry Potter film; Brian Selznick, illustrator of the 20th anniversary editions of the Harry Potter book series in the US; and Jany Temime, costume designer of the Harry Potter films, from the third to the final film. ==Tributes== After the passing of Alan Rickman in 2016 and John Hurt in 2017, who played Severus Snape and Garrick Ollivander in the films, respectively, attendees paid tribute to both actors. After Rickman's passing, attendees gathered in front of Number 12 Grimmauld Place, outside the London area of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter – Diagon Alley, to raise their wands in his memory. This act was portrayed in the sixth Harry Potter film, after the death of Albus Dumbledore, and has been repeated on informal occasions at the passing of many actors of the Harry Potter films. One attendee placed a single lily in front of the potions storeroom door of the queue of Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey, not only as a symbol of Rickman's passing, but also his character's love for Lily Potter. After Hurt's passing, attendees gathered in front of Ollivander's Wand Shop at both Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade and paid tribute to the actor with their wands in the air as well. ==Cancellation== In September 2018, Universal announced A Celebration of Harry Potter would not take place in 2019 as focus shifted towards the construction of Hagrid's Magical Creatures Motorbike Adventure, which at the time was not yet officially named and opened on June 13, 2019. After no announcement was made for a 2020 edition for a second year in a row, A Celebration of Harry Potter was ultimately cancelled while Universal never made an official announcement regarding its future. ==See also== *List of former Universal Studios Florida attractions *List of former Universal's Islands of Adventure attractions ==References==

39242841	A Celestial Atlas	thumb|Title page. A Celestial Atlas, full title: A Celestial Atlas: Comprising A Systematic Display of the Heavens in a Series of Thirty Maps Illustrated by Scientific Description of their Contents, And accompanied by Catalogues of the Stars and Astronomical Exercises is a star atlas by British author Alexander Jamieson, published in 1822. The atlas includes 30 plates, 26 of which are constellation maps with a sinusoidal projection. In some editions the plates are hand-colored. The atlas includes three new (but now-obsolete) constellations invented by Jamieson: Noctua, Norma Nilotica, and Solarium. Two celestial hemispheres of the atlas are centered on the equatorial poles via polar projection and geocentric alignment. The atlas comprises stars visible only to the naked eye, making it less cluttered. Unlike Johann Elert Bode and Jean Nicolas Fortin, who followed John Flamsteed's depictions of the constellations, Jamieson allowed himself greater artistic expression. The constellation figures in Jamieson's atlas are more realistically drawn, particularly compared to Flamsteed's depictions of Lacerta, Lynx, Cancer, Scorpius and Canis Major. At the same time the atlas' plates were made at the size of those by Bode and Fortin, at approximately 9 in × 7 in (22.5 × 17.5 cm), with the same number of them (26 plus hemispheres) and each covering the same area of sky. Jamieson also followed Bode’s approach of drawing boundary lines between constellations. The atlas was popular and was allowed to be dedicated to King George IV. The drawings in A Celestial Atlas were plagiarised in Urania's Mirror, published a few years later. ==References== ==External links== * Celestial Atlas by Alexander Jamieson Category:1822 non- fiction books Category:Classical star atlases

A Cellarful of Motown! is a series of compilation albums of Motown rarities, containing versions of known songs by alternative artists, as well as demos of songs that were not released at the time, but had been shelved for various reasons. Compiled by Paul Nixon the series ran for 4 volumes before being cancelled by Universal Records. Some of them had failed to pass the selections by Motown executives, in other cases Motown's owner Berry Gordy had his personal reasons to withhold releases. Four examples out of many: * "Danger, Heartbreak Dead Ahead" was a hit for The Marvelettes, but appears in a version by The Contours. * Likewise, Smokey Robinsons "My Heart", once a minor hit for Caroline Crawford, is in this compilation performed by Tammi Terrell. * From Patrice Holloway only one single was released by Motown; two demos she made for the company appear in this compilation. * The Spinners' original song "Too Late I Learned" was recorded but never released, not as a single nor as an album track The series was revived for a fifth volume in September 2020, released by Universal subsidiary label Caroline Records. ==Volume 1== Source: Classic Motown, Allmusic ===Disc One=== ===Disc Two=== ==Volume 2== Source: Discogs, Allmusic ===Disc one=== ===Disc two=== ==Volume 3== Source: Discogs, Allmusic ===Disc one=== ===Disc two=== ==Volume 4== Source: Soulsource, Allmusic ===Disc one=== ===Disc two=== ==References== Category:2002 compilation albums Category:Motown compilation albums Category:Compilation album series Category:Record label compilation albums Category:Soul compilation albums Category:Pop compilation albums Category:Rhythm and blues compilation albums

15344071	A Celtic Requiem	A Celtic Requiem (Requiem for Jenny Jones) is a requiem by the English composer John Tavener, written in 1969. It is written for soprano, children's choir and orchestra. Despite its title, the work is not actually a requiem for anyone in particular. Instead, it takes the rough format of a singing game for children. A character, Jenny Jones, is selected by the children who at one point dance around her to ward off evil spirits. According to the composer, this > though handed down to children, has its origin in a funeral rite in the > lowlands of Scotland.Liner notes to 1970 recording. The piece is composed in three sections which follow the traditional requiem: 'Requiem aeternam', 'Dies irae' and 'Requiescat in pace'. It was premiered by the London Sinfonietta and chorus under David Atherton in August 1969. Shortly afterward the BBC recorded it with the soprano June Barton and the children of Little Missenden Village School and the composer playing the organ. These forces then recorded the work for Apple Records along with two other Tavener pieces: Nomine Jesu and Coplas. The recording was released in 1970, and re- released as a CD (on SAPCOR 20) in 1993. ==References== Category:Requiems Category:Apple Records albums Category:Compositions by John Tavener Category:John Tavener albums Category:1969 compositions

7713606	A Century in Stone	A Century in Stone is a 2004 documentary film by Craig Hornby. It tells the story of how the discovery of ironstone at Eston in 1850 sparked the transformation of Teesside from rural backwater to iron-making capital of the world. Craig Hornby was awarded a prestigious £75,000 NESTA fellowship award to fund the film. Further funding totalling £28,000 came from Northern Arts, Redcar & Cleveland Borough Council, Northern Film & Media, UK Trade & Investment, Teesside University and Middlesbrough Council. Launched in 2004, "A Century in Stone" attracted thousands to clubs and halls across Teesside before becoming the first local film to be shown at a mainstream cinema chain on Teesside. In its first week at UGC Middlesbrough (now Cineworld), it outsold all the other films leading to an extended run of 18 days. In November 2004, the film and director were featured at Sheffield DocFest as part of a seminar on independent film-making. At Xmas 2004, the film became a DVD/VHS bestseller in stores across Teesside. Sales to date exceed 15,000. In August 2005, the film opened at Dendy Cinemas in Sydney Harbour due to Sydney Harbour Bridge being made with Cleveland ironstone/Teesside Steel by Dorman Long of Middlesbrough in 1932. This was followed with screenings in Brisbane, Melbourne, Fremantle, Adelaide and Newcastle NSW. In 2010, the film was selected by the British Film Institute for screening at the BFI Mediatheques on London's South Bank and around the UK. In 2010, audio extracts from the film and interviews on Eston Nab with Craig Hornby were featured in a BBC Radio 4 'Archive on 4' documentary entitled 'Redcar - Made of Steel'. This was produced with Teesside-born actor Felicity Finch in the wake of the first closure of the Redcar Blast Furnace. ==References== ==External links== *A Century in Stone - Pancrack Pictures * Category:2004 films Category:British television films Category:British documentary films Category:Teesside Category:2004 documentary films Category:Documentary films about England Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s British films Category:English-language documentary films

LXXIII) (9240074298) John Gould was working as a taxidermist at the museum of the Zoological Society of London, curating and preserving animal bodies for display or study. When a number of taxidermied birds from the Himalaya Mountains arrived at the society, Gould decided to publish a book describing them. The text was written by Gould's friend and mentor Nicholas Aylward Vigors. The images of the birds were produced using the process of lithography. They were sketched by Gould himself, and drawn and transferred onto stones by Gould’s wife, artist Elizabeth Gould. She worked with Edward Lear to do this. Lear published his own Illustrations of the Family of Psittacidae, or Parrots around the same time. It is said that Gould was inspired by Lear's work. Elizabeth Gould continued to produce drawings for ornithological books until her death in 1841. Unfortunately, a publisher could not be found, and Gould made the decision to publish it himself. The book was printed in stages and issued in 20 monthly parts between 1830 & 1832\.

Jackson wrote A Century of Dishonor in an attempt to change government ideas and policy toward Native Americans at a time when effects of the 1871 Indian Appropriations Act (making the entire Native American population wards of the nation) had begun to draw the attention of the public. Jackson attended a meeting in Boston in 1879 at which Standing Bear, a Ponca, told how the federal government forcibly removed his tribe from its ancestral homeland in the wake of the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation. After meeting Standing Bear, she conducted research at the Astor Library in New York and was shocked by the story of government mistreatment that she found. She wrote in a letter, "I shall be found with 'Indians' engraved on my brain when I am dead.—A fire has been kindled within me which will never go out." Jackson sent a copy of her book to every member of Congress, at her own expense. She hoped to awaken the conscience of the American people, and their representatives, to the flagrant wrongs that had been done to the American Indians, and persuade them "to redeem the name of the United States from the stain of a century of dishonor".Prucha, Francis Paul (1986). The Great Father: The United States Government and the American Indians, p. 208. University of Nebraska Press. . The book consists primarily of the tribal histories of seven different tribes. Among the incidents it depicts is the eradication of Praying Town Indians in the colonial period, despite their recent conversion to Christianity, because it was assumed that all Indians were the same. Her book brought to light the injustices enacted upon the Native Americans as it chronicled the ruthlessness of white settlers in their greed for land, wealth, and power. Upon its publication, A Century of Dishonor received some adverse criticism and was dismissed as "sentimental". But it had some effect in shaking the moral senses of America, and in 1881 Congress acted to remedy, in part, the situation of the Ponca people. However, it did not have quite the impact that Jackson wanted, which spurred her to write an emotional appeal to action in Ramona. Long out of print, A Century of Dishonor was first reprinted in 1964 by Ross & Haines of Minneapolis, Minnesota via a limited printing of 2,000 copies, and has been reprinted numerous times since then. == Synopsis == Originally published in 1881, Helen Hunt Jackson chronicles the treatment of American Indians by the United States beginning in colonial times through to her present. The book can be broken down into four major themes: * the mistreatment of seven major Native American tribes * promises and treaties issued and broken by the United States government to these tribes * forced removal of these (and other) tribes to reservations located on land that was unsuitable for farming or sustaining the Native American way of life * massacres of the Native American people by white Americans. Jackson begins by providing in her "Introductory" a summary of the policies and positions of the United States relative to the Native American population; however, because of the time in which she was writing, she refers to them as Indians. Jackson calls attention to the changes that occurred when the United States took territory from the colonial powers. Most prominently, the United States did not acknowledge or respect Native claims to the land, as recognized by treaties, to the same degree that Spain, Britain, and France had. This was in part, she explains, because the treaties written in English purposefully had different expectations than those written for and signed by the Native populations. She contextualizes her distress by examining the attitudes of the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary from the end of the 18th century through much of the 19th century. She concludes by stating that through their unjust treatment of Native Americans, the United States violated international law and made itself susceptible to a reputation for cruelty. === The Peoples === The seven chapters that follow the introduction each describe the general history of the Delaware, the Cheyenne, the Nez Percé, the Sioux, the Ponca, the Winnebagoes, and the Cherokee, as well as the way their cultures shaped the way the United States took advantage of them. Jackson uses evidence from Official Reports of the War Department or the Department of Interior to show that the United States did not hide the atrocities they committed, nor did they see them as such. In addition to using evidence that the United States provided of their mistreatment of Native Americans, Jackson also took great care to ensure that she included information on how each of the people viewed themselves and how they felt about the way they were treated. For example, at the beginning of her chapter on the Sioux, she provides a history of their name (it comes from the old French word Nadouessioux meaning enemies) but also includes that they refer to themselves as "Dakota." === Massacres === Having shared the legal and cultural trouble that the aforementioned tribes experienced at the hands of the United States, Jackson goes on to provide detailed descriptions of three massacres: The Conestoga Massacre, the Gnadenhütten Massacre, and the Massacres of Apaches, as a demonstration of the violence committed against Native Americans. In addition to explaining the atrocities and violence, Jackson also provides a history of the interactions between the Native Americans and the white population prior to the massacres. === Conclusion === Jackson concludes that "[i]t makes little difference, however, where one opens the record of the history of the Indians; every page and every year has its dark stain." She calls on all branches of government, no matter how difficult the process or how long over due, to right their wrongs. Jackson outlines four changes, the cessation of cheating, robbing, and breaking promises, along with the end of refusing to protect Native American property rights under American law, that she believes are at least a good start to make up for all of the harm that the United States government caused. == Background == Jackson wrote A Century of Dishonor in an attempt to change government ideas/policy toward Native Americans at a time when effects of the 1871 Indian Appropriations Act (making the entire Native American population wards of the nation) had begun to draw the attention of the public. Jackson attended a meeting in Boston in 1879 at which Standing Bear, a Ponca, told how the federal government forcibly removed his tribe from its ancestral homeland in the wake of the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation. After meeting Standing Bear, she conducted research at the Astor Library in New York and was shocked by the story of government mistreatment that she found. She wrote in a letter, "I shall be found with 'Indians' engraved on my brain when I am dead.—A fire has been kindled within me which will never go out." She collected information from a number of sources that shaped her well-rounded approach to understanding the experience of Native Americans and their relationship with the United States. At the start of the book, she provides an appendix of the reports and accounts that she relied on including records of prices that white men paid for scalps (of Native Americans) and personal testimonials of grievances that Sioux had experienced. == Distribution == The book was originally published in 1881 and Hunter personally sent a copy of her book to every member of Congress, at her own expense. She hoped to awaken the conscience of the American people, and their representatives, to the flagrant wrongs that had been done to the American Indians, and persuade them "to redeem the name of the United States from the stain of a century of dishonor". After a long hiatus, the book was first reprinted in 1964 by Ross & Haines of Minneapolis, Minnesota via a limited printing of 2,000 copies. However, this was soon followed by a larger printing from Harper & Row in their Torchbook series in 1965, with an introductory essay by Andrew F. Rolle but without the fifteen documents that served as an appendix of supporting evidence in the original work and its first reprinting. Inspired by the women’s movement of the 1970s, it was not until the 1980s that more extensive attention to Jackson and others like her began to appear in academic journals. == Reception == === Critical response === Initially, some critics, including President Theodore Roosevelt, dismissed her as being a "sentimental historian," which he did in the first appendix to The Winning of the West. However, more than a century later, historian John Milton Cooper countered Roosevelt's dismissal of Jackson's argument by stating that Roosevelt's view of Native American history was "Eurocentric, racist, male-dominated, and environmentally obtuse from a late-twentieth-century point of view." Over time, her work has been recognized for its important impact on the nation's understanding of the mistreatment of Native Americans by the United States and prompted discussion on the role of women's voices in history both publicly and academically. However, critics continue to reference the text as a predecessor to Ramona rather than as a text that stands alone. === Public response === Although there was a good deal of adverse criticism even at the time of its publication, A Century of Dishonor, along with Jackson's many magazine articles, letters to editors, and personal contacts, had an effect, and in March 1887 Congress passed a bill partially rectifying the particular situation of the Ponca people whose cause had first attracted her attention. The Dawes Act was born out of Jackson's efforts and called for the return of Native lands to Native Americans in an act of humanitarian reform. Though it did not come close to fully or successfully addressing all of the grievances that Jackson had expressed. The New York Evangelist, a periodical that existed for most of the 19th century, wrote a review just after the book was published in which they reiterated Jackson's purpose for writing: to draw attention to the disregard of the rights of Native Americans by the United States government and called on the country to adopt a Christian policy toward Native Americans that was both "just and humane." In addition, for decades after it was published, the reporting that Jackson did in A Century of Dishonor was used to justify arguments against government treatment of Native Americans, especially by the Indian Bureau. == Connections to Ramona == Many of the articles that mention A Century of Dishonor from the late 19th and early 20th centuries are reviews of Ramona in which A Century of Dishonor is mentioned as its predecessor and that Jackson's journey to write A Century of Dishonor led her from the east coast to California where she found inspiration for the novel. Christine Holbo argues that, 'The divide separating A Century of Dishonor’s legalistic human rights activism from the kaleidoscopic and even campy aesthetics of Ramona deserves more attention. Undoubtedly, the two projects shared a common concern for the plight of Native Americans in post- Reconstruction America. But their differences suggest, at the very least, a disconnect between means and ends. To the degree to which Ramona can be read as an appeal on behalf of Native American rights, a continuation of the project laid out in A Century of Dishonor, the novel must be read against its romantic interpretation of mission- and Mexican-era California.' Valerie Sherer Mathes, in her book Helen Hunt Jackson and Her Indian Reform Legacy, devotes a single chapter to A Century of Dishonor in which she suggests that while the initial response was lacking in enthusiasm, Jackson’s ‘work had definitely acquainted the public with the deplorable condition of the American Indian,’ but that its greater importance was laying ‘the groundwork for Jackson’s next Indian crusade,’ Ramona. ==References== ==External links== * * A Century of Dishonor at Project Gutenberg Category:1881 non-fiction books Category:Non-fiction books about indigenous peoples of the Americas

3401447	A Ceremony of Carols	A Ceremony of Carols, Op. 28 is an extended choral composition for Christmas by Benjamin Britten scored for three-part treble chorus, solo voices, and harp. The text, structured in eleven movements, is taken from The English Galaxy of Shorter Poems, edited by Gerald Bullett. It is principally in Middle English, with some Latin and Early Modern English. It was composed in 1942 on Britten's sea voyage from the United States to England. Britten composed the music at the same time as the Hymn to St. Cecilia and in similar style. Originally conceived as a series of unrelated songs, it was later unified into one piece with the framing processional and recessional chant in unison based on the Gregorian antiphon "Hodie Christus natus est". A harp solo based on the chant, along with a few other motifs from "Wolcum Yole", also serves to unify the composition. In addition, the movements "This Little Babe" and "Deo Gracias" have the choir reflecting harp-like effects by employing a canon at the first in stretto. The original 1942 publication was written for SSA (soprano, soprano, alto) children's choir. In 1943, a SATB (soprano, alto, tenor, bass) arrangement was published for a mixed choir. Many of the movements are written as rounds or call-and-response pieces – lyrically simple for the sake of the children performing. There are three-part divisi in both the tenor and bass parts. Each of these lines individually mirrors a line in either the soprano or alto parts, as though the tenor and bass sections are a men's choir singing the original SSA composition with an SSA choir. == Movements == === 1. Procession "Hodie Christus natus est" === "Hodie Christus natus est" is a Gregorian antiphon to the Magnificat at Second Vespers of Christmas. It is sung exclusively by the sopranos and is patterned on a traditional processional in Christian church service. It has no time signature and can be sung in flexible tempo. The last several measures can be repeated to allow the whole ensemble to take their places. === 2. Wolcum Yole! === The second movement is an upbeat and festive piece intended to welcome the important days of the coming period: Yule (25th), Saint Stephen's Day (26th), St John's Day (27th), Day of the Innocents (28th), Thomas Becket (29th), New Year, Twelfth Day, Candlemas (2nd Feb). The text is written in Middle English. === 3. There is no rose === The text of "There is no Rose" is kept at Trinity College (MS 0.3.58) and dates to the early 15th century. It presents a more reverent tone than the previous movement, as the choir admires the beauty of the birth of Jesus. The sopranos and altos sing the melody in a soft, prayerful manner, while the rest of the ensemble occasionally joins them to sing in unison. This is a macaronic piece, meaning the text is in both a vernacular language (English, in this case) and Latin. === 4. That yongë child === "That yongë child" consists of a soprano solo with harp accompaniment. The reverent tone from the previous piece carries over into this one, except this piece is more recitative. === 5. Balulalow === The text of "Balulalow" is found written by brothers Wedderburn around 1548. It includes the rest of the ensemble and acts as a contrast to the first part. It has a different keys, rhythm, and an overall more jubilant tone than "That yongë child". "Balulalow" is meant to be a lullaby for the baby Jesus, and the soprano solo at the beginning of the movement paints an image of The Virgin Mary singing a lullaby to her newborn child. === 6. "As Dew in Aprille" === "As Dew in Aprille" was written by Sloane in the first quarter of the 15th century. It switches the focus from the baby to the Virgin Mary in gentle, soothing music which progressively grows softer until the very end. Throughout this movement, the different voice parts overlap to create an echoing effect. The volume of the choir abruptly shifts at the end from pianissississimo (very, very, very softly) to forte (loudly). === 7. This Little Babe === "This Little Babe", from Robert Southwell's Newe Heaven, Newe Warre from 1595, contrasts with every other movement, in a darker approach and often using imagery of hell. It depicts a battle between the baby and Satan (good and evil), which is conveyed in its swift tempo, polyrhythms, overlapping segments between the voices, and the fact that the song grows progressively louder over the duration of the movement. The music reaches its climax with an intense key change and conflicting rhythm from the rest of the piece. === 8. Interlude === This instrumental movement is a harp solo, creating a sense of angelic bliss with its slow tempo, shifting rhythm, and progressively soft nature. === 9. In Freezing Winter Night === "In Freezing Winter Night" is another text by Southwell. This movement calls out to the circumstances of the birth of Jesus and employs the choir to sing in a round to create an echoing effect. The choir and harp progress through the movement at contrasting paces and, over the duration of the piece, gradually synchronise until they both move at the same pace just before the ending when the music fades out. This is meant to symbolise the discord on earth before and during the birth of Christ and the hope of the future and the harmony he brings. === 10. Spring Carol=== "Spring Carol" is on a text which was also set by William Cornysh in the 16th century. Britten set it as a duet between two sopranos that depicts the signs of spring. It originates from a carol set by William Cornysh. This movement ends with a call to thank God, which transitions appropriately to the next movement. === 11. Deo gracias – Adam lay i-bounden === "Deo gracias" (Thanks be to God) is based on a macaronic poem from the 15th century. "Adam lay i-bounden" tells of the events that happened in Chapter 3 of Genesis, the "Fall of Man" as Eve is tricked into eating the fruit of sin. Note the idea of Adam's sin as a 'happy fault,' emphasized by the last stanza - "Blessèd be the time That appil takè was" - introduced by St. Ambrose and St. Augustine and further developed by Thomas Aquinas in the thirteenth century. At the end of the piece, a cross can be displayed in the text to signify the crucifixion of Christ as well as the redemption of mankind. Britten has set the choir in such a way that the choir becomes emphatic in its thanks to God. Use of syncopated (emphasis of the off-beat to create a displacement of rhythm) and staccato (short and detached) rhythms emphasise this energetic thankfulness, while only a small section very quietly recounts the plight of humanity. The harp and choir both gradually grow more resounding until the very last chord. === 12. "Recession" ("Hodie Christus natus est") === This movement is a near mirror of the Procession and the ensemble, typically, performs this piece as they exit the stage. Its melody gradually fades as the ensemble retreats outside of the venue. == Discography == Recordings of the complete work include: * RCA Victor Chorale of women's voices, Robert Shaw conductor, Laura Newell harpist (1952)RCA Victor Red Seal: WDM 1324 (3 45 RPM discs) * Choir of St John's College, Cambridge, George Guest, Marisa Robles (1965)Decca: 430 097-2argo, 1971: SPA/A 164, ZRG 2865 * Choir of King's College, Cambridge, David Willcocks, Osian Ellis (1972)EMI Records: EMI 562 7962 * Wandsworth School Boys' Choir (1972), Susan Drake harpistCeremony - Christmas Music With The Wandsworth Sound - Granada Records - GRT 1005 * Christ Church Cathedral Choir, Oxford (1982)Academy Sound & Vision: ASV CD QS 6030 * Westminster Cathedral Choir (1986)Hyperion: CDA66220 * New London Children's Choir (1995), Ronald Corp, Skaila Kanga (harp)Naxos: 8.553183 * Cincinnati Boychoir (1996) * Robert Shaw Chamber Singers (1997)Telarc: CD-80461, BMG Direct: D 123588 * Australian Boys Choir (2013) * Choir of New College, Oxford, Edward Higginbottom (2013)Novum: NCR1386 * Czech Philharmonic Children's Choir (2017)Supraphon https://www.supraphonline.cz/album/288559-benjamin-britten-a-ceremony-of- carols?trackId=3347779 == References == == Further reading == * Carpenter, Humphrey.

63582800	A Certain Doom	"A Certain Doom" is the sixteenth episode and second-part finale of the tenth season of the post-apocalyptic horror television series The Walking Dead, which aired on AMC on October 4, 2020. The episode's teleplay was written by Corey Reed, from a story by Jim Barnes, Eli Jorné and Reed, and directed by Greg Nicotero. The episode was originally scheduled to air on April 12, 2020 as the season finale. However, AMC announced on March 24, 2020 that post- production to the episode was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and instead aired on October 4, 2020. AMC also announced that the tenth season would include six additional episodes, which aired from February 28 to April 4, 2021. This episode also marks the return of Maggie Greene (Lauren Cohan), who had been absent since the previous season episode "What Comes After". The episode received positive reviews from critics. ==Plot== Engaging the final battle of the Whisperer War, Beta has led the gigantic horde to the Tower, where the survivors inside scramble to adjust their plan for survival. Gabriel orders several pairs of survivors to sneak pieces of a speaker system out past the horde onto a wagon to be pulled by horses, which the survivors will use to play music and lure the horde to the ocean to destroy them. Daryl, Carol, Jerry, Magna, Luke, Kelly, Beatrice, and Jules decide to venture through the horde covered in walker guts to engineer the escape plan. Before Carol departs, Lydia makes amends with her, but Carol instead insists to Lydia that she needs to make her own way. The group begin sifting through the horde, with Whisperers being picked off by archers. Most of the group manages to evade the horde and flee into the woods. Carol manages to mortally wound a Whisperer that attacks her and Beatrice, but the dying Whisperer wounds Beatrice, forcing Carol to leave her behind as she is discovered and killed by the horde. The survivors set up Luke's sound system and begin playing Talking Heads' "Burning Down the House" on repeat, successfully luring the horde away from the Tower, and giving the people inside an opportunity to escape. Beta and most of the Whisperers stay with the horde, and catch up to the wagon as night falls, killing Hilltop soldier Oscar and destroying the speakers after forcing the group to retreat and abandon the wagon. Hiding in the woods, and without any other plans, Daryl orders the group to go back and hunt down the Whisperers in the horde one by one. Lydia volunteers to continue to lead the horde away, since her mother taught her how; Daryl rebuffs her, but Lydia, however, is adamant. Daryl decides they will deal with it later and tells the others to move. Meanwhile at the Tower, most of the group has evacuated thanks to the absence of the horde, but Gabriel stays behind to hold off the remaining Whisperers. Gabriel is nearly killed, but he is saved by a hooded, masked warrior in the company of Maggie Greene, who has returned after reading a letter from Carol informing her about the Whisperers. The pair were also able to save Aaron and Alden from a group of Whisperers that had surrounded them earlier. Outside, Beta notices the Whisperers around him are being killed by the survivors. He then spots Lydia and prepares to attack her, but is interrupted by Negan. Seeking revenge for Negan's assassination of Alpha, he furiously charges at Negan and tackles him to the ground, and prepares to finish him off. Suddenly, Daryl intervenes and stabs Beta in each eye, saving Negan in the process. The two then watch as Beta is consumed and devoured by the walkers; in his final moments, Beta remembers the Whisperers' creed of embracing all death and smiles happily as he imagines the horde embracing him. Once Beta's mask is ripped off, Negan recognizes him from before the apocalypse, but Daryl shrugs it off. Come daytime, Lydia, wearing Alpha's mask, successfully leads the horde to a cliff, intending this task as a suicide mission. Before she can go over, Lydia is stopped by Carol, who volunteers to go instead of her, dubbing it her choice. Carol reaches the edge, but before she can step off, Lydia pulls her back. The pair take cover and embrace behind a rock, as the walkers around them march off the cliff into the waters below. As Carol thanks Lydia, the latter rips off her mother's mask and tosses it over the cliff. With the Whisperers no longer a threat, the survivors regroup in the woods outside the Tower. There, Maggie reunites with Judith while Daryl asks Carol if she got what she wanted. She replies that she didn't, but didn't really want it anyway. Daryl tells her that she still has him; they hug. Elsewhere, Connie is revealed to be alive, albeit weak and malnourished. After collapsing on the road, she is found by Virgil, who is revealed to have returned to the mainland and traveled to Oceanside only to find it empty. At night, Eugene's group has finally reached the trainyard which was designated as the intended rendezvous point to meet Stephanie. After suffering a bicycle crash earlier, Eugene initially believes he has missed his meeting with Stephanie, but declares they'll continue to go looking for her after being inspired by Ezekiel. The group is then suddenly accosted by a large group of heavily armed soldiers wearing white and red body armor, who order them to drop their weapons and get on their knees at gunpoint. ==Production== "A Certain Doom" had initially been planned as the tenth season finale to air on April 12, 2020, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic, AMC announced on March 24, 2020 that the episode would be delayed. Showrunner Angela Kang explained that while the episode had completed filming, the work on post-production visual effects could not be completed on time due to the pandemic. The episode's airdate was confirmed in July 2020 for October 4, 2020, as well as six additional episodes to the tenth season, which aired from February 28 to April 4, 2021, since the eleventh and final season would be delayed due to the pandemic. Lauren Cohan returned to the series in her role as Maggie Greene, who had left the series in the ninth season after being cast for a leading role in the ABC television series Whiskey Cavalier. Cohan and the showrunners had not considered her character to be written off the series completely then, and left the potential for her return in later seasons depending on Cohan's availability. With the cancellation of Whiskey Cavalier after one season, Cohan was able to return as a series regular for the final season, which allowed the showrunners to work her character into the ongoing plot. The episode also marks the departure of Ryan Hurst, who portrayed Beta since the previous season episode "Guardians", as his character is stabbed by Daryl (Norman Reedus) and then devoured by walkers. The selection of Talking Heads' "Burning Down the House" was a choice made after the script was completed, calling only for some piece of rock music to help draw the walkers away from the hospital. Kang said many of the staff were Talking Heads fans and were drawn to the song since its lyrics matched the theme of the scene with the survivors up against impossible odds. The song itself was an expensive piece of music to license for the episode, but other options they tried did not work as well, so they opted to pay more for the rights. The episode also introduces the Commonwealth, a large community that is central to the last major arc in the comic book series. According to Kang, they had intended to have the season ten finale end with the Commonwealth's introduction. ==Reception== ===Critical reception=== "A Certain Doom" received positive reviews. On Rotten Tomatoes, the episode has an approval rating of 89% with an average score of 6.80 out of 10, based on 18 reviews. The site's critical consensus reads: "The Whisperers are finally shushed for good in 'A Certain Doom,' a tidy climax that efficiently dispenses with old enemies while teeing up a fresh crop of antagonists." Jeffrey Lyles, who writes for Lyles Movie Files, gave it an 8/10 rating, writing: "This didn't feel as satisfying as it was months after Negan killed Alpha and Beta vowed revenge, but in binge format I'm betting this will feel like a well-earned payoff." Ron Hogan of Den of Geek gave the episode a 4/5 rating, praising Nicotero's direction, and wrote: "One thing you can say about Greg Nicotero as a director, he knows exactly how he wants his special effects to look, and he shoots them in their full glory." Writing for Insider, Kirsten Acuna gave the episode a B+ rating, writing: "I wouldn't exactly call it much of a war. However, it's still a satisfying conclusion to what has been one of the most enjoyable seasons of "TWD" in years where Kang made major changes from the comics." John Doyle of The Globe and Mail also praised the episode, writing: "It's grim but passing- good, like our lives now." Writing for IGN, Matt Fowler gave the episode an average rating of 7/10 and praised the episode, writing: "The Walking Dead's Season 10 finale contained solid thrills and appropriately tense moments but it faltered when it came to larger, memorable story beats." Writing for The A.V. Club, Alex McLevy gave the episode a B, writing: "The back half of season 10 has been strong, and this installment makes for a fitting conclusion, given that it also dispatches its threat with a minimum of fuss." Richard Rys, who writes for Vulture, gave the episode an average rating of 3/5, writing: "Maybe this episode will hold up better under a binge-watching schedule, but waiting so long for a fairly predictable end to long-dangling story lines felt a bit anticlimactic." Erik Kain of Forbes praised the episode, writing: "Overall this was a perfectly fine season finale. I have some gripes but they [sic] biggest one is just that it felt kind of flat compared to earlier episodes this season." ===Ratings=== "A Certain Doom" received 2.73 million viewers, down from the previous episode's rating. ==References== ==External links== *"A Certain Doom" at AMC * Category:2020 American television episodes Category:The Walking Dead (season 10) episodes
57667802	A Certain Girl	"A Certain Girl" is a rhythm and blues song written by Allen Toussaint, with the credit listed under his pen name Naomi Neville. New Orleans R&B; singer Ernie K-Doe recorded it in 1961. Minit Records released the song as the B-side of "I Cried My Last Tear". The single became a double-sided hit on Billboard magazine's Hot 100 record chart, with "A Certain Girl" reaching number 71 (and "I Cried My Last Tear" number 69) during on December 4, 1961. Neither song appeared on Billboard's Hot R&B; sides chart. Over the years, K-Doe's original "A Certain Girl" has been included on several compilations and a variety of musicians have recorded versions of the song. ==The Yardbirds rendition== ===Background=== "A Certain Girl" was one of the first songs recorded by English rock band the Yardbirds. At the time, the group were a part of the early British rhythm and blues scene that produced bands such as the Rolling Stones and drew their repertoire from American blues and rhythm and blues artists such as Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Bo Diddley. They had heard K-Doe's song on a London Records compilation album featuring Minit Records R&B; artists titled We Sing the Blues (1963). ===Recording and release=== With Eric Clapton on lead guitar, the Yardbirds first attempted a recording in January 1964 at the R. G. Jones Studios, Surrey, England. A 12-inch acetate demo (co-produced by Mike Vernon) was pressed for an EMI audition (released on the Yardbirds anthologies Train Kept A-Rollin' – The Complete Giorgio Gomelsky Productions (1993) and Glimpses 1963–1968 (2011)). In March 1964, a second attempt was made at Olympic Studios in London that yielded the master recording. Produced by manager Giorgio Gomelsky, the song was planned as the A-side for the Yardbirds' first single; however, their version of "I Wish You Would" (recorded during the same session) was used instead, with "A Certain Girl" becoming the B-side. The single was released by EMI subsidiary Columbia Graphophone Company in May 1964. In August, Epic Records released the single in the US, but it failed to chart (both songs were included on the Yardbirds' first Epic album For Your Love (1965)). ===Reception=== Although "A Certain Girl" is a brief 2:15, Clapton manages a nearly half-minute guitar solo that Gomelsky describes as a "fat and fuzzy guitar riff". Yardbirds biographer Alan Clayson compared it to "high-velocity flash... his break has almost a separate life from the rest of the number." Yardbirds drummer Jim McCarty felt that the song was "too clean, too sparkling and it even had a hint of 'novelty song'" perhaps due to Gomelsky's production and the repeated "yeah" interjections. In his autobiography, Clapton described the early recordings as sounding "pretty lame. We just sounded young and white... I felt just that we were falling short of the mark in some way." However, music journalist Cub Koda was more indulging: "If you can get past the Andy Hardy backups, you have a pretty catchy ditty [that] must have caught the ears of Warren Zevon". Future Yardbird Jimmy Page provided the lead guitar for a 1964 version by English group the First Gear (included on Jimmy Page: Session Man, Vol. 1 (1989)). ==Versions by other artists== Warren Zevon recorded "A Certain Girl" in 1980, with Jackson Browne on backing vocals. Released as a single from his album, Bad Luck Streak in Dancing School, it reached number 57 on the Hot 100 and number 57 on the Cash Box Top 100. In Canada, it reached number 61. Record World called it a "a hot rocker" and said that "Waddy Wachtel provides the guitar sparks and the Jackson Browne/Rick Marotta chorus is cute & catchy." The 2002 re-release of Better Late Than Never, the 1996 debut album by The Slackers, features a cover of the song as a previously unreleased bonus track. The song's writer Allen Toussaint performed the song as a part of a medley of some of his hits in the 2005 documentary film Make It Funky!. It presents a history of New Orleans music and its influence on rhythm and blues, rock and roll, funk and jazz. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * ==External links== * *: List of the Yardbirds single releases * Category:1961 songs Category:1961 singles Category:1964 singles Category:1980 singles Category:Songs written by Allen Toussaint Category:Minit Records singles Category:Columbia Graphophone Company singles Category:Epic Records singles Category:Asylum Records singles Category:The Yardbirds songs Category:Warren Zevon songs
65991476	A Certain Hunger	A Certain Hunger is a debut novel by writer Chelsea G. Summers. It tells the story of serial killer Dorothy Daniels, a successful food writer who also eats men. Published in print by Unnamed Press on December 1, 2020, A Certain Hunger was widely praised, drawing comparisons to Raymond Chandler and Bret Easton Ellis. == Publication history == Summers began writing the novel in 2011, spurred by heartbreak as well as a desire to move away from the first-person non-fiction she had previously been writing; it ultimately took her six years to finish the book. A Certain Hunger was first published as an audiobook on the Amazon Audible Originals label in the fall of 2019. On December 1, 2020, Unnamed Press published the first print edition. == Plot == The book follows food writer Dorothy Daniels, who is also a convicted serial killer. Daniels narrates the story of her crimes from prison, moving back and forth in time between her life behind bars and the life that led to her imprisonment: specifically the food she ate, including eating men. == Themes == In The New York Times, Amy Silverberg noted the feminist argument conveyed by the murderous protagonist: "Why is it that women have been kept out of so many industries, including Patrick Bateman-style serial murders? Because, Dorothy thinks, people don't want to believe women can do the job. ‘Feminism comes to all things,’ she says, ‘but it comes to recognizing homicidal rage the slowest.’" Writing in The New Republic, Josephine Livingston also emphasized this dimension of the novel, saying it complicates "‘ironic misandry’ schtick" and transforms it "into something complicated and engaging." Instead of a conventional "rape-revenge plot, [the] precision and passion Dorothy bring to murder have a stronger relation to her obsession with food: She has an intense sexual relationship with a kosher butcher, for example." Silverberg notes too that A Certain Hunger is "also a history of the internet, and how it has democratized writing and ‘steamrolled the playing field’ of criticism broadly." == Style == In The New Republic, Livingston compares Summers’s epicurean sensibilities with Patrick Süskind's writing in his novel Perfume, likewise "the story of a lone-wolf killer gifted with an extraordinary sensory palate, which eggs him on to violent frenzy." Suskïnd's protagonist Grenouille detects smells with an intensity and attention to detail akin to the way Daniels "experiences flavor [...] and in both books the collective weight of sensory images slowly creates something like an ethic of murder, posing violence as a creative act with an inevitable relationship to other forms of art—murder as a tribute to beauty." In The New York Times, Silverberg noted the book's noir style, saying, "A Certain Hunger has the voice of a hard- boiled detective novel, as if metaphor-happy Raymond Chandler handed the reins over to the sexed-up femme fatale and really let her fly." At the same time, critics noted the novel's comedic tone: Vanity Fair called it a "satire of a particular brand of foodieism." In the Los Angeles Times, Bethanne Patrick says Summers's “obviously ironic blitheness in fact calls back to Sondheim and Swift." == Reception == The novel's publication drew broad praise from critics, with a "rave" response on literary review aggregator Book Marks, based on eight reviews. A Certain Hunger received a starred review in Publishers Weekly, which described the novel as "fiendishly entertaining" and praised Summer's "shocking and darkly funny novel" as a "feminist-horror version of American Psycho." Writing for Times, Silverberg said, "With Summers's writing, I kept rereading sentences only as a double take, whispering to myself, ‘Man, this lady is screwed up’— which is, I'd argue, its own kind of pleasure." In The New Republic, Livingston called the book "a toothsome morsel" and "a swaggering, audacious debut, and a celebration of all the wet, hot pleasures of human contact." == References == Category:2020 American novels Category:Novels about serial killers Category:Novels about cannibalism Category:Sexuality in novels Category:Feminist novels Category:Novels about writers Category:Neo-noir novels Category:American satirical novels Category:2020 debut novels
2935235	A Certain Justice	A Certain Justice is an Adam Dalgliesh novel by P. D. James, published in 1997.

She successfully defends Garry Ashe against the charge of the murder of his aunt but is unprepared when her daughter flaunts her emotional involvement with him. Venetia is murdered in her office soon after her trial. Adam Dalgliesh investigates what appears to be an inside job.

It is also a comment on the limitations of the criminal justice system. ==Reception== In a 1997 book review for The New York Times, Ben Mcintyre called the book "vintage James" and summarized it as "a book in which revenge is not quite sated and deserts are not always just.

47307911	A Certain Kind of Death	A Certain Kind of Death is a 2003 American documentary film examining what happens to the bodies of those who die with no next of kin. The film was awarded a Documentary Special Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and a Jury Award for Best Documentary at the Atlanta Film Festival. ==Synopsis== In 2001, the Los Angeles County Coroner's Office investigates deaths, including those of people lacking next of kin. Field workers enter residences to perform initial investigation and to remove the bodies, while office workers examine the decedents' personal papers, attempting to contact relatives or friends. The body of Ronald Eugene Tanner is discovered in his apartment. Preceded in death by his immediate family, Tanner lacked next of kin. A gay man, Tanner was also preceded in death by his partner James Fuller, who died of AIDS in 1993. At the time of Fuller's death, Tanner had arranged for Fuller's burial at Hollywood Hills Cemetery, using a plot he owned. Tanner's apartment is decorated with several artworks, including a large, framed California State Flag. The Coroner's office works other cases. Donald Eugene Wright is found dead in a motel room following a welfare check, and machinist Tommy Ray Albertson is also found dead at his residence. Having used his plot to bury Fuller, Tanner left instructions for his body to be buried at a family plot in Mendocino, California. The cemetery manager determines that the family plot is full, and Tanner's body is buried in a nearby plot. The county's process for managing deaths also involves the decedents' financials. Albertson's tools and Tanner's artworks—including the large California flag—are collected from their apartments and sold at an estate sale; the Coroner's office uses the proceeds of decedents' personal effects to defray the costs of its own work and also to pay for funeral arrangements. After a few months of investigation, the Coroner's office determines that no further progress can be made with the cases of Wright and Albertson, and both bodies are sent with a group of others to a morgue, and eventually to a crematorium. Workers break the bodies down to bone fragments, including their skulls, which are aglow in the flames of the cremator. The bone fragments are then ground to ash, and the cremains are stored in small metal boxes for a period of a few years, until finally they are buried in a mass grave, unmarked except for a small plaque showing the decedents' shared year of death. The film ends with the burial of people who died in 1997, the final step which will later be taken with the cremains of Wright and Albertson. ==External links== * * Category:2003 films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about death Category:2000s English-language films Category:2000s American films

11066006	A Certain Magical Index	is a Japanese light novel series written by Kazuma Kamachi and illustrated by Kiyotaka Haimura, which has been published by ASCII Media Works under their Dengeki Bunko imprint since April 2004 in a total of three separate series. The first ran from April 2004 to October 2010, the second from March 2011 to July 2019, and the third from February 2020 to present. The plot is set in a world where supernatural abilities exist. The light novels focus on Toma Kamijo, a young high school student in Academy City with an unusual ability in his right hand as he encounters an English nun named Index. His ability, which allows him to cancel other powers by touching them, and relationship with Index prove dangerous to other sorcerers and espers who wanted to discover the secrets behind him and Index, as well as the city. A manga adaptation by Chuya Kogino began serialization in Monthly Shōnen Gangan since April 2007. J.C.Staff produced two 24-episode anime series between 2008 and 2011. An animated film was released in February 2013. A 26-episode third season aired between 2018 and 2019. Several spin-offs and other adaptations have also been made, including several video games. After being rejected for the Dengeki Novel Prize, Kamachi was contacted by Kazuma Miki, an editor at ASCII Media Works who had him write several test novels. He got the chance to write a full series and decided to create it with the concept of exploring the rules of magic, rather than just having it exist, and the inclusion of science to oppose its elements. The resulting series has seen success with both critics and audiences, with critics praising the action and characters. ==Synopsis== ===Setting=== A Certain Magical Index is set in a world where supernatural abilities are a reality. Individuals who possess special powers acquired via science are called . Those Espers who gain their abilities without the aid of special scientific instruments, whether at birth or otherwise, are referred to as . Others, known as , gain their powers upon mastering the power of magic, either from obtaining knowledge from different mythologies or by using mystical artifacts, although the existence of sorcerers is a secret to the public. While Sorcerers align themselves with different beliefs, Espers are aligned with scientific institutions. This leads to a power struggle between the magic and science factions for control of the world. ===Plot=== The story is set in , a technologically advanced independent city-state located in the west of Tokyo, Japan known for its educational and research institutions. Toma Kamijo is a student in Academy City whose right hand's power called the Imagine Breaker could negate any supernatural powers but also his luck, much to his chagrin. One day, Toma meets a young English girl named Index, a nun from Necessarius, a secret magic branch of the Church of England, whose mind had been implanted with the Index Librorum Prohibitorum – 103,000 forbidden magical books the Church stored in secret locations. His encounter with her leads him to meet others from the secret worlds of science and magic. Toma's unusual power places him at the center of conflicts between the Sorcerers and Espers in Academy City who planned to unravel the secrets behind Academy City, Index, and Toma's special power. Besides its manga adaptation, the series also has four spin-offs focusing on other characters. One of them is A Certain Scientific Railgun, which focuses on Mikoto Misaka, an Electromaster and the third most powerful Esper in Academy City. The second, A Certain Scientific Accelerator, focuses on Accelerator, a teenager capable of controlling vectors and the most powerful Esper in Academy City. The third, A Certain Scientific Dark Matter, deals with the second most powerful Esper in Academy City named Teitoku Kakine and his past. The fourth, A Certain Scientific Mental Out, follows the fifth Level 5 Esper and most powerful psychological psychic named Misaki Shokuhō in her election campaign for the next president of Tokiwadai Middle School's student body. ==Development== Kazuma Kamachi started his work with A Certain Magical Index when he received a call from Kazuma Miki, the light novel editor, after his submission was rejected at the 9th Dengeki Game Novel Prize (now Dengeki Novel Prize) in 2002. Miki began to train him in writing multiple test novels, including a story about a girl sister and a boy with a mysterious arm which became the basis for his light novel. In his essay titled If It's Interesting Anything Goes: 600 Million Copies Printed—The Day in the Life of a Certain Editor, Miki stated that the light novel was originally called but he chose the current title because the word "Index" left a "strong personality in the sense and direction" upon his reading of the manuscript. Kamachi revealed that Index's name was derived on the kanji he found from looking on the encyclopedia since he wanted a name that would "stand out for the character the story was centered around". He avoided using difficult kanji for Toma Kamijo's name to help readers able to read it but he kept the meaning behind the character's epithet ("The One who Purifies God and Slays Demons") a secret for now. When it came the time to write the story, Kamachi investigated the terms "sorcerer" and "real" online for him to build the world of magic and the magicians' existence in his light novel. He also realized that most other Dengeki Bunko novels had magic as a main theme, however, none of them actually invested much into its inner-workings. As such, he decided to use this as the premise for the series. In setting up the world of science, Kamachi "needed some kind of power to oppose" the magic side. This helped him to create the idea of Toma Kamijo's known power, the Imagine Breaker, and set the stage for the world-building of Academy City "where science, espers, and magic would gather". Upon the release of the first volume of the light novel, Miki stated that "(to be blunt) it sold like crazy. Shortly after the official release date, we had to do a reprint half the size of the original printing. It was on a Monday. I still remember it now. It was quite an achievement for an unknown newcomer". After the success of the first volume, the second volume was completed in 17 days. Subsequent volumes were also completed quickly, with the story for the ninth volume completed before the release of the fifth volume. ==Media== ===Light novels=== A Certain Magical Index is a light novel series written by Kamachi and illustrated by Kiyotaka Haimura.

Kazuma Miki, the light novel editor, wanted to make changes during the process of adapting the light novel into anime but felt a "double-edged sword" when thinking how to bring "Kamachi's color" to it and what fans would find interesting.

The series adapted the first to the sixth volume of the light novel. ===Casting=== Atsushi Abe, Yuka Iguchi, Rina Satō, and Satomi Arai reprise their respective roles from the drama CD of the series, which was released in 2007, as Toma Kamijo, Index, Mikoto Misaka, and Kuroko Shirai.

She rated the season 2 out of 5 stars, stating that it "isn't a total loss, but... was a bit of a tedious series". ===Accolade=== Abe won Best Rookie at the 4th Seiyu Awards for his role as Toma Kamijo. ==Note== ==References== ==External links== * Official website * * Category:2008 anime television series debuts Category:A Certain Magical Index Category:A Certain Magical Index episode lists Category:J.C.Staff Category:Television episodes about cloning

360208	A Certain Ratio	A Certain Ratio (abbreviated as ACR) are an English post-punk band formed in Greater Manchester, Lancashire in 1977 by Peter Terrell (guitar, electronics) and Simon Topping (vocals, trumpet), Jez Kerr (bass guitar, vocals), Martin Moscrop (trumpet, guitar), Donald Johnson (drums), and Martha Tilson (vocals) joining soon after. Among the first white indie groups to draw heavy influence from funk as well as disco and Latin percussion, the band were among the first to debut on Tony Wilson's Factory Records in 1979 with "All Night Party," produced by Martin Hannett. During ACR's early years with Factory, they scored seven Top Ten UK independent releases, highlighted by "Flight" and "Waterline," and released five studio albums beginning with The Graveyard and the Ballroom (1980). Following late 1980s and early 1990s phases with major- label A&M; and Rob Gretton's independent Robs Records, ACR were intermittently active. They returned to the studio for their ninth studio album Mind Made Up (2008) and since then have continued to perform, with their back catalogue recirculated through an arrangement with Mute Records. They released their first new album in 12 years, ACR Loco in September 2020 followed by 3 EP's A, C and R in 2021 2023 saw them release their eleventh studio album, 1982 ==History== ===The Factory era=== The band was formed by singer Simon Topping and guitar and electronics player Peter Terrell, who after initially performing as a duo, were soon joined by bassist and vocalist Jez Kerr and then guitarist and trumpeter Martin Moscrop, the band playing without a drummer for a year.Rowland, Mark (2009) "A Certain Ratio Interview", Penny Black Music, 11 January 2009. Retrieved 2 December 2018 The band's name is taken from the lyric of Brian Eno's song "The True Wheel" from his solo studio album Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy) (1974).Nice, James (2010), Shadowplayers: The Rise and Fall of Factory Records, Aurum Press, . p.42 Their early influences included the Velvet Underground, Kraftwerk, the Pop Group, Pere Ubu, Wire, Brian Eno,Sleeve notes - A Certain Ratio, Early (Soul Jazz) LP.

The session included “Do The Du”, “All Night Party”, “Flight” and “Choir” and was broadcast on 17 October. ACR played their first tour of bigger venues as the support act on the Talking Heads' UK tour in December 1979. There are suggestions that watching ACR perform encouraged David Byrne and Talking Heads to go in a more funky musical direction.Sleeve notes (James Nice, March 2005) - A Certain Ratio, I'd Like to See You Again (LTM) CD ====The Graveyard and the Ballroom==== Their next release, the cassette-only compilation of demos and live tracks The Graveyard and the Ballroom, was released in January 1980. The Graveyard side of the album was recorded at Graveyard Studios, Prestwich, Manchester in September 1979, while The Ballroom side was a live recording of ACR’s October 1979 gig at the Electric Ballroom, London. Martin Moscrop started a second band in 1980, Swamp Children (the name later changed to Kalima), that would go on to share several members with A Certain Ratio. In July 1980, the band's second single, a cover version of Banbarra's "Shack Up", recorded at a cost of £50, was released. This was followed in November with "Flight" on 12", which saw their first placing on the UK Independent Chart, peaking at no. 7.Lazell, Barry (1997) Indie Hits 1980–1989, Cherry Red Books, , p. 1 "Shack Up" got a US release in January 1981, going on to peak at no. 46 on the Billboard Dance Club Songs chart,"A Certain Ratio", Billboard. Retrieved 3 December 2018 and the band expanded to a six-piece with the addition of former Occult Chemistry singer Martha Tilson, with Topping focusing on trumpet and percussion. ====To Each...==== The expanded line-up recorded their debut studio album, To Each... The album was recorded in New Jersey with Martin Hannett producing, and released in May 1981. It topped the UK Independent Chart. To Each... represents a development in the ACR sound from the raw harshness of The Graveyard and The Ballroom to a percussion-based post-punk funk. They recorded a second Peel session in June 1981. The session, which included "Knife Slits Water", "Day One" and "Skipscada", was broadcast on 2 July. ACR finished the year with the single "Waterline", which was another top 10 indie chart hit. "Waterline" was the first record self-produced by the group. All of ACR’s previous recordings had been produced by Factory's Martin Hannett but the band wanted a different sound. "We thought he was making us sound too much like Joy Division" (Martin Moscrop, ACR). "Waterline" has a more funk and jazz sound than earlier recordings. ====Sextet==== The band's third studio album, Sextet, followed in January 1982, now incorporating elements of acid jazz, funk, and latin music, and again topped the indie albums chart, also peaking at no. 55 on the UK Albums Chart. The band’s recent stay in New York had increased the Latin, jazz and Cuban percussion influences in their music. Sextet was the first album that was self-produced by ACR and is closer to the sound the band wanted and their live performances. ACR rate Sextet as one of their stand out albums.Sleeve notes - A Certain Ratio, Sextet CD (Factory Benelux, 2014) In February 1982 they released the dub reggae single "Abracadubra" under the pseudonym 'Sir Horatio'. ACR had further indie charting singles that year with "Guess Who?" and "Knife Slits Water". The group recorded a third Peel session in November, now without Tilson, but with Andy Connell added on keyboards and percussion. This session saw the group show more of a jazz influence in the three tracks ("Who's to Say", "Piu Lento" and "Touch") which were broadcast on the John Peel show of 1 December 1982. ====I'd Like to See You Again==== The band's fourth studio album, I'd Like to See You Again, was released in November 1982, reaching no. 2 on the indie albums chart. “The new music offered disciplined latin disco, inspired in part by Cameo.” The album received mixed reviews. “ACR aren’t sounding like ACR anymore so much as the latest New York disco imports” (New Musical Express, 1982) “I’d Like to See You Again represented an aesthetic low. In striving for a more accessible sound, the group had become overly clinical.” (Adrian Thrills, New Musical Express, August 1985) The band's two founding members, Topping and Terrell, left the band in late 1982. Simon Topping recorded a solo single before forming T-Coy with former Quando Quango (and later M People member) Mike Pickering. ==== "I Need Someone Tonight" ==== The band regrouped and returned in October 1983 with the single "I Need Someone Tonight" (with Carol McKenzie on vocals), another top-10 indie hit. ==== "Life's a Scream" and "Wild Party" ==== Tony Quigley (of Kalima) joined on saxophone, and the band released three singles in late 1984 and 1985 – "Life's a Scream" (December 1984), "Brazilia" (February 1985) and "Wild Party" (June 1985). ====The Old and the New==== The Old and the New, a compilation album bringing together many of the non-album singles released from ACR's formation up to the end of 1985, came out on Factory Records in January 1986. The tracks "Flight", "And Then Again" and "Blown Away" were taken from a 12” released in 1980. "Do the Du" and "Fox" were lifted from a single that came out in 1981. "Life's a Scream" and "There's Only This" were the two tracks on a 12" released at the end of 1984. "Wild Party" and "Sounds Like Something Dirty" originally appeared as a 12" in 1985. An additional 7" single that made the centrepiece of the front cover of the compilation album included "Shack Up", which came out as a single in 1980, and “Thin Boys”, which was the B-side on ACR's very first single. Connell left in 1985 to form Swing Out Sister, whose singer Corinne Drewery guested on ACR's next studio album, Force (1986), their last for Factory. ====Force==== Force was released on Factory Records in November 1986. The album received good reviews from the music press. In January 1986 ACR performed live on Channel 4 music show The Tube. ===1989–1997: A&M;, Rob's Records, and Creation Records=== New releases were sparse during the next two years. Dojo Records released a 1985 live recording as Live in America in February 1987, and Italian label Materiali Sonori released the Greeting Four EP five months later. The band signed with A&M; Records in 1987, the line-up now Kerr, Moscrop, Johnson, and Quigley, the first releases for the label the singles "The Big E" and "Backs to the Wall", which preceded the studio album Good Together, released in September 1989. A 50–minute recording of a live show from London was broadcast on British television in October. They also set up their own SoundStation studio in Manchester. The band's only significant chart success with A&M; came with the 1990 single "Won't Stop Loving You", which peaked at no. 55 on the UK Singles Chart, although the first two singles also made the lower reaches of the chart. The studio album acr:mcr (1990) followed, but the band were then dropped from the label. In 1991, they signed with Rob's Records, owned by New Order manager and former Factory Records partner Rob Gretton, releasing a string of singles and the album Up in Dowsnville (1992).Colin Larkin, ed. The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and New Wave, s.v. "A Certain Ratio." (Middlesex: Guinness Publishing: Middlesex, 1992), 5. In 1994, Creation Records began reissuing the band's albums on the Rev-Ola sub-label, and also released two EPs of remixes. The band's first original material for almost three years was released in August 1996, with the live Soundstation Volume 1 EP, followed in November with the Change the Station studio album. A second Soundstation live EP was released in March 1997, the band's last release for some time. In 2002 Soul Jazz Records reissued the albums with bonus tracks (but using the same masters as the Creation editions). Further re-issues and a live recording from 1980 were also made available on the LTM label. ===2000s return=== The band played occasional live shows between 2002 and 2007, and performed in the US for the first time since 1985 on 16 November 2008, headlining the Part Time Punks festival at The Echo in Los Angeles, releasing a new studio album Mind Made Up the same month, on French label Le Maquis. They performed a headline set at the Offset Festival in London in September 2009, playing alongside fellow post-punk artists the Slits, following a one-off live performance commemorating Factory Records in Dublin, in March that year. They performed at the Plan K, Molenbeek in West Brussels on 12 December 2009 as part of the event, 'A Factory Night (And Then Again)'. This event also featured Section 25, the Wake, the Names and Biting Tongues. Towards the end of 2009, the band announced a live appearance at a fund- raising event at Brighton's Concorde 2 venue on 7 March 2010. Their 2008 studio album, Mind Made Up was re-issued via LTM Recordings during 2010, along with a redux version of the 1986 studio album, Force. In 2018, Mute Records began reissuing their back catalogue, they released acr:set, an album of mostly old tracks with two new tracks, one ("Dirty Boy") recorded with Barry Adamson of Magazine and featuring a recording of Tony Wilson, and undertook a tour of the UK with dates in Ireland and Finland.Rettig, James (2018) "A Certain Ratio – “Dirty Boy”", Stereogum, 8 August 2018.

Retrieved 8 December 2018 They released a box set, a 40th anniversary retrospective named acr:box, in May 2019 and toured in support of this. It consists of 53 songs providing a detailed career overview to date. After collecting their past on 2019's ACR: Box collection, A Certain Ratio has released ACR Loco in September 2020. Their first album of new material in 12 years. Featuring three original band members – Jez Kerr, Martin Moscrop, and Donald Johnson – along with members of the band's current live ensemble. Loco finds the band in an expansive, jazzy, danceable state of mind. Musically, A Certain Ratio sound far removed from their post-punk roots now, relying more on their sound's dance and funk elements. Operating at a seemingly unstoppable pace since a string of tours in 2018 and 2019, the new album 1982 was recorded straight off the back of the band’s three incredible EPs released throughout 2021. They were recorded straight off the back of 2020’s acclaimed album, ACR LOCO, their first new recording for Mute, and the remix album Loco Remezclada that followed saw them working with Speedy Wunderground’s Dan Carey, Manchester’s finest Lonelady, BBC Radio 1 regular Skream and old friends Sink Ya Teeth, amongst others. In 2023, ACR released their eleventh studio album 1982. Even by the band’s own standards, however, their latest studio album 1982 is multidimensional. It shoots off in every direction, whether via searing Afrobeat, mind-melting jazz breakdowns or moody electronic experiments. Featuring the singles ‘Holy Smoke’, Waiting on a Train’ and the BBC 6 Music playlisted tracks ‘SAMO’ and ‘Afro Dizzy’, the album was recorded by the core ACR line up of Jez Kerr, Martin Moscrop and Donald Johnson, alongside Tony Quigley, Matthew Steele and one of Manchester’s fastest-rising musicians, Ellen Beth Abdi: the band’s pleasure at being together in the studio is audible. ==In film== "Wild Party" was used in the soundtrack of the 1985 film Letter to Brezhnev. "Shack Up" was used in the soundtrack of Patrice Chéreau's Intimacy (2001). The band are featured in the 2002 film 24 Hour Party People where Tony Wilson (played by Steve Coogan) describes them as "having all the energy of Joy Division but better clothes". Martin Moscrop was musical supervisor of the film.Anson, John (2018) "Hacienda favourites A Certain Ratio to play date at Clitheroe Grand", Lancashire Telegraph, 21 November 2018.

175693	A Certain Sacrifice	A Certain Sacrifice is a 1985 American drama film co-written and directed by Stephen Jon Lewicki and starring Madonna, Jeremy Pattnosh and Charles Kurtz. It was Madonna's first movie, filmed from September 1979 through June 1981, but not released until 1985. A Certain Sacrifice is an independent-underground art film, shot on-and-off over two years in New York City on a low-budget of just $20,000. Madonna finished her scenes in late 1980. According to some estimations, the video release sold 50,000 copies in its first week, and the film achieved a certain cult status among some of her fans and collectors by that time. == Plot == Madonna plays the part of Bruna, a Lower East Side resident who lives with three "love slaves" (one woman, one man, and one trans woman). Bruna meets Dashiell (Pattnosh) in the water fountain in Washington Square Park and the two "fall in love". Bruna later tells her lovers she does not need them anymore, resulting in them attacking her sexually. Later, Bruna is raped by Raymond Hall (Kurtz) in a bathroom at a coffee shop. To exact retribution, Bruna enlists her love slaves and Dashiell to abduct the rapist. They dress up as prostitutes and lure him into a limousine. They lead him to a theatre where a Satanic sacrifice is performed. Dashiell later wipes Raymond's blood all over Bruna. == Production and development == A Certain Sacrifice is a Super 8 film. It was made on a low-budget between $12,000 to $20,000. The film marks the acting debut of Madonna and the directorial debut of Stephen Jon Lewicki, an aspiring filmmaker. Various authors have regarded the movie as an underground art film. Despite Madonna's second thoughts about having participated in this movie, Lewicki had nothing but compliments for her. One of his oft-repeated stories was how he "discovered" Madonna and was amazed that she hand-wrote a three-page letter for a part that did not even pay. She was only paid $100, only because she was short on her apartment rent and Lewicki paid to help out. In Christopher Andersen's 1991 biography, Madonna Unauthorized, Lewicki stated: "That woman has more sensuality in her ear than most women have anywhere on their bodies". Actor Jeremy Pattnosh wrote and performed several songs in the film, including: "Certain Sacrifice" and "Screamin' Demon Lover". Years later, in a 2000 Channel 4 documentary on Madonna's early years (titled Madonna: Naked Ambition), her Breakfast Club bandmate Dan Gilroy recalled: "I did not like that fellow who made A Certain Sacrifice, I felt he was using them big-time [...] it needed a laugh-track, something". == Release == In 1985, A Certain Sacrifice was released on video to capitalize on Madonna's fame, and in 1986, there were theatrical midnight screenings. Madonna tried to buy the rights from director Stephen Jon Lewicki, offering him $5,000 which later upped to $10,000. Unsuccessful, she then attempted to ban the film from being seen. Stephen Lewicki invited her to view it; Madonna was reportedly unhappy with the result. According to Lewicki, she had an expression of horror on her face and screamed "Fuck you" as she stormed out of his apartment. The release caused controversy in the press at the time, due to its sexually explicit and violent content, obtaining an R rating. Writing for The Wall Street Journal, Julie Salamon expressed: [...] Kind of a long MTV video with thinly developed themes of sadomasochism and ritual violence". ===Sales=== Edited in a one-inch video to further visually obscure it, the video release of A Certain Sacrifice sold more than 50,000 copies in its first week. According to biographer Andy Koopmans, in Madonna (2003), critics said that Madonna's appearance in the film was the only reason it sold well, while Mark Bego commented it was purchased by hard-core Madonna devotees alone. According to Billboard in 1985, Virgin Video, a joint venture of two independent distributors, had plans to distribute over one million copies of the video release by the end of 1985. In 2020, Nick Levine from The Daily Telegraph explained that Taraborrelli claims the film made Lewicki a "millionaire" in 1985. Lewicki once claimed that he deserved the financial success that came afterward, because he had taken a risk by casting an unknown Madonna, and the money he put into the movie. Despite most viewers labeled the film a failure, it also garnered cult status among some of Madonna's audience and collectors by that time of release. == References == == Book sources == * * * * * * * * == External links == * * Category:1985 films Category:1985 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American independent films Category:Films shot in New York City Category:American rape and revenge films Category:Films about Satanism Category:Teensploitation Category:1980s English- language films Category:1980s American films

37729193	A Certain Slant of Light (novel)	A Certain Slant of Light is a 2005 young adult horror novel by author Laura Whitcomb. The book was first published on September 21, 2005 by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt's Graphia imprint. Film rights for A Certain Slant of Light have been optioned by Summit Entertainment. The title is derived from the first line of "There's a certain Slant of light", a poem by Emily Dickinson. ==Synopsis== The book follows Helen, the ghost of a 27-year-old woman that has been dead for 130 years. The beginning of the story follows her through her life as a ghost, playing the role of invisible muse to a handful of artistically inclined people, lest she be cast back into her own personal hell. It's during her stay with English teacher Mr. Brown that Helen realizes that a student named Billy is aware of her presence. She later realizes that a spirit named James is inhabiting Billy's body after Billy overdosed on drugs. With the two being the only known beings of their type, James and Helen are quickly drawn to each other but are faced with the difficulties of residing within the bodies of other people. ==Characters== * Jenny: Jenny is a teenage girl under the strict rule of her religious parents. She has given up trying to reason with them and any attempts to have any feelings or life of her own. She, like Billy, has lost hope, and her emptiness makes her the perfect vessel for Helen. * Helen: Helen is a young woman who died many years ago. She remembers pieces of her old life, bits about a child who seems to be important to her, and she also remembers an intense fear of water. When Helen meets James they begin to fall in love. James helps her remember her past by finding Jenny. Helen then uses her body as a vessel. Now that James and Helen are in real bodies again they can be together, but this comes at a cost. They quickly realize that there are consequences for their actions and that they must undo the wrong they've done. * Billy: Teenager Billy has lost complete hope in ever having a normal life. High on drugs most of the time, he tries desperately to forget the night his father attacked his mother. The overwhelming emptiness he feels finally consumes him and he attempts suicide. His soulless body now becomes the perfect vessel for James, a young man killed during World War I. * James: A young man killed during World War I after witnessing his friend's death during combat now resides in this world as light trapped on this plane for the guilt he feels over his friend's death. He has now found his vessel Billy, and through Billy he has found Helen. ==Reception== Critical reception for A Certain Slant of Light has been predominantly positive, with the ALA making it one of their book picks for 2006.

2393925	A Certain Smile	A Certain Smile was originally published in French as Un certain sourire by the Paris publisher Juillard in 1956.World Cat It was the second novel by Françoise Sagan and was written in two months. Two translations into English then followed in 1956. That by Anne Green was published by E.P. Dutton in New YorkWorld Cat and that by Irene Ash was published by John Murray in London,World Cat followed in the same year by a Penguin Books paperback edition.Goodreads bibliography The story is related by a Parisian student who has an experimental love affair with a much older man. ==Plot== Dominique is a sophisticated twenty-year-old law student at the Sorbonne in mid-1950s Paris who is introduced by her lover Bertrand to his uncle and aunt, the worldly businessman Luc and his wife Françoise. Both Luc and Dominique are aware of their mutual attraction from the beginning, but Dominique holds off for fear of hurting both Bertrand and Françoise. The latter has become close to Dominique, relating to her almost as a mother, buying her presents and using the familiar form tu with her. Tiring of Bertrand, Dominique eventually decides on the experiment of accepting Luc's desire to make love to her and spends two weeks with him in a luxurious hotel in Cannes. Though she had promised herself not to fall in love with Luc, after their sexual separation and return to Paris, Dominique becomes obsessed with the memory of their past happiness and appeals to Luc not to end the affair. But for Luc their relationship had simply been a pleasant adventure and he can only pity Dominique's inexperience. Meanwhile Catherine, a fellow student, has told Bertrand of Dominique's affair and he informs Dominique that he is not prepared to share her affections. Then Pierre, a family friend who had caught sight of Luc and Dominique together in Cannes, tells Françoise about it out of jealousy, breaking up their friendship. But after some months of misery, while Luc is away in the US on business, Dominique is reconciled with Françoise and accepts the transience of her sexual relationship. "But what of it?" she concludes, "I was a woman, I had loved a man. It was a simple story; there was nothing to make a fuss about." For the future she has the accepting friendship of Alain, another student she has met recently, who is more her intellectual equal. ==Background== Sagan's novella reflects its author and the time when it was written. It is "studiedly young"Kirkus Review, 1 Aug., 1956 and makes its appeal to a young readership under the thrall of the contemporary climate of existentialism (to which reference is made in the course of the story) and its moral ambivalence.Abe Books description Another study notes that the novel's appearance was followed by the even greater challenge to conventional morality in the film Et Dieu Crea La Femme, embodied in its star Brigitte Bardot. The book's amoral stance is that of the well-off middle class to which its author belonged, as conveyed through her deceptively simple narrative style.Sophie Bober, "Lisez "Un certain sourire" pour vous nicher dans l'indolence provocatrice de Françoise Sagan", France Culture, 8 April, 2020 Thus it appeared in French intellectual terms, while the review in Time stated less sympathetically that "Sagan's prose is as disciplined as her characters are not… her novel is a petition in spiritual and emotional bankruptcy."Time, 20 August 1956, quoted at The Complete Review ==Interpretations== The novel's style was satirised by Jean Kerr in Harper's Bazaar in a 1956 parody titled "Toujours Tristesse". The short piece takes its beginning "After reading A Certain Smile by Françoise Sagan" and makes fun of the book's mood of melancholy boredom and amorality. The parody also later appeared in Ms Kerr's collection of essays, Please Don't Eat the Daisies.Please Don’t Eat the Daisies, Google Books, Open Road Media 2019 In 1958 there was a US film adaptation of Sagan's novel but it was only allowed to be made after substantial changes to the story. Sagan disapproved of it publicly and even its director Jean Negulesco has admitted that there is "not much of Sagan" in the film.Michelangelo Capua, Jean Negulesco: The Life and Films, McFarland 2017, p.107 ==References== Category:1956 French novels Category:E.

5508588	A Certain Woman	is the English translation of the name a Japanese novel by Arishima Takeo published in 1919. The first half of the novel first appeared in serialized form in the literary magazine Shirakaba , starting from January 1911 and running for 16 episodes to March 1913. The second half of the novel was not published until 1919, when both volumes were issued as a set. The novel is partly biographical, with Arishima modeling the protagonist, Yōko, after Kunikida Doppo's ex-wife, Nobuko Sasaki. The main theme of the novel is the changing place of women in Japanese society at the end of the Meiji period and Taishō period. ==Plot== left|thumb|120px|Sasaki Nobuko (20 July 1878 – 22 September 1949), the model for Yōko Satsuki. Yōko Satsuki, oldest of three sisters raised by a "progressive" mother at the start of the twentieth century, is strong-willed but capricious. She falls in love with a journalist (Kibe), and marries him in a "love match", when arranged marriages were still the norm. However, Yōko is very quickly bored with the journalist, and suddenly decides to divorce him and return to her parents' house. The journalist is devastated by the brief marriage and divorce, but Yōko feels only contempt for him, and (in the opening of the story), when she sees him on a train, she completely ignores his existence. After her parents' death, and following pressure from her relatives and friends, Yōko agrees to marry a friend of a friend (Kimura) who has settled in Chicago in the United States. However, on the steamer from Yokohama, Yōko has an affair with a married purser (Kuraji), oblivious to the disapproving eyes of the other passengers. By the time she reaches the United States, Yōko decides not to marry Kimura. After taking money from the hapless Kimura, Yōko returns to Japan together with Kuraji. Yōko and Kuraji start living together, despite the fact that Kuraji remains married to someone else, and Yōko has to look after her younger sisters. However, Yōko fails to find happiness, as she struggles financially and bickers constantly with Kuraji. Kuraji proves unreliable, and eventually disappears with a police arrest warrant over his head. The novel ends on a dark note; first Yōko's younger sister falls ill and dies, and then Yōko dies as well, worn out by her constant struggle to escape conventional society and morality. Although she only wanted to live her life as an individual not bound by the constrictions imposed by others, Japan at the start of the twentieth century was not the right place or time for such freedom. ==Film, TV and other adaptations== A Certain Woman was made into a movie by Shochiku Studios in October 1942, directed by Minoru Shibuya, and starring Kinuyo Tanaka in the role of Yōko (who is named Oshige in the film version). The cinematic version of A Certain Woman was re-issued by Daiei on March 13, 1954. Directed by Shirō Toyoda and starring Machiko Kyō in the role of Yōko, Masayuki Mori, who was the son of the author Arishima Takeo, played the role of the journalist, and Eiji Funakoshi played the role of Kimura. A Certain Woman has also been adapted for television twice. The first time was a mini-series by Nippon Television which ran from February 2, 1962, to March 9, 1962, and the second time was on Fuji Television, which ran from November 2, 1964, to November 30, 1964. ==International titles== *A Certain Woman, transl. by Kenneth Strong, University of Tokyo Press, 1978, 382 pages, . *Жінка ('The Woman'), transl. by Ivan Chyrko, Dnipro Publishing, 1978.

24577817	A Certain Young Man	A Certain Young Man is a 1928 comedy film directed by Hobart Henley. The film stars Ramon Novarro, Marceline Day, Renée Adorée, Carmel Myers and Bert Roach. The film is considered lost.A Certain Young Man at silentera.com databaseListing of incomplete MGM films at Nitrateville A trailer for the film is preserved at the Library of Congress. ==Synopsis== An English lord is overly fond of married women. ==Cast== * Ramon Novarro as Lord Gerald Brinsley * Marceline Day as Phyllis * Renée Adorée as Henriette * Carmel Myers as Mrs. Crutchley * Bert Roach as Mr. Crutchley * Huntley Gordon as Mr. Hammond * Ernest Wood as Hubert ==Production== The film was shot in 1926, but was not released until 1928. Sally O'Neil was originally cast as Phyllis but was replaced by Marceline Day. Joan Crawford, still an ingenue at the time, was considered for that same role, but she was deemed "unsuitable". Castmember Willard Louis died a few months after filming wrapped, and his name was removed from the credits.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018754/trivia ==Release== A Certain Young Man opened to reviews that were lukewarm at best, and was a financial failure at the box office. Some screenings were preceded by the Technicolor short The Czarina's Secret featuring Sally Rand and Olga Baclanova. The film's release followed on the heels of A Gentleman of Paris with Adolph Menjou, which was based on the same source material and was considered a better adaptation. Novarro's performance was unfavorably compared with that of Menjou by several critics,Soares, André; Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramon Novarro; St. Martin's Press, New York, 2002; p. 132-133 including Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times, who found the overall film "only mildly amusing and very shallow," though he found Myers "charming" and work by supporting actors Huntley Gordon and Bert Roach "favorable." Personally, Novarro hated the film and his performance. In an interview in the April 1931 issue of Modern Screen, he said "In acting, in directing, in everything — I want to be 'definite'. Even when I am later proven wrong — it will at least have been so definite that I myself know it. I am responsible for the worst performance that has ever been given on the screen. It was in A Certain Young Man and it was terrible. I am mortally ashamed of it — yet I'd rather have been bad than just fair."Soares, André, Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramon Novarro (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2002) p. 133 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1928 comedy films Category:1928 films Category:Films directed by Hobart Henley Category:Lost American films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:American silent feature films Category:Films based on British novels Category:American black-and-white films Category:Silent American comedy films Category:1928 lost films Category:Lost comedy films Category:1920s American films
55546946	A Chain of Thunder	A Chain of Thunder is the second volume in a 4-book series by Jeff Shaara, the set in the Western Theater of the American Civil War. This volume covers Ulysses Grant's campaign against Confederate General John Pemberton, leading to the South's crushing loss of the citadel of Vicksburg. ==Plot== As the war in the West turns badly for the South, the Union generals and their political commanders in Washington know that the one great barrier to Union control of the Mississippi River lies at the Confederate bastion of Vicksburg, Mississippi. Protected by high embankments, and a formidable presence of Confederate artillery, the Confederate forces there, under the command of John Pemberton, are confident that Vicksburg is a citadel that cannot fall. But Federal commander Ulysses Grant believes otherwise. Encouraged by his superiors in Washington to do whatever it takes, Grant launches an overland campaign that avoids a direct frontal assault on the town from the river, and instead, maneuvers his army downstream, crossing from Louisiana into Mississippi where the Confederates are too weak to make an effective stand. Instead of pushing directly at Vicksburg, Grant employs an audacious strategy, slicing quickly through the Mississippi countryside toward the capital city of Jackson. Pemberton's army cannot match Grant's unpredictable moves, and the Southern forces begin to understand that their commander is no match for the ingenuity Grant brings to the campaign. Though Pemberton's superior, General Joseph Johnston arrives in Jackson, Johnston sees Pemberton's situation as hopeless, and thus, holds his own forces back from the fight, allowing Grant the freedom to focus all his energies on Vicksburg itself. Johnston's reluctance to engage Grant, and thus offer relief to Vicksburg, is one of the most controversial decisions of the war. In May, 1863 Grant turns his enormous army toward Vicksburg, and discovers that Pemberton has not been idle. The city is protected by nine miles of entrenchments and earthworks, extending in an arc, each end anchored on the Mississippi River. After attempting two disastrous frontal assaults, Grant reluctantly accepts that the only effective way to capture the city is to besiege it. Thus, the Federal forces wrap Vicksburg in a tightening noose that Pemberton cannot hope to break through. After forty seven days, the Confederate troops, and the beleaguered civilians in the town endure hardships and privations none could have predicted, until, finally, Pemberton must accept the inevitable. It is a decision that will cause controversy for decades after, since the Confederate commander is in fact a Northerner himself, having joined the Southern cause from his home state of Pennsylvania. Many of his own troops regard Pemberton's actions as little more than treachery. The story is told primarily through the voices of Union General William T. Sherman, and, returning from the first volume (A Blaze of Glory), the young private from Wisconsin, Fritz Bauer. On the Southern side, the story is told through the eyes of Pemberton himself, as well as a young civilian woman in the town, Lucy Spence, who serves her cause the only way she can, by volunteering for nursing duties in the makeshift hospitals, enduring the kind of horror even the doctors are not prepared for. ==References== ==External links== * Jeff Shaara's Official Site Category:2013 American novels Category:Novels set during the American Civil War Category:Novels by Jeffrey Shaara Category:Ballantine Books books

62044041	A Chair for My Mother	A Chair for My Mother is a 1982 Caldecott Honor book by Vera B. Williams. According to the book's inscription, it was written in memory of the author's mother, Rebecca Poringer Baker. In January of 2007, a 25th anniversary edition of the book was released. ==Synopsis== A Chair for My Mother is told from the first-person point of view of a young girl who watches her mother work hard to bring home money, specifically tips to put into a large jar. The little girl says that they are saving up the coins for a new chair, because their old furniture had burned up in a fire at their old house. She tells the events of the fire and how she, her mother, and her grandmother had to go stay with her aunt and uncle. Her aunt and uncle then moved downstairs, so the girl's mother was left to fill the apartment. Everyone in the neighborhood pitched in to help them decorate their new place bringing a rug, new curtains, a kitchen table and more. The story returns to present day, a year after the fire. The jar is now full, so they count up all the change and put them in rolls. They tried many different chairs until they found the perfect one, red with pink flowers on it. The story wraps up with the girl, her mother, and her grandmother spending time together enjoying their new chair. ==References== Category:1982 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Caldecott Honor-winning works
8270511	A Chairy Tale	A Chairy Tale () is a 1957 Canadian stop-motion pixilation short film co- directed by Norman McLaren and Claude Jutra for the National Film Board of Canada. Set to the music of Ravi Shankar and Chatur Lal, it humorously portrays Jutra's attempts to sit on an uncooperative chair. == Synopsis == The film begins with a seemingly normal chair onscreen. Jutra enters, carrying a book, and attempts to sit on the chair so he can read his book. The chair unexpectedly moves out from under him. The man's persistent become increasingly frenetic and violent to himself. Finally, the man realises that perhaps the chair will let him sit on it if he allows the chair to sit on him first. This gambit succeeds, resulting the man sits on the chair at the end. == Filming == The film took place on one indoor scene such as an empty stage and dark curtains in the background. The animated chair method involved using the traditional string-puppet technique with the exception of attaching the string horizontally off-screen on the right side and on the left side with the help of two animators. The strings were invisible to the camera because they were fine black nylon fishing string. The film had variables speed of frames per second (fps) whether it was 16, 12, 8, 4 or 1 fps. In order to control the chair movement and the man action at a normal speed, the camera should capture the chair at half speed, 12 frames per second, and the man at 1/2 speed. However, if the chair action was difficult to control, the camera would have to capture it at 6 fps which end up the chair moving at 1/4 speed. If the camera had to capture the chair movement at a high speed and the man at a normal speed, it would have to record the chair at 8 fps and the man at 1/3 speed. In order to maintain a balance between the camera and the man or the chair action, the result was to slow them down at the same amount of speed. == Music == The background music of the film was accompanied with Indian music by Ravi Shankar, the sitar player, and Chatur Lau, the tabla player. The two musicians were invited to view the film after they had arrived in Montreal for a television recital. They were intrigued, and decided to compose music for the film. Since the film was already edited, McLaren split the film into two about ten loops and recorded the music into each of these loops. He added 20 seconds of silence in the loop for synchronizing the music and the performance. == Analysis == One interpretation of the film is that cooperation is a better option to resolve disputes rather than force. If one side of the party is willing to use violence and aggression in order to achieve their path, the result will end poorly. The lesson is to listen and to see the other party's point of view in order to solve the situation. Another interpretation of the film is that it is a coded queer narrative regarding the tension between 'topping' and 'bottoming,' where the chair refuses to bottom for the top (the man) until it has an opportunity to top. Once this is realised, and assented to, the chair willingly returns to its expectations. The romantic body language shared between the chair and the man support this view. == Accolades == Year Award Category Recipient(s) and Nominee(s) Result 1957 Venice Film Festival Non-Theatrical Arts and Experimental Norman McLaren and Claude Jutra 1957 Rapallo International Film Festival Second Prize, Experimental Norman McLaren and Claude Jutra 1958 British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) Special Award: Work Lying Outside The Feature and Documentary Fields A Chairy Tale 1958 10th Canadian Film Awards Award of Merit, Non-theatrical, Arts and Experimental Norman McLaren, Claude Jutra 1958 30th Academy Awards Live Action Film Norman McLaren ==Title== The title is a pun on the term "fairy tale" (using a portmanteau of "chair" and "fairy"), which is further emphasized by the use of the cliché fairy tale opening phrase "Once upon a time..." at the start of the film. It may also play on the word chary, a British adjective seldom encountered in American English.

35267660	A Challenge for Robin Hood	A Challenge for Robin Hood is a 1967 British adventure film directed by C. M. Pennington-Richards and starring Barrie Ingham, Peter Blythe and John Arnatt. ==Plot== When the father of the De Courtenay family dies, the brothers argue about the inheritance. Although rightfully most should go to Robin, his cousin Roger takes control after killing his brother and blaming Robin, and Robin has to go into hiding in the forest, taking Friar Tuck with him. The two come under attack from the Sheriff of Nottingham's soldiers but are saved by a mystery archer. This is Alan-a-Dale, who takes them to his forest hide-out. The gang test his archery skills with a hood over his head, and agree he is a natural leader. They decide to call him Robin Hood. Back in the De Courtenay castle, Roger sits with the Sheriff and Maid Marion and they watch a wrestling match. It is won by Little John. They plan to hang Will Scarlet, Robin's friend, who was captured at the time of Robin's escape, at the village fair. Robin stops Sir Jamyl de Penitone in the forest and challenges him to a sword duel. He learns of Will Scarlet's pending hanging. Robin robs him of the tax money he has collected. Robin and his men next stop a drayman and a pie seller traveling with him. They commandeer the cart-load of pies and Tuck disguises himself as the pie-seller, while Robin disguises himself as a monk. They go to the De Courteney fair, where they buy a lot of green cloth to better hide in the woods. A soldier recognises Robin but is sympathetic to his cause. Robin puts on a mask and volunteers for the prize wrestling match with Little John. John recognises him and they stage the fight so Robin wins. When he goes to collect his prize he grabs Marion and puts her on a horse for the loyal soldier to carry her off. He is arrested and is to be hung with Will Scarlet, but a pie fight begins and the soldiers are driven back. Little John goes back to the forest with them. In the forest the men take revenge on the tax collector and start returning the tax money to the peasants. The Sheriff's men trick Robin and his men into thinking the forest is on fire and while they investigate they kidnap Marion and her little brother, and kill Much, who was guarding them. Robin tries to rescue them but is captured too. Three of Robin's men (led by Little John) put fake ducks on their head and swim over the castle moat, despite a guard who fancies duck for dinner, and fires a crossbow at them. The three enter via an iron yett at basement level. They take a dumb waiter from the kitchen to the great hall, announcing that a "special dish" is coming up. They release Robin who was roasting in front of the fire and let other men in. A fight begins with the soldiers. Roger and Robin end in a sword duel watched by Marion. Alan-a-Dale ends it with an arrow in Roger's back. Back in the forest Friar Tuck marries Robin and Marion. ==Cast== * Barrie Ingham as Robin de Courtenay, alias Robin Hood * Peter Blythe as Sir Roger de Courtenay * John Arnatt as the Sheriff of Nottingham * Gay Hamilton as Lady Marian Fitzwarren * John Gugolka as Stephen Fitzwarren, the boy * James Hayter as Friar Tuck * Eric Flynn as Alan-a-Dale * Reg Lye as Much * Leon Greene as Little John * Douglas Mitchell as Will Scarlett * Eric Woofe as Henry de Courtenay * John Harvey as Wallace, Sir Roger's chief henchman * Arthur Hewlett as Edwin, the castle steward * John Graham as Justin, a loyal guard * Jenny Till as The Imposter Lady Marian * William Squire as Sir John de Courtenay * Norman Mitchell as Dray Driver * Alfie Bass as The Pie Seller * Donald Pickering as Sir Jamyl de Penitone ==Critical reception== The New York Times wrote, "Challenge for Robin Hood is excellent...it should make ideal viewing for lads, from little sprouts up to about 14...The screenplay by Peter Bryan fiddles a bit with the old Robin Hood legend, but it is a snug story and the dialogue has bite and humor...C. M.

7626588	A Challenge to Democracy	A Challenge to Democracy is a 20-minute short film produced in 1944 by the War Relocation Authority. The film could be considered a companion piece or sequel to 1942's Japanese Relocation. This film is more sober in its description. The film makes it clear that the Japanese Americans were forced from their circumstances, and that they were made to live in a rather barren relocation camp, which was surrounded by armed guards. The film states bluntly that the medicine available at the camp was the same as that of everybody else in war time—barely adequate. More positive features of camp life are also shown, whatever their historical accuracy may be: it shows the internees organizing a self-government, schools, and places of worship, as well as contributing to the war effort through industry. It also shows that some families were allowed to leave the camp if they were considered to be loyal enough. == See also == * List of Allied propaganda films of World War II ==External links== * * Category:1944 films Category:American World War II propaganda shorts Category:Documentary films about the internment of Japanese Americans Category:Articles containing video clips Category:American black-and-white films Category:American short documentary films Category:1944 documentary films Category:1940s American films Category:1940s English-language films Category:1940s short documentary films
18178263	A Championship	The A Championship, also known as the Newstalk A Championship, was an association football league featuring League of Ireland reserve teams and emerging senior teams. It was a third level league in the Republic of Ireland football league system. It was formed in 2008 and disbanded following the 2011 season. Between 2009 and 2011 the league was sponsored by Newstalk. It was effectively absorbed into the League of Ireland U19 Division. ==History== The idea of forming a regionalised A Championship was first proposed in 2006 as part of plan to reorganise the League of Ireland as a four tier structure. The A Championship eventually kicked off in 2008 and UCD A became the inaugural champions. Despite not defending their title in 2009, UCD subsequently went on to become the A Championship's most successful team. They were champions again in 2010 and then runners-up in 2011. Two other reserve teams, Shamrock Rovers A and Derry City A finished as champions in 2009 and 2011 respectively. When the A Championship was founded in 2008, thirteen of the sixteen inaugural members were the reserve teams of League of Ireland clubs. The other three teams were Mervue United, Salthill Devon and Tullamore Town. Sporting Fingal were also expected to join the A Championship for the 2008 season. However, when Kilkenny City withdrew from the First Division shortly before the season was due to start, Sporting Fingal were drafted in to replace them. The 2009 season featured six non-reserve teams. After Mervue United gained promotion to the First Division, Salthill Devon and Tullamore Town were joined by Cobh Ramblers, Castlebar Celtic, F.C. Carlow and Tralee Dynamos. The latter three were all making their debut at senior national level. They were also the first clubs from their respective counties of Mayo, Carlow and Kerry to play at this level. Castlebar Celtic and Tullamore Town both withdraw following the conclusion of the 2010 season but among their replacements were Fanad United. The non-reserve teams also represented the A Championship in the League of Ireland Cup and the FAI Cup. In 2009 at the League of Ireland clubs' annual convention, Dundalk called for the A Championship to be scrapped, arguing that it was putting an unwelcome financial burden on participating clubs. At the same convention Waterford United proposed that it should be optional rather than compulsory for senior sides to field a reserve team in the league. Drogheda United raised concerns about the "unacceptable level" of refereeing. According to a report in the Irish Independent one club, short of two players for an away match, paid two locals to make up their team while a number of fixtures were postponed because clubs di not have enough players. Following the conclusion of the 2011 season, the A Championship was absorbed into the League of Ireland U19 Division. Cobh Ramblers and Tralee Dynamos both unsuccessfully applied to join the 2012 League of Ireland First Division. Ramblers did however join the First Division in 2013 and Dynamos, together with Fanad United, joined the U19 Division. In 2013 Shamrock Rovers entered their reserve team in the First Division. ==Format== The A Championship format saw the members of the league split into two groups, divided roughly into southern and northern groups. The two groups used a traditional round-robin format. In 2008, 2009 and 2010, the two group winners played off in a final. In 2011 the two group runners-up also qualified for the title play-off. A promotion and relegation system operated between the League of Ireland Premier Division, the League of Ireland First Division and the A Championship. Reserve teams were ineligible for promotion but the highest placed non-reserve teams qualified for a promotion/relegation play-off against a First Division team providing they finished in the top three of their group. Mervue United in 2008 and Salthill Devon in 2009 were both promoted to the First Division. In contrast Cobh Ramblers were relegated directly from the 2008 Premier Division to the 2009 A Championship after they failed to obtain a First Division license. ==List of finals== Season Winner Results Runners-up Venue 2008 UCD A 2–1 Bohemians A UCD Bowl 2009 Shamrock Rovers A 1–0 Salthill Devon Drom Soccer Park 2010 UCD A 2–1 Bohemians A UCD Bowl 2011 Derry City A 3–2 UCD A Brandywell Stadium ==Related competitions== ===A Championship Shield=== Season Winner Result Runner-up Venue 2008 Cork City A 3–2 Bohemians A Buckley Park ===A Championship Cup=== Season Winner Result Runner-up Venue 2010 Sporting Fingal A 3–2 Bohemians A Dalymount Park ==Teams== Team Home town/suburb Ground Seasons Bohemians A Phibsborough AUL Complex Dalymount Park 2008–11 Bray Wanderers A Bray Jackson Park 2008–11 F.C.

929265	A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure	A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure is the fourth studio album by American electronic music duo Matmos, released in 2001. The album consists primarily of samples of medical procedures, including plastic surgeries, liposuctions, hearing tests and bonesaws. The album maintains a sense of humour in contrast with the serious nature of the audio being sampled. The exception to the medical samples is the song "For Felix (And All the Rats)", a piece dedicated to their deceased pet rat Felix, performed entirely on his cage. The two members of Matmos, Drew Daniel and Martin Schmidt, both had doctors as parents, a fact that likely influenced them in the album's creation. The album is sometimes considered a concept album within the glitch or musique concrète genre. == Critical reception == At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure received an average score of 80 based on 13 reviews, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Heather Phares of AllMusic described the album as "seven remarkably accessible, melodic pieces of experimental techno." Simon Reynolds of Spin said, "Matmos have captured with discomforting vividness the sheer surrealism of the modern vanity industry, the medieval tortures people gladly endure in pursuit of physical perfection." In 2017, Pitchfork placed A Chance to Cut Is a Chance to Cure at number 19 on its list of "The 50 Best IDM Albums of All Time". == Track listing == == Personnel == Credits adapted from liner notes.

3033793	A Change Is Gonna Come	"A Change Is Gonna Come" is a song by American singer-songwriter Sam Cooke. It initially appeared on Cooke's album Ain't That Good News, released mid- February 1964 by RCA Victor; a slightly edited version of the recording was released as a single on December 22, 1964. Produced by Hugo & Luigi and arranged and conducted by René Hall, the song was the B-side to "Shake". The song was inspired by various events in Cooke's life, most prominently when he and his entourage were turned away from a whites-only motel in Louisiana. Cooke felt compelled to write a song that spoke to his struggle and of those around him, and that pertained to the Civil Rights Movement and African Americans. Though only a modest hit for Cooke in comparison with his previous singles, "A Change Is Gonna Come" is widely considered one of Cooke's greatest and most influential compositions and has been voted among the greatest songs ever released by various publications. In 2007, the song was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress, with the National Recording Registry deeming the song "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important."Cannady, S. 2007, Recordings by Historical Figures and Musical Legends Added To the 2006 National Recording Registry: Library of Congress Accepting Nominations for the 2007 Registry, viewed May 9, 2017 In 2021, it appeared on Rolling Stone's list of the Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, ranked at No. 3. ==Background== On October 8, 1963, en route to Shreveport, Louisiana, Cooke called ahead to the Holiday Inn North to make reservations for his wife, Barbara, and himself, but when he and his group arrived, the desk clerk glanced nervously and explained there were no vacancies. While his brother Charles protested, Sam was furious, yelling to see the manager and refusing to leave until he received an answer. His wife nudged him, attempting to calm him down, telling him, "They'll kill you," to which he responded, "They ain't gonna kill me, because I'm Sam Cooke." When they eventually persuaded Cooke to leave, the group drove away calling out insults and blaring their horns. When they arrived at the Castle Motel on Sprague Street downtown, the police were waiting for them, arresting them for disturbing the peace. The New York Times ran a UPI report the next day, headlined "Negro Band Leader Held in Shreveport," but African-Americans were outraged. In 2019, then-Shreveport mayor Adrian Perkins apologized to Cooke's family for the event, and posthumously awarded Cooke the key to the city. In addition, upon hearing Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind" in 1963, Cooke was greatly moved that such a poignant song about racism in America could come from someone who was not black, and was also ashamed he had not yet written something like that himself. However, his image and fears of losing his large white fan base had prevented him from doing so. Cooke loved Dylan's song so much it was immediately incorporated into his repertoire. He was further influenced by the message of the dream in Martin Luther King Jr's I Have a Dream speech at the civil rights march on Washington that year. Toward the end of 1963, according to Cooke, the Change composition came to him in a dream. ==Recording and production== Following Christmas 1963, Cooke invited J.W. Alexander to his home to preview a new song he had just written, one Cooke was very excited about. When he arrived, Cooke ran through the number on his guitar twice, the second time going over it line by line. Both were very excited to record the song, with Alexander viewing it as more personal and political than anything he had yet attempted. He warned Cooke that he might not profit off the song as he had with lighter, poppier songs, but Cooke did not care. He explained to Alexander that he hoped the song would make his father proud. "It was less work than any song he'd ever written," biographer Peter Guralnick says. "It almost scared him that the song—it was almost as if the song were intended for somebody else. He grabbed it out of the air and it came to him whole, despite the fact that in many ways it's probably the most complex song that he wrote. It was both singular—in the sense that you started out, 'I was born by the river'—but it also told the story both of a generation and of a people." Cooke handed the song to his arranger René Hall, with no specific instructions as to what he personally wanted, but to give it “the kind of instrumentation and orchestration that it demanded.” Previously, the duo had collaborated on arrangement, but this was the first occasion in which Hall was granted complete control of the eventual arrangement, and he composed it as he would a movie score, with lush, symphonic strings. "I wanted it to be the greatest thing in my [life]—I spent a lot of time, put out a lot of ideas, and then changed them and rearranged them," said Hall. Cooke was well known as a perfectionist and "control freak" in the recording studio, so giving Hall total latitude was unprecedented. AFO drummer John Boudreaux was intimidated by the orchestral arrangement and refused to leave the control room; session player and close collaborator Earl Palmer was working next door and filled in for the song. Luigi Creatore asked Cooke to provide one more take, and the eighth take was "nearly perfect." Luigi was very pleased with the song, considering it among his best, both very serious and still uniquely his own. Cooke had initially imagined that Luigi, first and foremost a pop hitmaker, would not respect the socially conscious song. ==Composition== Each verse is a different movement, with the strings carrying the first, the horns the second, and the timpani carrying the bridge. The French horn present in the recording was intended to convey a sense of melancholy. Cooke incorporated his own personal experiences as well into the song, such as encounters in Memphis, Shreveport and Birmingham, to reflect the lives and struggles of all African- Americans of the time. The lines "I don't know what's up there / Beyond the sky" could refer to Cooke's doubt for absolute true justice on earth. The final verse, in which Cooke pleads for his "brother" to help him, is a metaphor for what Alexander described as "the establishment". The verse continues, 'But he winds up knocking me / back down on my knees.'" ==Personnel== "A Change Is Gonna Come" was recorded on January 30, 1964, at RCA Studios in Hollywood, California. The engineer present was Wally Heider, and the session was conducted and arranged by René Hall. The musicians also recorded "Falling in Love" the same day. Credits adapted from the liner notes to the 2003 compilation Portrait of a Legend: 1951–1964. *Sam Cooke – lead vocals *SR Crain – backing vocals *Paul Foster – backing vocals *Jimmie Outler – backing vocals *Richard Gibbs – backing vocals *JJ Farley – backing vocals *René Hall – guitar *Norman Bartold – guitar *Arnold Belnick – guitar *Clifton White – guitar *Chuck Badie – bass guitar *Earl Palmer – drums *Harold Battiste – piano *William Hinshaw – French horn *Emil Radocchia – marimba, timpani, percussion *William Kurasch – trumpet *Louis Blackburn – trombone *John Ewing – trombone *David Wells – trombone *Harry Hyams – viola *Alexander Neiman – viola *Israel Baker – violin *Irving Lipschultz – violin *Leonard Malarsky – violin *Jack Pepper – violin *Ralph Schaeffer – violin *Sidney Sharp – violin *Darrel Terwilliger – violin *Tibor Zelig – violin *Emmet Sargeant – cello ==Release== Cooke first performed "A Change Is Gonna Come" on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson on February 7, 1964. Cooke's new manager, Allen Klein, was infatuated with the song and persuaded Cooke to do away with promoting his most recent single, "Ain't That Good News", and perform "Change" instead, feeling that that was the statement he needed to make before a national audience. Cooke objected, noting that the album's release was a month away and that he had no time to pull together an arrangement within such a short time frame. Klein arranged for RCA to pay for a full string section and Cooke performed the song that Friday on The Tonight Show after performing "Basin Street". An NBC timekeeper logged down the number as "It's a Long Time Coming," but the network did not save the tape of the performance. Klein and Alexander both felt it would become a milestone moment in Cooke's career, but it was overshadowed by the Beatles' performance on The Ed Sullivan Show on CBS just two days later. The song was issued on March 1 as a track on Cooke's album Ain't That Good News. It would not be issued as a single for another nine months. Cooke elected not to perform "A Change Is Gonna Come" again in his lifetime, both because of the complexity of the arrangement and because of the ominous nature of the song. When shown to his protégé Bobby Womack, his response was that it sounds "like death." Cooke responded, "Man, that's kind of how it sounds like to me. That's why I'm never going to play it in public." Womack clarified his thoughts, that it wasn't deathly, but rather "spooky," but Cooke never performed the song again. In December, "A Change Is Gonna Come" was prepared for single release, with the verse and chorus preceding the bridge ("I go to the movies…") deleted for radio airplay. The civil rights movement picked up on "A Change Is Gonna Come" with near immediacy. On December 11, 1964, two weeks before the song was released, Sam Cooke was fatally shot at a Los Angeles motel. Cash Box described the single as "a moving, string-filled ‘message’ tune." == Legacy == "A Change Is Gonna Come" became an anthem for the Civil Rights Movement, and is widely considered one of Cooke's greatest compositions. Over the years, the song has garnered significant praise. In 2004, it was voted number 12 by representatives of the music industry and press in Rolling Stone magazine's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. It was then voted number 3 in Rolling Stone's 2021 edition of the list. The song was ranked number 3 in the webzine Pitchfork Media's The 200 Greatest Songs of the 60s. The song is also among 300 songs deemed the most important ever recorded by National Public Radio (NPR). Acclaimed Music ranked it as the 46th greatest song of all time, as well as the third best song of 1964. NPR called the song "one of the most important songs of the civil rights era." In 2007, the song was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress, with the National Recording Registry deeming the song "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important." The words “A change is gonna come” are on a wall of the Contemplative Court, a space for reflection in the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture; the museum opened in 2016. ===In other media=== Otis Redding covered the song for his 1965 album Otis Blue, saying he wanted to "fill the silent void" created by Cooke's death. His version, retitled "Change Gonna Come," is a more restrained arrangement without any orchestration. The 5th Dimension covered it on their 1970 album Portrait, in a medley with the United States Declaration of Independence and People Got to Be Free, and released a popular single of the three songs. Baby Huey covered it in a posthumous album released in 1971. The song served as a sample for rappers Ghostface Killah (1996), Ja Rule (2003), Papoose (2006), Lil Wayne (2007) "Long Time Coming (remix)" Charles Hamilton, Asher Roth, B.o.B (2009), Nas's It Was Written album also features a similar opening as the song, On their album The Reunion hip-hop artists Capone-N-Noreaga used an excerpt from the song on the opening track which shares the same title as the Cooke original, and Bizzle (2011). After winning the 2008 United States presidential election, Barack Obama referred to the song, stating to his supporters in Chicago, "It's been a long time coming, but tonight, change has come to America." A duet of the song by Bettye LaVette and Jon Bon Jovi was included in We Are One: The Obama Inaugural Celebration at the Lincoln Memorial. In Washington DC, in the days leading up to the Inauguration of Barack Obama, this song could be heard played constantly in the city centre. In 2004, Patti LaBelle performed the song on the annual Nobel Peace Prize Concert to a standing ovation. The West Wing season 6 episode 7 first aired on December 1, 2004. The episode was called "A Change Is Gonna Come" and featured a tribute to Sam Cooke, where James Taylor performed the song for President Bartlet and other guests at a reception. In 2010, Shinyribs performed the song on the Well After Awhile album. On June 1, 2013, Beyoncé Knowles sang the song during The Sound of Change Live concert in London, as part of Chime for Change, an organization which supports total equality between women and men in all areas of life. Mark Sutherland of Rolling Stone magazine noted that Knowles belted out the song, while Alice Vincent from The Daily Telegraph noted that the rendition of the song reflected the event's purpose. Later, on July 20, 2013, Knowles performed the song during a stop in Detroit as part of her Mrs. Carter Show World Tour. The performance followed the city's recent file for bankruptcy. As Knowles performed, the screen behind her displayed photos of Detroit's landmarks and icons including Aretha Franklin, Aaliyah, Eminem, Anita Baker, Bob Seger, Kid Rock, the White Stripes, Berry Gordy Jr., Joe Louis. The montage ended with the declaration "Nothing Stops Detroit!" and Knowles closed the performance by saying "I love you, Detroit". A spokesperson for the singer described the performance as a "unique tribute to the history of an incredible city and a celebration of the strong spirit of its people". A black-and-white video of the cover was uploaded on Knowles' official YouTube channel on July 30, 2013. It closes with a quote from Henry Ford: “Failure is simply the opportunity to start over, this time more intelligently." A reporter for The Huffington Post reported that the singer's "heartfelt" cover of the song "touched" her fans and the people who loved Detroit. Latifah Muhammad of the Black Entertainment Television wrote that Knowles' "powerful" rendition of the song came right on time. An editor for Essence described Knowles' cover as a "moving tribute to Detroit". Jordan Sargent of Spin wrote, "It all might come off as a bit heavy- handed if it wasn't for the fact that, well, Beyonce absolutely slays the cover." Lauren Moraski from CBS News described the tribute to the city as "touching". In 2017, Greta Van Fleet released a cover of the song on their double EP From the Fires.

28182107	A Change Is Gonna Come (Grey's Anatomy)	"A Change Is Gonna Come" is the fourth season premiere of the American television medical drama Grey's Anatomy, and the 62nd episode of the overall series. The premiere focused on the aftermath of the main characters' promotion to residency, following the conclusion of their internship. The episode was the first not to feature Isaiah Washington, portraying Preston Burke, due to his being fired from the series at the conclusion of season 3. The episode also marked Chyler Leigh's promotion to series regular status, following her guest appearances in the last 2 episodes of the previous season. Also featured were one-time guest actors Mark Pellegrino, Stephania Childers, Sandra Thigpen, and Steven Porter. The story arcs which provided a particular focus on individual characters include Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh) dealing with the aftermath of Burke's (Washington) departure, and the dissolution of their engagement, Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) struggling with her romantic feelings towards the married George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), and Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) learning to deal with her new position of Chief Resident. Also dealt with was Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) coping with Rebecca Pope's (Elizabeth Reaser) departure, and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) facing the conclusion of her relationship with Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), while dealing with the arrival of her half-sister, Lexie Grey (Leigh), who enrolls in the surgical program at the hospital. The script for the premiere was written by series creator Shonda Rhimes, while Rob Corn served as the director. The episode aired on September 27, 2007 in the United States on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC), with an approximated 20.93 million viewers tuning in. Ranking #2 in the time-slot and #3 for the week, the episode garnered a 7.3 Nielsen rating in the 18–49 demographic, seeing a decrease from the previous episode, which received an 8.0 rating. Critical response of the episode ranged from mixed to negative, with Yang's storyline being a particular source of critical acclaim from television reviewers. Although the episode was fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, filming occurred in Los Angeles, California. == Plot == The episode opens to a voice- over narrative from Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) about change, the episode's main theme. Following the conclusion of their internship, Meredith, along with her colleagues, Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) commence their residency in the department of surgery, and start dealing with new responsibilities, including the new generation of interns, to whom they have been assigned as mentors. After failing his post-internship exam in the season three finale, George O'Malley (T. R. Knight) must repeat his internship year, to avoid being forced to leave the medical field. It is revealed that Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), Meredith's half-sister, is one of the new interns. She previously had a flirtatious encounter at Joe's with Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), who was unaware of her identity. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), whom Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.) chose over Miranda Bailey's (Chandra Wilson) to be Chief Resident, finds difficulty in expressing authoritative behavior, receiving little respect from her subordinates. It is explained that, in the aftermath of her being left by Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) at the altar, Yang spent her honeymoon traveling with Meredith. Having just returned, she is shocked to learn that Burke has resigned from Seattle Grace, and relocated to an unknown location. She cried in response. Stevens has to deal with her romantic feelings for O'Malley, whose marriage to Torres is being threatened by his yet to be exposed affair. O'Malley, who finds himself in the unpleasant situation of repeating his internship, quickly gains support in Lexie, who decides not to tell the fellow interns about his failed exam. Karev is revealed to have visited Rebecca Pope (Elizabeth Reaser), following her departure. In the absence of Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), who relocated to Los Angeles, California, Mark Sloan (Eric Dane) seeks reconciliation with Shepherd, formerly his closest friend and confidant. Initially unwilling to resume his friendship with Sloan, Shepherd ultimately gives him a second chance. Bailey manifests a cold attitude towards Webber, in order to express her disappointment in not being given the position of Chief Resident, in spite of her enviable reputation among the hospital staff. Lexie meets Meredith for the first time, but is demoralized when she becomes aware of her apparent discomfort. Meredith and Shepherd encounter difficulty in being broken up, realizing that their mutual romantic feelings are an impediment in their attempt at having separate lives. The emergency room is filled with victims from a chain car accident, one of whom is admitted in the department of neurosurgery, under the care of Shepherd and Yang. As the physicians soon discover that he has been internally decapitated, they come to the conclusion that even a minor move would result in irreparable damage. A pregnant woman is admitted in plastic surgery, after having her arm severed. Meredith is assigned to work for Sloan during the day, and is immediately told to find the arm, much to the fascination of her interns. Despite trying to deal with her trainees in a strict manner, Stevens is looked upon as unprofessional by the interns she was assigned to. Her image is further deteriorated when she decides to abandon her hospital duties in order to perform surgery on a deer. Meredith and Shepherd discuss the repercussions of their breakup, and realize that they cannot reconcile. However, the two engage in sexual intercourse, as a manner to express their mutual feelings for the last time. O'Malley comes to the realization of his love for Stevens, and quickly discloses to her that he shares her romantic feelings. == Production == "A Change Is Gonna Come" was written by series creator and executive producer Shonda Rhimes, whereas filmmaker and series veteran Rob Corn served as the director. The soundtrack used in the episode included Mat Kearney's "Breathe In, Breathe Out", I'm from Barcelona's "Oversleeping", Meiko's "Reasons to Love You" and Cinematic Orchestra's "To Build A Home". Also featured in the episode was "Knock 'Em Out", the second track from British pop singer-songwriter Lily Allen's debut album, Alright, Still. Several one-time guest stars appeared in the episode, including Mark Pellegrino, who played Chris, Stephania Childers, portraying Nancy Walters, Sandra Thigpen in the role of Clara, and Steven Porter, who acted as Joey. Although fictionally set in Seattle, Washington, filming primarily occurred in Los Angeles, California. Scenes in the operating room were filmed at the Prospect Studios in Los Feliz, Los Angeles. The season 4 premiere saw Leigh's first appearance as a main cast member. Leigh first appeared on the show during the last 3 episodes of season 3 as Meredith's half-sister, Lexie. Following Washington's departure, it was reported that show's executives were planning on adding new cast members, such as Lexie. She was officially upgraded to a series' regular on July 11, 2007, for season 4. On casting Leigh as Lexie, Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes stated, "We met with a lot of young actresses, but Chyler stood out. She had a quality that felt right and real to me. It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting." Leigh offered her insight on her first days working with the main cast of the series, "It was like coming into somebody else's group or circle. It was a little daunting in the beginning. But I have had such a great time." Also introduced in "A Change Is Gonna Come" is the new generation of interns, all of whom were portrayed in co-star capacity, with the exception of Lexie. "A Change Is Gonna Come" was the first episode in 2 years not to feature the character of Montgomery, due to her portrayer, Walsh, leaving the series in order to launch the Grey's Anatomy spin-off, medical drama Private Practice. However, the character continued to be prominent throughout the run of the series, appearing sporadically as a guest-star in the following seasons. "A Change Is Gonna Come" was the first episode not to feature Washington's character, Burke. Washington was officially fired from the series, following an on-set incident with Knight and Dempsey, which had been in the media attention since the commencement of the production for the third season. News reports surfaced that Washington had insulted co-star Knight with a homophobic slur. Following the exposure of the argument, Knight publicly disclosed his homosexuality, which led to Washington's issuing an apology statement, regarding his inappropriate use of words during the incident. The controversy later resurfaced when the cast appeared at the 65th Golden Globe Awards ceremony, which saw Washington ridiculing homosexuality during an interview, following the statement that denied the occurrence of an on-set incident. After being rebuked by his studio, Touchstone Television, Washington publicly apologized at length for using the epithet in reference to Knight. An issue of People disclosed Washington's presence at executive counseling, which led to an undetermined hiatus of his contract. After "Didn't We Almost Have It All?", the last episode Washington appeared in, was filmed, the network decided not to give Washington the possibility of a renewal. In a statement released by his publicist, Washington assessed, "I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore". In another report, Washington stated he was planning to spend the summer pursuing charity work in Sierra Leone, while working on an independent film. In a subsequent interview, Washington highlighted the unfairness in his being let go from the series, considering filing a lawsuit as a result. He also accused Knight of using the controversy to bolster his own career and increase his salary on the series. Following his firing, Washington began asserting that racism within the broadcasting media was a primary factor in his dismissal from the series, which drew a critical perspective from Rhimes. During his appearance on Larry King Live, Washington once again denied using a homophobic epithet in reference to Knight."Interview transcript" July 2, 2007. Cable News Network. While writing the episode, Rhimes put an emphasis on the character of O'Malley, detailing his relationships with both Stevens and Torres. On the topic, Rhimes elaborated, "The interns are residents now, with interns of their own. Except for George, poor George, who is stuck repeating his intern year. It's not easy being a repeater. He's the only who hasn't gone through any change when we begin the episode. But by the end, he has. He tells Izzie that he loves her too. Which takes guts. Because he knows what he is getting into. He's a married man with a great wife, and he never intended to be a married man who loved another woman." Regarding Meredith's story arc, Rhimes felt that she cannot deal with all that is expected of her in her relationship with Shepherd, choosing their genuine love as the greatest obstacle in their decision to break up. Writing for Yang's storyline, Rhimes focused on her unsuccessful attempts at moving on, exposing her devastation at the realization of Burke's departure, which would be the main seasonal storyline for the character. The episode also deals with Sloan and Shepherd's path to reconciliation. Rhimes disclosed that the concept for the plot point was to have the two characters go back to being friends, as a result of Montgomery's departure. Rhimes offered her insight on Lexie's arrival, "Lexie Grey is here now. And she's here to stay. I love that she's a bit of a dork. Being a dork myself, I am fond of the girls with verbal diarrhea. Because it's not easy to keep all your words in, believe me." Regarding Webber and Bailey's storyline, Rhimes noted that the latter's intentions are not to let the former "off the hook" for choosing Torres over her for the position of Chief Resident, which was righteously hers. Rhimes highlighted the unfairness in Webber's choice, noting his unusual manner of comprehending the situation. "She's Bailey. She's worked hard, she's been the best. And isn't it just like the Chief to decide what is best for her? It's his flaw, the Chief. He's an old school man and like an old school man, he's taking care of his women. Whether they like it or not. This isn't gonna be an easy pill for Bailey to swallow." == Reception == "A Change Is Gonna Come" was originally broadcast in the United States on September 27, 2007, airing on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in its regular 9:00 Eastern time-slot. Viewed by a total of 20.93 million viewers, the episode is the series' second most-watched season premiere, just behind the third season opener, which had been watched live by 25.41 million American viewers. In comparison to the previous episode, which was watched by 22.57 million viewers, "A Change Is Gonna Come" made a 21% decrease in terms of viewership. However, the viewership of the episode ranked second in both its time-slot and the entire night, being beaten out by its airtime rival, CSI: Crime Scene Investigation on CBS, which was watched by 25.22 million viewers. In the entire week, the episode ranked third, being beaten out by both CSI and fellow ABC show Dancing With the Stars. In addition to being a success in viewership, the episode also did well in ratings. "A Change Is Gonna Come" garnered a 7.3 Nielsen rating in household viewership, ranking second in its time-slot, and third for the week. The premiere generally received mixed to negative feedback from television critics. Debbie Chang on BuddyTV deemed the episode "dysfunctional and ridiculous", being particularly critical of the story arc involving Stevens, whom she described as not being worthy of being promoted to the residency level. Chang expressed disagreement with the manner Bailey and Shepherd's characters were dealt with by the writers, feeling that the former's anger should have been targeted at herself, and criticizing the exaggerated exposure of the latter's "first grader emotional maturity". However, Yang's character was praised, with Chang choosing her manner of repressing her feelings as a highlight. Chang expressed a general disappointment in the episode, disapproving the choice for the episode as a season opener, a topic in regard to which she elaborated, "I can see already that this season will continue to bring us medical cases that are so blatantly about the doctors' pathetic lives." In September 2009, the inclusion of the deer ranked #12 in Entertainment Weekly "Most Memorable Cases of Grey's Anatomy". Eileen Lulevitch, entertainment reviewer for TV Guide, was generally favorable of the episode, writing, "Watching the season premiere tonight was like welcoming an old friend back into your home. It was so easy to slip back into Grey's world and get caught up in all of the amazing moments that make this show so much fun to watch. And while I expected the night to start off on a somber note, by addressing Burke and Cristina's fallout, I was pleasantly surprised by the way the attendees paid tribute to Bailey, by giving their new interns the same exact first-day speech Bailey had given them." Lulevitch praised Meredith's story-arc, noting the surprising turn her character evolution has taken, as she praised Lexie's introduction. While expressing a negative perspective on the writers' decision to have Torres be the Chief Resident, instead of Bailey, Lulevitch described Torres' adjustment to her new position as one of the episode's focal points. Despite praising Yang's storyline in the personal background, the concept of her interaction with the patient she was assigned to was regarded as predictable and obvious, "When the man's family came to see him, and Cristina told them it could be for the very last time. It was that moment that really got Cristina thinking about how much she did in fact miss Burke, as we later learned in the episode." Writing for IGN, Laura Burrows was favorable of the episode. Regarding the storylines developed in "A Change Is Gonna Come", Burrows elaborated, "The season opener was promising in that it had the interns in a new role and introduced a new side of George. As all of his friends progressed from interns to residents, George was forced to re-sit his internship. This created new drama and also opened up the hospital to a whole new set of interns rife with their own set of emotional baggage and drama. There were a series of interesting and new plots." Heigl, who portrayed Stevens, was particularly critical of her character's relationship with O'Malley, deeming it "a ratings ploy". Heigl further explained her outlook on the progression of her character, "They really hurt somebody, and they didn't seem to be taking a lot of responsibility for it. I have a really hard time with that kind of thing. I'm maybe a little too black and white about it. I don't really know Izzie very well right now." Former The Star-Ledger columnist Alan Sepinwall expressed a negative perspective on the episode, deeming it childish and ridiculous. He disliked Rhimes' conception of the story arc involving Stevens, elaborating, "If there's a doctor on this show who should be forced to repeat their intern year, if only to prevent them from being allowed to influence younger doctors, it's Izzie, not George. She proves her unfitness for this role with her first patient of the day, the deer. Not cute, not character- illuminating, just dumb." Also criticized was Torres, whose regression from a "cool, rocking, outgoing, confident and full-of-life" role was highlighted, receiving negative feedback from Sepinwall, who wrote "Now the character exists entirely so the writers can dump on her, in a devolution far worse than anything. I just don't get it, and it pains me to watch any scene with Callie in it. Despite expressing a negative outlook on Meredith's story-arc which dealt with Shepherd, noting that the "constant break-ups and reunions are as silly as if Shonda Rhimes had just kept them apart for 3 seasons before letting them kiss", Sepinwall was favorable of Lexie's arrival at Seattle Grace, feeling that "she's still being written as Meredith circa season 1 in an attempt to make us like her, but I didn't mind the manipulation, if only because there are so few characters left on this show to like." The Buzzsugar television reviewer was mainly critical of the episode, describing it as a departure from "the old show". However, Lexie's introduction was praised in the Buzzsugar review. == References == ==External links== * Category:2007 American television episodes Category:Grey's Anatomy (season 4) episodes

3926846	A Change Would Do You Good	"A Change Would Do You Good" is the fourth single from American singer- songwriter Sheryl Crow's 1996 self-titled album. The song uses a series of non sequitur lyrics to describe what one should change in life. It became Crow's third top-five single from the album in Canada, where it reached number two, and peaked at number eight in the United Kingdom. ==Background and lyrics== In an interview with Songfacts, guitarist Jeff Trott revealed "A Change Would Do You Good" was written in New Orleans during a six-month stay with co-writers Sheryl Crow and Brian MacLeod. The group decided to create a song by looking into classic soul music for inspiration, specifically by the Staple Singers and Mavis Staples. Eventually, the trio came up with so many lyric ideas that they resorted to drawing them out of a hat, putting together similar lines so they made sense. The lyrics of the song are mostly abstract, but they work together to highlight what one needs to change in life. Each verse also has a meaning. According to Trott, the first verse is about music producer Bill Bottrell, who left in the middle of the album's production, angering Crow. Trott admitted that even though the lyrics were derogatory, they were more playful than harsh. The second verse was inspired by Madonna—who had begun to tone down her sexual image during the song's conception—as well as a few other people who were not named. Crow decided to make the final verse about herself but had to convince Trott and MacLeod to do so. ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, "Sheryl Crow's current eponymous collection proves to be knee-deep in solid radio entries. The set's third single is yet another infectious toe-tapper that has the fun vibe of a freewheeling campfire sing- along-but with the kind of biting and intelligent lyrics that have elevated Crow miles above the current glut of guitar-slingin' women. There's no question that pop and mainstream rock programmers will be going out of the way to put this winner on the air ASAP." A reviewer from Music Week rated the song three out of five, stating that "Crow is in familiar country-lite territory". David Sinclair from The Times described it as a "typical mid-tempo chug delivered in her tough but sexy drawl".Sinclair, David (July 5, 1997). "The week's top pop releases; Records". The Times. ==Music videos== Several versions of a music video were shot. The first video, directed by Crow and Lance Acord, features Crow standing in the middle of Gay Street in New York City playing a guitar while a second Crow is throwing her possessions (and eventually herself) out of an apartment building window. This video appears on the DVD The Very Best of Sheryl Crow and was shot in black and white. The second video, directed by Michel Gondry, shows Crow similar to the character Samantha Stephens from the TV sitcom fantasy Bewitched. She switches around characters' lives, such as a cab driver and teen garage band singer. Notable guests include Mary Lynn Rajskub, Heather Matarazzo, Jeff Garlin, Ellen DeGeneres, Molly Shannon, Andy Dick and Toby Huss. This video appears on the DVD compilation Michel Gondry 2: More Videos (Before and After DVD 1). This video received negative reaction from critics due to too much dialogue during the song, and was "jeered" by TV Guide. The video was later re-edited with less dialogue. The final video is taken from a VH1 live performance. ==Live performances== Crow performed the song at President Obama's 2008 Inaugural Ball for the Midwest States.

7642020	A Change in Me	"A Change in Me" is a song written by composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice for the musical Beauty and the Beast, a stage adaptation of Disney's 1991 animated film of the same name. The song was written specifically for American singer Toni Braxton when she joined the production to play the role of Belle in 1998, four years into the musical's run. Menken and Rice wrote "A Change in Me" to appease Braxton after Rice promised the singer, who was hesitant to sign her contract, that he would write an entirely new song for her to perform in the musical on the condition that she finally agree to play Belle. Appearing during the show's second act, Belle sings "A Change in Me" to her father Maurice after reuniting with him to explain how much she has matured and changed for the better while she was imprisoned at the Beast's castle. Immediately popular among critics and audiences, the pop ballad has been positively received since Braxton debuted it, remaining part of the show's set list ever since. Actress Susan Egan, who originated the role of Belle in 1994, recorded the first studio version of "A Change in Me" in 2002 for her debut studio album So Far; her cover was the song's first English-language recording. == Background == Composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice had already written six original songs for the stage adaptation of Beauty and the Beast, most of which focus on character development, including a solo for Belle entitled "Home". In July 1998, American R&B; singer Toni Braxton entered final negotiations to make her Broadway debut as Belle in Beauty and the Beast, replacing actress Kim Huber in the role. Despite having initial reservations due to the singer's reputation as a sex symbol, director Robert Jess Roth eventually concluded that Braxton would offer an "interesting" interpretation of Belle after first meeting with her to discuss the role and observing similarities between Braxton's own personality and the character's. Once Roth forwarded his approval of the singer's casting to Disney, the studio began collaborating with Braxton's management on developing a contract stipulating that the singer would appear in the show for a three-month period. However, various circumstances resulted in Braxton continuously delaying to sign the contract until she met for dinner with Menken, Rice and choreographer Matt West; Roth was out of town at the time and unable to attend due to scheduling conflicts. A few days after their dinner, Braxton telephoned Ross to confirm that she had finally signed the contract; this was the first time Ross learned that Rice had apparently promised Braxton that he would write an entirely new song for her to sing in the musical if she agreed to sign the paperwork. Panicked, Ross immediately contacted Rice, who confirmed that he had in fact agreed to write a song for Braxton, blaming himself for having consumed too much alcohol during their dinner. Rice asked Ross to allow him 24 hours to review the musical and see if there was in fact a moment for which he and Menken could develop a new song, and decided to write a ballad for the second act during which Belle tells Maurice how she has changed during her stay in the Beast's castle. "A Change in Me" was written four years into Beauty and the Beasts run. In addition to being the first black performer to portray Belle on Broadway, Braxton was the first African-American woman to star in a leading role in a Disney production across any medium. ==Context and composition== "A Change in Me" is considered to be among the musical's original songs that both advance its storyline and provide character development; "A Change in Me" specifically allows Belle to further explore and elaborate on her newfound feelings for the Beast, adding dimension to their relationship. The song also further empowers Belle, expanding upon her dimension as a character. Appearing during the show's second act, the ballad is performed by Belle to indicate that her feelings towards the Beast have softened. Delivered simply, she explains to her father Maurice that she no longer longs for the things she had wished for earlier in Act 1's "Belle (Reprise)", revealing just how much her time spent in the Beast's castle has transformed both her identity and perspective. Belle claims that she has evolved into a better person as a result of having gotten to know and ultimately fallen in love with the Beast, the same individual she once viewed "with abhorrence and dread". Forced to confront feelings she has never felt before, Belle tries to convince Maurice that the Beast is not the monster he thinks he is while explaining how much she has matured. According to Joey Guerra of the Houston Chronicle, "A Change in Me" "encapsulate[s] the show's sweet emotion." Vladimir Bunoan of ABS-CBNnews.com felt that the ballad "signal[s] a break in [Belle and the Beast's] relationship". "A Change in Me" was originally published in the key of D major, performed at a slow tempo. A "belty" pop ballad often performed within "a plaintive register", its lead vocal spans two octaves, from E3 to F5. Like most of the musical's songs, the melody of "A Change in Me" is borrowed from the film's orchestral score. The New Jersey Monthly summarized "A Change in Me" as "a soaring number about how adventure comes in many forms." Beginning, "There's been a change in me a kind of moving on though what I used to be", the song was identified by author Thomas S. Hischak as a delicate, "moving ballad". Lyrically, the song is "about being at peace with oneself and how it’s expected as you grow up." It has also been described as "uplifting", featuring the lyrics "I never thought I’d leave behind / My childhood dreams / But I don’t mind / I’m where and who I want to be". The chorus ends "Now I love the world I see / No change of heart–a change in me". Vocally, "A Change in Me" is considered to be one of the musicals two "most commanding ballads", alongside "Home", another song Belle performs in the production. == Reception and impact == When Braxton debuted "A Change in Me" during her opening night at the Palace Theatre on September 9, 1998, critics and audiences immediately praised the addition of the new song and Braxton's performance overall. The Drama Review wrote, "As she approached the chorus of 'A Change in Me,' Braxton let loose a vocal wail that seemed to send a shuddering rush through to the back of the audience." Braxton subsequently performed the song live on The Rosie O'Donnell Show on October 7, 1998. Braxton was costumed in Belle's dress, while the stage was decorated to resemble a star-lit foggy night. Describing Braxton as "angelic", BroadwayBox.com called her performance "absolutely stunning." Disney executive Michael Eisner, who attended Braxton's first show, was so pleased with the ballad that he decided "A Change in Me" should be written into every other production of Beauty and the Beast that was running at the time. Ross spent the next month personally traveling to several different cities, where he taught the song to the various companies. Establishing itself as an "irreplaceable spotlight" and "crowd pleaser", "A Change in Me" has remained part of the show's set list ever since Braxton's departure in February 1999. Braxton would go on to star in Disney's Broadway musical Aida. The ballad has continued to receive praise in subsequent iterations of Beauty and the Beast, particularly touring and regional productions. The Lodi News-Sentinel dubbed "A Change in Me" one of the musical's "new favorites". Tamara Ikenberg of the Alaska Dispatch News described the song as "a gorgeous, revelatory piece". The New Jersey Monthly called the ballad a musical highlight. Individual performers are often commended for their renditions. Bob Curtright of The Wichita Eagle complimented actress Jillian Butterfield's "clear soprano" for "captur[ing] the right moods" on musical numbers such as “A Change in Me". In a separate review of Beauty and the Beast for the same publication, Curtright called the ballad "absolutely lovely." The Seattle's Child's Kelly Rogers Flynt wrote, "Not only does the song help the storyline, it also gives Jillian Butterfield a chance to shine." Jennifer Perry, writing for Maryland Theatre Guide, called actress Emily Behny's rendition "very memorable and displays her sweet soprano and strong belt." In the Fayetteville Flyer, Michelle Parks called actress Hilary Mailberger's voice "particularly gorgeous on 'A Change in Me'". Michael Grossberg of The Columbus Dispatch agreed that Mailberger's rendition "is a second-act highlight". Contributing to Silverkris, Rachel AJ Lee wrote that the actress' "strong and harmonious voice ... shone" during "A Change in Me". Gale Shapiro of the South Florida Insider deemed "A Change in Me" actress Brooke Pointanas' "best spot" in the entire show. The Houston Chronicle's Everett Evans described "A Change in Me" as a "serviceable ballad". In a less positive review, Morgan Halaska of the Twin Cities Daily Planet felt that the ballad only "unravels everything Belle is supposed to be in its attempt to explain Belle’s motive to ditch her dreams for a dude", concluding, "She comes off as weak, nothing like the strong, independent woman she embodied in Act I." L. Nicholls, writing for the Edmonton Journal, dismissed "A Change in Me" as a "sappy pop ballad", although he commended Butterfield's vocal performance. ==Cover versions== Since "A Change in Me" was introduced four years into Beauty and the Beast's run, the song has not yet been included on any official English-language cast albums. However, it has been recorded for the 2005 Manila, 2008 Madrid and 2009 Barcelona original cast recordings of the musical by various actresses in their native languages. It has since been covered by several artists. Actress Susan Egan, who originated the role of Belle when the show premiered in 1994, had already long left the production by the time "A Change in Me" was introduced. She covered the song for her debut studio album So Far in 2002. Arranged and produced by Craig Barna, Egan's version of "A Change in Me" was the first English-language studio recording of the song. In her role as Kristen, actress Ashley Brown performed the song in the jukebox musical Disney's On the Record in 2005, which also appears on the original cast recording. Brown would eventually play Belle in the Broadway production of Beauty and the Beast, performing "A Change in Me" several times during her tenure. Brown also sang the song live in the concert "The Originals: Disney on Broadway" at the D23 Expo in 2015. Actress Anneliese van der Pol performed the song on Live with Regis & Kelly in 2008, shortly before the musical closed on Broadway. Actress Kissy Simmons covered the song live on the Disney Wonder cruise ship as part of the Disney Theatrical Group's concert series Stars Set Sail in 2016. Although Disney decided against using any songs from the stage musical in their 2017 live- action adaptation of the film, "A Change in Me" is briefly referenced during Belle's (Emma Watson) solo in the original song "Days in the Sun". Watson's contribution shares similar themes with "A Change in Me". == References == Category:1990s ballads Category:1998 songs Category:Songs from Beauty and the Beast (franchise) Category:Songs with music by Alan Menken Category:Songs with lyrics by Tim Rice Category:Toni Braxton songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Walt Disney Records singles

Developed by Andrew Plotkin, the game is written in version five of the Inform programming language, and compiled for the Z-machine, a virtual machine that allows interactive fiction to be played on a variety of platforms. On June 24, 2014, Plotkin shared A Change in the Weather source code for "personal, educational use only." The game tied for first place in the Inform category of the 1995 Interactive Fiction Competition. As one of six IF games recommended by CU Amiga in 1998, Jason Compton called A Change in the Weather "Very, very hard, it challenges IF conventions and makes you think (and save your game) quite a lot." Interactive fiction scholar Nick Montfort called it "remarkable ... for its attempts to integrate the typical sorts of adventure-game puzzles with the description of landscape, the simulation of an animal character, and the emotional situation of the 'adventurer' player character". A Change in the Weather is included in the game collection that comes with the popular IF interpreter Frotz for the iPhone. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Video games with available source code Category:1990s interactive fiction Category:1995 video games

The film stars Charles Clary, Adrienne Kroell, Timmy Sheehan and Julius Frankenberg. The film status is uncertain but a release flier survives which is now at the Margaret Herrick Library at the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, it was part of the Charles G. Clarke collection. It was released on April 5, 1913 with two reels. ==Plot== Warren, the chief clerk in the war office sadly realizes his job is in jeopardy with a new hood of convictions that leads him to follow the dictates of his heart, so he braves the wintry winds of a February storm to visit the fair Iñez at the Mexican embassy. He boldly tells her of his love—in spite of whatever the new powers may fatalize. The fair one with the coquetry of her sex, teases him, but leads him hopefully along by indirection. He starts to go, telling her that he will come for his answer "on the fourth of March", a notoriously busy day in Washington. The girl from the golden land of Mexico, shows her mettle by springing to a large desk calendar and tearing off the leaves till they show the date of March 4. Thus she leaves him in no doubt as to her answer, which is as agreeable to the entire family as the scene demonstrates. The next morning, the retiring Secretary of War give his trusty clerk chief a formidably sealed document (the secret valuable formula of a high explosive that the government had acquired). Warren is about to put this prize package in his safe for further safety, when the fair Iñez appears. In answer to her curious inquiries, he tells her that the package is one of the great value and would be highly prized by any foreign power - that it would mean big money to them, hence is care in looking after it so closely. Her curiosity is seemingly satisfied. Later in the day, he receives a formal blue envelope of dismissal and realizes that the blow to his fortunes has fallen. He is however, philosophic about it and his house in order. When Iñez hears this news, she is far from pleased and immediately lays in train some plan for continuing and honest man in office and doing away with the chance of allowing a weak and dishonest one to supplant them in the public service. This comes about through her meeting with the new appointee, Lester whom she instinctively doubts. They happen to meet in a Broker's office - and from what she gleams from the Broke, and observes her with her own eyes, as Lester nervously studies the ticker, she sees to plainly his financial desperation due to heavy losses. Iñez is by nature, a schemer and a diplomat and having made a favorable impression upon the vain and weak Lester, she secures a conference with him at the Broker's office in which she adroitly admits that she is a spy for her country. She further describes a certain sealed document in the War Office with which she is anxious to familiarize herself. She describes the outward appearance of the document with such accuracy that no one could mistake it, and having presented the case, she goes home and drops Lester a note: "If you find that you need money and can secure the document described, bring it to me at the Inaugural Ball". ==Cast== * Charles Clary - Warren, chief clerk in the war office * Harry J.

26367592	A Change of Climate	A Change of Climate is a novel by English author Hilary Mantel, first published in 1994 by Viking Books. At the time The Observer described it as the best book she had written.Front cover, Harper Perennial edition, publ 2005 It was published in the United States by Henry Holt in 1997 and was recognised by the New York Times Book Review as one of the notable books of that year. The novel has also been identified as one of the best of the 1990s.The Best Novels of the Nineties by Linda Parent Lesher, page 313, ==Plot introduction== A Change of Climate is set in Norfolk in 1980, and concerns Ralph and Anna Eldred, parents of four children, whose family life threatens to disintegrate in the course of one summer, when memories which they have repressed fiercely for twenty years resurface to disrupt the purposive and peaceful lives they have tried to lead since a catastrophic event overtook them early in their married life. The action of the novel moves back to the late 1950s, when they worked for a missionary society in a dangerous and crowded South African township, and then follows the couple to Bechuanaland, where in the loneliness of a remote mission station an unspeakable loss occurs. The novel is about the possibility or impossibility of forgiveness, the clash of ideals and brutality, and the need to acknowledge that lives are broken before they can begin to be mended. ==Inspiration== Mantel states that the idea for the book came in two parts. In Botswana in 1977 she read law reports about medicine murders and the theft of children; later she heard of an 'apparently happily married couple who suddenly split up after doing all the hard work of bringing up a family'. Mantel brought these two parts of the story together to form the novel. She goes on to reveal that the novel was the most difficult she had ever written (as of 2010) as she struggled with its formal plot and structure.Post script to 2010 paperback edition of The Giant, O'Brien, publ. Fourth Estate, ==Reception== *complete review concluded that of the reviews it sampled "Most very impressed, but not quite a consensus.

39684157	A Change of Heart (Bernard Butler song)	"A Change of Heart" is the third single from Bernard Butler released in June 1998. It is the final single taken from the album People Move On and charted at number 45 on the UK Singles Chart. The final single from People Move On had a lesser impact than previous singles, "Stay" and "Not Alone", at least in terms of radio airplay. "A Change of Heart" features another string arrangement courtesy of Billy McGee, who featured on previous single "Not Alone" and on "Yes", Butler's collaboration with David McAlmont. Ned Raggett of AllMusic wrote: "the pace of the track is gentler and sweeter throughout, feeling big without wanting to totally stomp down the doors. Sakamoto's drumming is quite fine, and the cinematic reach Butler favors still remains, offset by quieter moments with just piano and/or vocals." The music video for the title song was directed by David Mould. ==Single track listings== # "A Change of Heart" # "My Domain" # "More Than I Thought" ==References== Category:1998 singles Category:Songs written by Bernard Butler Category:Creation Records singles Category:1998 songs
31043531	A Change of Heart (How I Met Your Mother)	"A Change of Heart" is the 18th episode of the sixth season of the CBS sitcom How I Met Your Mother and the 130th episode overall. It originally aired on February 28, 2011. After Nora announces her intention to marry and settle down, Barney is worried; meanwhile, Robin's new boyfriend displays idiosyncrasies that remind her friends of a dog. The episode received a fairly positive reception, with 9.24 million watching the episode when it first aired. Some critics found elements of the plot cheesy, although the plot twist and character interactions were complimented. ==Plot== Chastened by Marshall's father's fatal heart attack, the gang all go to get their hearts checked, except Barney, who is too scared to go alone. Lily agrees to accompany him so long as Barney promises her to never lie to his new girlfriend, Nora. When Barney visits the cardiologist, she requests that he wear a heart monitor for 24 hours, citing a possible arrhythmia. The next day, Barney and Lily return to the doctor, who notices some oddities in the readout. She asks Barney what happened at these certain times, and Barney tells the story of the last 24 hours. At dinner, Barney became worried when Nora began talking about marriage and settling down; he claims he wants the same things. After dinner, Barney blackmails the group into pretending this is true. Nora tells everyone that her parents are in town and invites Barney to meet them the next day. However, Barney admits that he was lying about wanting to get married and Nora slaps him. Lily and the cardiologist also slap him when he tells the story. Lily insists that Barney genuinely does want to settle down and get married, but when Barney denies this, Lily has the cardiologist check what happened when Barney first saw Nora on their date. They see that Barney's heart literally skipped a beat, which he and Lily interpret as a sign he really wants to settle down. Barney goes to the brunch to tell Nora about his feelings; seeing her with her parents. However, he loses his nerve and leaves before Nora sees him. Meanwhile, Robin plans to get a dog, but Ted forbids it because he thinks that he will end up caring for it. Instead, based on Marshall's advice, Robin finds a boyfriend. He is nicknamed Scooby, and his behavior closely mimics a dog, which causes the gang to make a series of puns and jokes, to Robin's annoyance. When Robin goes to work, Scooby and the rest of the gang consume marijuana (with Ted replacing it with sandwiches in his story to his kids). While the others are high, Scooby goes missing. They eventually find him urinating on a fire hydrant, only for him to get hit by a car when he runs across the street. The episode ends with a flashback of an incident involving Marshall in 2006, which explains the event Barney referenced when blackmailing him. Marshall drops a calzone while walking on the street, but picks it up after ensuring that nobody is looking at him. As he takes his first bite, however, he sees Barney nearby and slowly walks away in embarrassment. ==Reception== ===Ratings=== "A Change of Heart" first aired on February 28, 2011, garnering 9.24 million views on CBS and a 5.6/9 Nielsen rating. In Australia, the episode aired on May 5 to an audience of 0.671 million households. ===Reviews=== Donna Bowman of The A.V. Club gave the episode a rating of A−, criticizing the episode for being "sappy" but describing herself as "impressed" by the twist ending to the scene with Nora's parents. Angel Cohn of Television Without Pity graded the episode at B−. Robert Canning of IGN gave the episode a rating of 8.5 out of 10, saying that Nora was likeable and that he enjoyed the interaction between the friends, who even managed to make "silly filler plots" enjoyable. ==References== ==External links== * Category:How I Met Your Mother (season 6) episodes Category:2011 American television episodes
39688475	A Change of Heart (TV series)	A Change of Heart (), is a Hong Kong television modern drama serial produced by Nelson Cheung, starring Michael Miu, Bosco Wong, Niki Chow, Joey Meng and Mandy Wong. It premiered on TVB Jade in Hong Kong on June 3, 2013. ==Story== The story primarily focuses on the karmic life between Siu-Kat Yuen (Niki Chow) and Chi Lik "Power" Fong (Michael Miu). Siu-Kat is a HK police officer and commander of her own investigative squad. A dutiful cop, she works hard to maintain order and justice, however, secretly, she's on a personal quest to find her mother's killer. Unfortunately, her journey would lead to many tragedies as well as revelations to the people around her and the unusual connections of her past, present, and future. Siu-Kat's mother was once a showgirl that had fallen on hard times. Desperate for financial survival for both mother and daughter, she became a prostitute to survive; it was a life she wanted to leave and planned for a fresh start once she had enough saved. Unfortunately, she was robbed and was killed for her money; it left Siu-Kat an orphan and that anger and need for justice drove her to become a cop. The only clue she had was a man with a dragon shaped tattoo on his left arm running out from her apartment before her mother was killed. However, she was never able to resolve the case and continued her career as a cop. Siu-Kat would eventually have a romantic relationship with Dr. Yat San Yiu (Bosco Wong), a cardiologist and loving boyfriend. As the two got closer, Yat-San wanted to marry Siu-Kat, but she always resisted due to her personal past history. However, she eventually told Yat-San of her past and he wanted to help her move forward with her life, but she only felt he was interfering in her personal matters. After learning that Yat-San also tragically lost his mother (drowning accident while attempting to save someone), she became more understanding and the two later reconciled over their differences and even agree to marry, but it wouldn't be so as Yat-San died after saving an old lady from falling roof tiles. He suffered a fractured skull and was proven to be brain dead, as his final wish, he was a registered organ donor and his heart would be given to one of the most powerful businessman in HK, Power. Power is the ruthless CEO of Lik Chi Ko (LCK) Enterprises. He's a raging executive that uses his power to dominate and force people to bow to his will in order to realize his capitalistic ambitions. His greatest vision is to reclaim a series of old estates to re-develop those territories into the latest commercial zone as Sleepless City; unfortunately, he suffers from a heart condition that has been slowly eating away his health. His wife, Sin-Hang Tong (Joey Meng), is a trained nurse and has been managing his health as he continues to pursue his mega real estate ambition while tempering his stressing nature. Things would change after his encounter with Dr. Yiu. Although Power was suffering from heart complications, he continues to be impatient, angry, and irritable to everyone around him, including the medical staff caring for him. After his original primary doctor died in an unfortunate accident, Dr. Yiu became his primary doctor and had a good temperament to manage Power and eventually earned his respect. As time passed, Power's health declined drastically and he was near death when he got news that they have a donor. Little did Power know that Dr. Yiu died earlier and that his heart would be transferred onto him. With a new heart and a second chance on life, Power returned to LCK with a new perspective on life. Through a combination of a renewed chance for life and inheriting the goodness from Dr. Yiu's heart, Power began to show a change in personality. He's no longer as ruthless and unforgiving as he used to; he began to work in more social development-based causes and even treated his staff around him with a more pleasant attitude. He also inherited Dr. Yiu's taste for sweets and his sense of moral/ethical responsibilities. It was because of his change of heart that would become the prelude to many things, including atoning for his past. While Siu-Kat was devastated over Dr. Yiu's death, she was surprised to meet her fiancé's younger twin brother, Yuet-San. Although they look and sound exactly alike, Yuet-San is the less responsible one. Yuet-San personally watched his mother drown because she tried to save someone; moral responsibility became a joke afterwards as it cost his mother's life. He became a wandering vagrant and developed less reputable skills such as con-artistry and bar tending. After Yat-San's death, Yuet-San wanted to do more for his surviving great aunt and unofficially replaced Yat-San; he moved into his brother's apartment and even lived with Yat-San's best friend and roommate, Dr. Sin Chi "Eason" Tong (Vincent Wong). Because of his brother's memory, both Siu-Kat and Eason would voice disappointment over Yuet-San's nonchalant irresponsible nature. Things would change dramatically for Yuet-San when Power decided to help him. Perhaps out of a sense of life-debt to Dr. Yiu and/or a connection with Yuet-San, Power took notice of Yuet-San and helped him relieve all of his major debts and arranged him to work as a bartender at his night club. Over time, Power would learn to appreciate Yuet-San and had him promoted multiple times and fast-tracked him as his new right-hand man in his operations. However, all of Power's recent actions, along with Yuet-San, didn't sit well with Power's wife, Sin-Hang. Sin-Hang is the elder half-sister to Eason. Eason's father made a selfish decision to abandon his previous family for the sake of greater financial gain with his new one, however, his actions would indirectly lead to many tragedies. Sin-Hang watched her mother die from illness (her father wouldn't see her mother in her final moments) and the fact her father chose Eason's family over hers made Sin-Hang into a resentful person. Although she had other relatives to help raise her, she was often abused; all of this negativity shaped Sin-Hang into the manipulative, ruthless, and spiteful woman that she is today. She loves Power greatly and would do anything for him, but she begins to distant herself from him as she couldn't stand Power's new sense of social and personal responsibility for his many years of wrongdoings. After Power recovered from his heart condition, Sin-Hang developed a more powerful seat with the board at LCK Enterprises and she began to lust for more power. She originally teamed up with Martin (Benjamin Yuen), Power's original right-hand-man, to help Power maintain his CEO seat as well as help gather funds for the Sleepless City project; Power showed gradual disinterest in the project and focused more on philanthropy and dedicating funds to more social responsible causes, a series of disappointing decisions. Around that same time, Siu-Kat also developed an unusual friendship with Power as she was partially drawn to him because Dr. Yiu's heart lives through him. Their odd semi-friendship lead Sin-Hang to think she's not appreciated anymore and started an affair with Martin. Concurrently, Power assigned Yuet-San to go undercover for him to keep tabs on his wife's activities, however, that lead to misunderstands and negative feelings from his friends and family. In between, Siu-Kat started to date Yuet-San; it was hard for her due to his resemblance to Yat-San. She later put their relationship on hold while investigating her mother's death. Secretly, Eason and Sai Kau Yip (her subordinate, god-father, and father to Wing-Yan) started to look into the case for her and later collaborated with her. At first, the trio had circumstantial evidence to suggest Power had something to do with Siu-Kat's mother's death due to the similar tattoo he had. Due to Siu-Kat's overzealous nature, she had Power arrested and he confessed that he stole money from her mother, but never killed her. By chance, a piece of jewelry from the crime scene was found and it linked to Sai-Kau's (Benz Hui) wife (Akina Hong) as the killer. Sai-Kau tried to help his wife escape, but Siu-Kat caught up to them and learned that Sai-Kau's wife stole money from Siu-Kat's mom, but she tried to stop her and accidentally pushed her to the floor, where she landed on top of a glass shard that killed her. The revelation was heartbreaking to Siu-Kat as she loved her God-father and his family; both Wing-Yan and Sai-Kau kneel and begged for mercy, but Mrs.Yip was ultimately arrested and sentenced for secondary degree manslaughter. Power was also jailed for a couple of months on the charges of robbery and assault. Sin-Hang and Martin eventually put themselves in a difficult situation. In their quest to help Power attain more funds, they aligned themselves with a triad boss. The deal was that Sin-Hang would help use LCK Enterprises to help clean his dirty money in exchange for his resources to keep the Sleepless City project afloat, but things went awry when Power was released and realized what was happening; Power seized those assets and threatened the triad boss with the police to end their ties. The triad boss didn't take things well and decided to teach Power a lesson by slashing his wife's beautiful face, causing Sin- Hang to have a 4-inch scar on her face. To return a favor, Power had his agents attack the triad boss's house in Thailand and threatened to kill him and his family; Power ultimately had them released as he reasons his death would result in a vicious cycle of vengeance and reminded the importance of learning to let go of things. Sin-Hang's life would continue to fall apart as her web of deception unraveled. Oppa, a cop under Siu-Kat was desperate for money and found incriminating evidence that Sin-Hang threw the tiles that killed Dr. Yiu; he blackmailed her for money. Things wouldn't go well for Oppa after Siu-Kat suspected him and he ran for it. He tried to blackmail more money out of Sin-Hang to escape, but the two ended up in a struggle when Eason came to try to save his sister; he ended up with a serious head injury. As Oppa was running, Siu-Kat caught up to him. He was then knocked down by a car while crossing a road, resulting in his death. Although she felt guilty for her brother, Sin-Hang pretended to show no remorse. She would later see her father as the two looked after Eason, but it was there she said some hateful words, enough to encourage his heart to fail and died, leaving Eason the only family member still alive. Taking advantage of Sin-Hang's fragile mentality, Siu-Kat staged a fake supernatural event in the parking lot, by having Yuet- San put on a doctor's robe to resemble Yat-San, to fool her to think karmic forces are after her. In a confrontation with her weakened will, she revealed to Siu-Kat that it was she who threw the tiles that led to Dr. Yiu's death. Because she confessed with the police recording her, it was used as evidence on top of other alleged crimes and she was sent to jail for processing. However, not long after, the police that were transporting her through a rainy day lost control of their van and it slipped right into the sea and Sin-Hang's body was never recovered; she was presumed dead. With Sin-Hang gone and justice served for both her mother and Yat-San, Siu-Kat's quest for justice left her police record tarnished; since she fulfilled her goals, it was a non- regrettable outcome and she chose to leave the HKPD for some time off. One year later, Eason has married Wing-Yan (the two always had feelings for each other throughout the story) and Yuet-San continues to wait for Siu-Kat's return. Not long after, the two found each other and Siu-Kat agreed to marry Yuet-san. Shortly after, Power received an unusual text from Siu-Kat, with her telling him she doesn't really want to marry Yuet-San, but wants to be with him. Siu-Kat then appears before Power, wanting him to answer about his feelings about her. Power admitted feeling something for her, but he explained he loves his wife very much and can't be with her. It was because of his love for Sin-Hang that Siu-Kat reveals she's really Sin-Hang. Through plastic surgery, she re-made herself a replica of Siu-Kat, believing this would please her husband; she was happy to know Power still loves her. She then reveals that she was planning to kill Power and commit suicide afterwards, but dropped the idea when she realises that she had misunderstood Power all this time. However, Sin-Hang complicated matters as she's still mentally/emotionally unstable and had kidnapped Siu-Kat earlier and hidden her inside a cargo container. However, with Yuet-San, Power, and Siu-Kat's police crew, they helped locate her. However, Sin-Hang died as she sacrificed herself to save Power from heavy-falling cargo. Further time has passed and Power has since focused heavily on social work and his fate within LCK Enterprises is unknown. However, while working on a farm site with some children, he encountered a loving teacher that had a strong resemblance to his dead wife (also played by Joey Meng), suggesting he'll try to start a new life with her. Elsewhere, at the grand opening of the LCK Community Centre, Siu-kat and Yuet-San are now happily married. It was never revealed if she returned to HKPD, but she quietly says to Yat-San that she's in a better place. ==Cast and characters== *Michael Miu as Fong Chi Lik (方自力), nicknamed Power, the ruthless CEO of Lik Chi Ko Enterprises that suffers from coronary heart disease.

49371117	A Change of Heart (The 1975 song)	"A Change of Heart" is a song by English band the 1975 from their second studio album, I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It (2016). The song was written by Matty Healy, George Daniel, Adam Hann and Ross MacDonald. Mike Crossey handled the production alongside Daniel and Healy. The song was released on 22 February 2016 by Dirty Hit and Polydor Records as the fifth single from the album. A synth-pop and electropop power ballad, the song features 808 beats, a portamento keyboard riff, pulsing synthesisers and elements of ambient pop, electro, new wave, yacht rock, chillwave and indie rock. The song's melancholic lyrics describe falling out of love and detail the end of a romance, focusing on the theme of technology. Upon release, "A Change of Heart" received positive reviews from contemporary music critics, who praised the lyrics and production. The song later appeared on several year-end lists. Commercially, it reached number 127 on the UK Singles Chart, number 47 on the US Billboard Hot Rock & Alternative Songs and number 36 on the Billboard Alternative Airplay charts. The song was later certified silver in the United Kingdom by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). An accompanying music video, written by Healy and directed by Tim Mattia, was released on 21 April 2016. The black and white tragicomic visual is based on Federico Fellini's film I clowns (1970), and follows Healy as a Pierrot-style clown engaging in a short-lived romance at an abandoned carnival. == Background and release == During the song's premiere on Annie Mac's self-titled BBC Radio 1 show, Healy described it as a "simple song – three notes – and the truth" and a "very atypical '1975' song", saying the band wanted the track to convey serious conviction, self-awareness and beauty. On 22 February 2016, "A Change of Heart" was officially released as the album's fifth single. == Music and lyrics == Musically, "A Change of Heart" is a low-tempo synth-pop and electropop power ballad. The song has a length of four minutes and 43 seconds (4:43). Containing a retro sound, the track's light and airy production consists of synthetically charged choirs, a percolating rhythm, simple three-note repetitions, a pop hook, 808 beats, a backing drum beat, jittering guitars, a portamento keyboard riff, quietly reverberating and meandering synthesiser pulses, a whirring synthesiser solo, lightly-tapped synth pads and a calming rock instrumentation. It also contains elements of ambient pop, electro, new wave, yacht rock, chillwave and indie rock. Ryan Reed of Rolling Stone described it as a "John Hughes-worthy synth- pop ballad", while James Grebey of Spin called it a "relaxing, floaty throwback to decades past" and Chris Ingalls of PopMatters said it "[sounds] like it was transported from 1987 and wouldn't sound at all out of place on some big-haired college radio DJ's late-night playlist". Lyrically, "A Change of Heart" is a melancholic song that deals with falling out of love. Healy sings of a woman with whom he is romantically involved, before admitting that her appearance alone cannot sustain their relationship. The singer openly admits his superficial flaws, revealing his partner's appearance both initially attracted and later repulsed him. He points out her quirks while making derogatory remarks, singing: "And you were coming across as clever / Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette". Healy also comments on his own behaviour in the couplet "I’ll quote On The Road like a twat". Conversely, the singer's partner says he looks terrible and is riddled with diseases. Returning to the theme of technology explored in "Love Me", the song analyses connection in the digital age, describing a partner more interested in being on their phone than with the relationship. As they become more connected on social media, they become disconnected from one another in reality, with Healy singing: "And then you took a picture of your salad/And put it on the internet". Ultimately, the singer breaks down into tears when the relationship has concluded. == Reception == Upon release, "A Change of Heart" was met with positive reviews from contemporary music critics. Billboard deemed "A Change of Heart" the best rock and alternative song of 2016; describing it as an "incandescent synthpop tale of a relationship crumbling apart", editor Chris Payne praised the songwriting, narrative and alluring quality. Spin ranked the song at number 59 on their 2016 year-end list, with Anna Gaca commending the "exquisitely" gentle sound, haunting synth and "tragically" ironic depiction of modern love, calling it a "wooning, shimmering heartbreaker of a pop ballad". NPR included the track on their mid-year best of 2016 list; Daoud Tyler-Ameen declared it the most undeniable song from I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It. He praised the slight, sweet and underpunctuated lyrics—comparing them to 2016 Twitter poetry—and the singer's accent, saying its "lushness swallows you whole". Paste ranked "A Change of Heart" at number 16 on their list of the 1975's essential songs, calling it the "calm before the relapse in 'Somebody Else. Neil O'Sullivan of Financial Times called "A Change of Heart" excellent, while Maledine Roth of MTV News said the song is a "soul-wrenching (but admittedly beautiful) heap of sadness". Michael Hann of The Guardian called the track bleak and beautiful, deeming the line "You said I’m full of diseases, your eyes were full of regret / And then you took a picture of your salad and you put it on the internet" as 2016's best couplet. Celia Cummiskey of Euphoria Magazine highlighted Healy's delicate vocals and ability to mask a complicated emotional dilemma within the song's "deceptively upbeat" sound, while comparing "A Change of Heart" to Peter Gabriel's work in the 1980s. Annie Zaleski of The A.V. Club said Healy "upends the sensitive-poet stereotype with a knowing wink" and Rhian Daly of NME called the song the most self-referential track on the album. In the 1975's native United Kingdom, "A Change of Heart" peaked at number 127 on the UK Singles Chart and was later certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), denoting sales of over 200,000 units in the UK. In the United States, the song peaked at number 47 on the US Billboard Hot Rock & Alternative Songs. == Music video == An accompanying music video, directed by Tim Mattia, was released on 21 April 2016. The black and white visual is based on Federico Fellini's film I clowns (1970), while also taking inspiration from Michael Jackson's tribute to Charlie Chaplin, The Wiz (1978), Gene Kelly and Bob Fosse. The video features Healy—who wrote the visual—in the role of the protagonist; a Pierrot-style melancholy clown. Regarding the video's meaning, the singer said: "I want to convey the sense of resignation in being a clown. I am, have been and will always be a clown. I think it can tire people." The visual begins with Healy entering an abandoned, yet still operating carnival, and he begins to dance. The singer encounters a female clown and they dance together before running to the bumper cars. The pair adventure throughout the park, illustrating the strengthening of their relationship. Healy and the woman dance, play carnival games, do magic tricks and eat popcorn, while spirited dance sequences are interspersed. Once the weight of their romance becomes apparent, the female clown grows tired of the singer's silliness and leaves him in the video's denouement. The final shot shows Healy alone on a park bench underneath a raincloud, which leaves him soaking wet. Grant Sharples of Alternative Press included "A Change of Heart" on his list of 10 music videos from the 1975 that should be made into feature-length films, saying: "The video is a clever reference to the 1975’s early black-and-white videos, but it adds an old-school cinema twist that’s unique to itself." Gaca commended the "bittersweet" video, calling it tragicomic. Reed also deemed the visual a tragicomedy, praising its vividness while noting it "[charts] the highs and lows of a tragicomic clown romance". Roth praised the "bittersweet" music video, while Tom Connick of DIY said it presents a darker side of clown life, writing: "It’s not all fun and games being a clown... Sometimes, though, it’s actually a bloody nightmare." Payne praised Healy's acting and improvisation, noting the visual likely took a great deal of time to rehearse. == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from I Like It When You Sleep, for You Are So Beautiful yet So Unaware of It album liner notes. * Matthew Healy composer, producer, electric guitar, vocals, background vocals * George Daniel composer, producer, programming, synthesizer programming, drums, keyboards, synthesizer, percussion * Adam Hann composer, electric guitar * Ross MacDonald composer * Mike Crossey producer, programming, mixer * Jonathan Gilmore recording engineer * Chris Gehringer mastering engineer == Charts == Chart (2016) Peak position UK Singles (OCC) 127 ==Certifications== == See also == * The 1975 discography * List of songs by Matty Healy == References == == External links == * Category:2010s ballads Category:2016 singles Category:2016 songs Category:Black-and-white music videos Category:Dirty Hit singles Category:Electropop ballads Category:Polydor Records singles Category:Synth- pop ballads Category:The 1975 songs Category:Songs by Matty Healy

42359908	A Change of Hobbit	A Change of Hobbit (1972–1991) was one of the first science fiction, fantasy and horror bookstores established, and was a significant part of science fiction fandom generally and in Southern California particularly.Duke Helfand, "For Science Fiction Fans, Old Habit Dies Hard : Change of Hobbit Devotees Are Already Mourning Bookstore Demise", Los Angeles Times, Feb. 10, 1991.Sherry Gottlieb, "Escape Velocity: A History of A Change of Hobbit Bookstore" (draft memoir, last visited March 31, 2014). The name references the hobbits from J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings series. The Change of Hobbit bookstore hosted numerous events, including, famously, Harlan Ellison in its front window, writing a story in public view over the course of a week.Harlan Ellison, Strange Wine. The store was also a mainstay on author tours, as Anne Rice noted: "Authors around the world have dreamed of going to the Hobbit for signings. What's a West Coast tour if you can't visit Sherry?" The store was also notable for Gottlieb's pet boa constrictor, "Wrinklesnakeskin". ==History== In 1972, when she was 23-years-old, Gottlieb first opened the store in Westwood Village near UCLA. In a tiny location, 12' x 15' above a laundromat, the store was a success and became a popular Tuesday-night meeting location for authors and fans. A year later she expanded and moved the store a mile away to a larger location on Westwood Boulevard, then a few years later to a Lincoln Boulevard location in Santa Monica. In 1989, Gottlieb moved the store to its final location on 2nd Street in Santa Monica, but then closed the store in 1991. Gottlieb also offered the use of her store's name to colleagues in Berkeley, who in 1977 established The Other Change of Hobbit bookstore; though it no longer has a physical storefront, as of 2021 that store continues to operate in the Bay Area. ==Notes== Category:1972 establishments in California Category:1991 disestablishments Category:Science fiction fandom Category:Fantasy fandom Category:Horror fandom Category:Bookstores in California Category:Retail companies established in 1972
4406467	A Change of Mind	"A Change of Mind" is an episode of the allegorical British science fiction TV series, The Prisoner. It was written by Roger Parkes and directed by Patrick McGoohan and ninth produced. It was the twelfth episode to be broadcast in the UK on ITV (ATV Midlands and Grampian) on Friday 15 December 1967 and first aired in the United States on CBS on Saturday 24 August 1968. The episode stars Patrick McGoohan as Number Six and features as Number Two, John Sharp. Themes explored include coerced confessions and political control via drugs; also conformity, methods of enforcing it, and the consequences of its rejection. ==Plot summary== Number Six pursues his daily exercise routine in the woods. Two young toughs arrive and accuse him of being anti-social for not using the community gym and a fight ensues in which Number Six prevails. In an anteroom to the Council Chamber, a Villager is seen desperately confessing to being "inadequate and anti-social"; he is applauded by others for this admission. Number Six is invited into the committee chamber to confess his lack of cooperation, but sarcastically declines to do so. The Village newspaper, the Tally Ho, reports that Number Six is due for "further investigation". Number Two denies having any influence over the committee but warns of the consequences of non-compliance. Number Eighty-six, an attractive female, chides Number Six for his non-cooperation. Number Six's exposure of a community "rehab" process causes the committee to label him uncooperative. He is taken to the Hospital, where he encounters a Villager with a scar on his temple who says that he had been labelled as "unmutual", but is now cured. Number Six again appears before the committee and is told he will be labelled for "Instant Social Conversion" if he doesn't fall into line. He then reads in the Tally-Ho and hears over the public address system that he is officially "unmutual". Next morning Number Six is thoroughly shunned, and Number Two threatens him again with Social Conversion, which is a sort of lobotomy. Number Six is attacked by the irate Villagers and marched to the Hospital. There he is strapped to a table and the Social Conversion process is explained to a Village television audience by Number Eighty-six, who is the chief technician in charge. Drugged, Number Six is subjected to an ultra-sonic treatment which lobotomises him. At the last second, Number Eighty-six shuts off the ultrasound. Number Six wakes up, apparently docile, returns to the community, and is welcomed by all. In his flat he sees his cup of tea being drugged by Number Eighty-six and pours it away. Number Two arrives and questions Number Six about his resignation, but is rebuffed. Number Two and Number Eighty-six discuss Number Six and reveal that the "ultra-sonic" lobotomy was an intentional sham, meant to convince the subject (in conjunction with the drug) that he has been lobotomised. Number Eighty-six, watching Number Six remove the dressing covering his "operation scar", doubts that he has been properly conditioned, but Number Two insists that all is well. She tries to drug Number Six again, but he takes over the tea-making process, switching the cups so that Number Eighty-six drinks the drugged tea instead. Back at the exercise site in the woods, the thugs again confront Number Six. He initially appears confused and unable to defend himself, but ultimately rallies and prevails. Number Eighty-six, still intoxicated with the drug, is hypnotised by Number Six and explains how the conditioning process was faked; she is given undisclosed instructions by Number Six. Number Six visits Number Two and convinces him that the ploy has worked, informing him that he wants to publicly confess to "everyone". Number Two arranges for the whole village to hear Number Six speak. The programmed Number Eighty-six arrives on cue at the stroke of 4 o'clock and loudly charges Number Two with being "unmutual". The Villagers turn on Number Two, who is forced to flee through the Village streets. ==Cast== * John Sharp . . . Number Two * Angela Browne . . . Number Eighty-Six * George Pravda . . .

2446655	A Change of Pace	A Change of Pace is an American five piece pop punk band from Peoria, Arizona, United States. The band was on both the 2005 and 2006 Warped Tours. ==Biography== A Change of Pace formed in 2001 when singer Torry Jasper and drummer Jonathan Kelly began playing together in freshmen year of high school (while attending Centennial High School). In 2003, after a few years of jamming and playing small local shows, bassist Johnny Abdullah and guitarist Adam Rodgers joined the band. From there they were discovered by manager Jorge Hernandez, and within a few months they were signed to Immortal Records in August 2004, and released their EP Change Is The Only Constant. In 2005 the band released their first full-length album, An Offer You Can't Refuse, and landed a spot on the Warped Tour. Between October and December 2005, the band embarked on the Myspace Fall Tour across the US. In June 2006, Prepare the Masses was announced, and later released on August 15, 2006. In between this, the band appeared on Warped tour again. The band also added a fifth member to the band, Dan Parker (previously in Don't Let Go). They then went on tour with Roses Are Red. In November 2006, they toured the US with Paulson and InMemory. In March and April 2007, A Change of Pace went on a tour with Quietdrive, the Classic Crime, Sullivan, and thebleedingalarm. They then supported Paulson on their headlining tour in June 2007. On June 1, 2008 the band announced that they had parted ways with former vocalist Torry Jasper, and announced a new lead singer, Micah Bentley. They also announced the release of their EP, Just No Better Way. With new singer Micah Bentley they have adopted a lighter tone to their music, contrasting drastically with their previous singer Torry Jasper who screamed vocals in the older material. The band released their third and final album, entitled It Could Be Worse on February 22, 2011. ==Breakup and departure of Micah Bentley== On March 13, 2011, drummer Jon Kelley announced via Facebook that after 10 years, A Change of Pace was calling it quits. Their last show, "A Change of Pace Farewell Show", took place on April 22, at The Clubhouse in Tempe. Opening bands included Greeley Estates, Desole, It's Like Love, and In It for Storms. In April 2011, A Change Of Pace played their final show with singer Micah Bentley as he began to prepare for his solo career. ==Reunion, new album and return of Torry Jasper== On Christmas Day 2011, A Change Of Pace was asked to reunite with Torry Jasper and play the ‘South By So What’ festival in Dallas, Texas on March 17 of 2012. After several discussions, the band agreed to perform at the festival with other acts such as The Early November, Motion City Soundtrack, HelloGoodbye and Cartel.

795149	A Change of Seasons	A Change of Seasons is the first EP by American progressive metal band Dream Theater, first released on September 19, 1995, through East West Records. It comprises the 23-minute title track and a collection of live cover songs performed at a fan club concert on January 31, 1995, at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London. The title track was recorded at BearTracks Studios in New York and was originally slated to be released on the 1992 album Images and Words, but was instead re-recorded and released as an EP. Although the song includes audio samples from the 1989 film Dead Poets Society (as well as quotes from the 1648 Robert Herrick poem, To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time), the lyrics, written by drummer Mike Portnoy, were not inspired by the film. Instead, "it's about the cycle of life. Basically, I took a lot of personal incidents, like losing my mother and a couple of things that happened in my life, and I wrote them into the lyrics." The back cover has a calendar displaying the date November 16, the date Portnoy's mother died. A Change of Seasons was also the first Dream Theater release featuring Derek Sherinian on keyboards. Excerpts from the title track were used by NBC in a segment on downhill skiing during the 2002 Winter Olympics.YouTube.com Although the record is labeled as an EP, its running time of 57:30 makes it significantly longer than a standard EP, and even many LPs, including Dream Theater's first two albums. According to Portnoy, "It was important for us and the label for it not to be perceived as the latest studio record. That's why we tagged it an EP." == Track listing == == Credits == === Dream Theater === *James LaBrie – vocals *John Myung – bass *John Petrucci – guitar *Mike Portnoy – drums *Derek Sherinian – keyboards === Production === *David Prater – producer, mixing *Doug Oberkircher – engineer (track 1), mixing *Andy Scarth – engineer (tracks 2-5) *Robert Siciliano – assistant engineer *Ted Jensen – mastering at Sterling Sound, NYC *Mike Portnoy – cover concept *Larry Freemantle – art direction *Joseph Cultice – photography == Chart performance == Chart (1995) Peak position German Albums (Offizielle Top 100) 50 US Billboard 200"A Change of Seasons – Dream Theater | Awards".

15131446	A Change of Seasons (film)	A Change of Seasons is a 1980 American comedy-drama film directed by Richard Lang. It stars Anthony Hopkins, Shirley MacLaine and Bo Derek. The film was a critical and commercial failure, grossing $7.2 million against its $6 million budget and receiving three nominations at the 1st Golden Raspberry Awards including Worst Actor (Hopkins) and Worst Screenplay. ==Plot== When Karyn Evans discovers her arrogantly self-centered professor husband Adam is having an affair with student Lindsey Rutledge, she is out for Revenge. She retaliates by having a dalliance of her own with philosophical campus carpenter Pete Lachappelle. Adam is infuriated when he learns about his wife's new relationship, and she in turn defends her right to enjoy the same carnal pleasures he does. The four decide to share a Vermont ski house, where their efforts to behave like liberal people are tested by angst, hurt feelings, and Kasey Evans, who unexpectedly arrives to confront her parents with their outrageous behavior, who makes sure to put her parents back on the right track. ==Production notes== The film was shot on location in Glenwood Springs, Colorado and Williamstown, Massachusetts. Hopkins and MacLaine famously did not get along during the filming, and Hopkins said "she was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with." The theme song "Where Do You Catch the Bus for Tomorrow?" was written by Alan and Marilyn Bergman and Henry Mancini and performed by Kenny Rankin. Originally, Noel Black was hired to direct after producer Martin Ransohoff had seen his film, A Man, a Woman, and a Bank (1979). Black left the film during shooting due to creative differences. He was replaced by Richard Lang. Black shot the first half of the film only. Consenting Adults was the film's working title. ==Principal cast== *Shirley MacLaine ..... Karyn Evans *Anthony Hopkins ..... Adam Evans *Bo Derek ..... Lindsey Rutledge *Michael Brandon ..... Pete Lachapelle *Mary Beth Hurt ..... Kasey Evans *Edward Winter ..... Steven Rutledge *K Callan ..... Alice Bingham *Rod Colbin ..... Sam Bingham *Steve Eastin ..... Lance *Billy Beck ..... Older Man *Karen Philipp ..... Young Girl *Paul Bryar ..... Man at Table ==Critical reception== In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby said the film "exhibits no sense of humor and no appreciation for the ridiculous ... the screenplay [is] often dreadful ... the only appealing performance is Miss MacLaine's, and she's too good to be true. A Change of Seasons does prove one thing, though. A farce about characters who've been freed of their conventional obligations quickly becomes aimless." Variety observed, "It would take the genius of an Ernst Lubitsch to do justice to the incredibly tangled relationships in A Change of Seasons, and director Richard Lang is no Lubitsch. The switching of couples seems arbitrary and mechanical, and more sour than amusing." TV Guide rates it one out of a possible four stars, adding the film "is as predictable as a long Arctic winter, and just about as interesting ... Marybeth Hurt ... steals what there is of the picture to steal." Time Out London calls it "kitsch without conviction, schlock without end ... glib trappings ... and witless dialogue sink everything except for the perky intelligence of MacLaine, who clearly deserves better than this."Time Out London review ==Awards and nominations== The film had the dubious distinction of garnering three nominations at the first Golden Raspberry Awards. * Nominated, Worst Actor (Anthony Hopkins) * Nominated, Worst Song (Where Do You Catch the Bus for Tomorrow? by Henry Mancini, Marilyn Bergman, Alan Bergman) * Nominated, Worst Screenplay (Erich Segal, Ronni Kern, and Fred Segal) ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:1980 films Category:1980 comedy-drama films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:Films scored by Henry Mancini Category:American comedy-drama films Category:Films directed by Richard Lang (director) Category:Midlife crisis films Category:1980s English-language films Category:1980s American films
50000659	A Change of Sex	A Change of Sex is a multi-part television documentary about English trans woman Julia Grant. The first chapter, initially titled George, premiered on BBC2 in 1979. It is one of the first documentary films about transgender issues. BBC2 repeated the programme in 1980, followed by two new chapters, Julia: The First Year and Julia: My Body, My Choice. A revised version aired in 1994, accompanied by another new chapter, The Untold Story, which updates viewers on Julia's life of the past 15 years. The final instalment, Julia Gets Her Man, followed in 1999. David Pearson directed the films. Julia Grant was born in 1954. The documentary introduces us to her as George Roberts, a catering manager. Although she performs as a drag queen, George says she has never felt at home in gay male culture. She feels inside that she is a woman, and she wishes for sex reassignment surgery. The National Health Service refers her to the Gender Identity Clinic at Charing Cross Hospital. As she sits in the consulting room, we hear the voice of her psychiatrist, but we never see his face. His attitude toward Grant is stern and disparaging. His deskside manner was the inspiration for the character Dr Ira Carlton, a "despotic GP who rules his patients with eccentric zeal" in the black comedy series The League of Gentlemen. Beyond the consulting room, the filmmakers follow Julia through her experiences of hormone therapy, shopping for women's clothing, gender confirmation surgeries, her professional life, and other dimensions of her transition. Julia Grant died on 2 January 2019, aged 64. ==Production and broadcast== A Change of Sex began as an episode of Inside Story, a documentary television series oriented toward investigative journalism. There was sufficient interest in the episode, titled George, for Pearson to explore Grant's story further. He and his crew filmed her progress in 1979 and 1980. George was retitled George: The Big Decision, and the more recent footage was edited into two new chapters: Julia: The First Year and Julia: My Body, My Choice. This three-film series was titled A Change of Sex, and BBC2 broadcast it in October 1980. New English Library published Grant's autobiography, George and Julia, that same month. In 1993, Pearson revisited Grant to film a fourth chapter of the documentary about her life. Filming and editing continued into 1994, but the earlier programmes were also edited in order to make a four-part story into a trilogy: George & Julia, Desperate Measures, and The Untold Story. This revised version of A Change of Sex aired on BBC2 in August 1994. The broadcast coincided with the publication of Grant's second memoir, Just Julia: The Story of an Extraordinary Woman. In 1998, Pearson filmed Grant once more. BBC2 repeated the 1994 edition of the previous films in July and August 1999 before broadcasting the final chapter, Julia Gets Her Man. It updates viewers on developments in Grant's life over the past four years, including a new job and a growing relationship. ===Broadcast history=== ====George (Inside Story episode)==== ====A Change of Sex==== 1994 and 1999 broadcasts No. Title Air date 1994 broadcast 1999 broadcast == Reception and legacy == The psychiatrist's deskside manner was the inspiration for the character Dr Ira Carlton, a "despotic GP who rules his patients with eccentric zeal" in the black comedy series The League of Gentlemen. ==See also== ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * * Category:Biographical documentary films Category:Transgender- related documentary films Category:Transgender-related television shows Category:Transgender in the United Kingdom Category:Documentary films about businesspeople Category:Documentary films about women in the United Kingdom Category:1970s British LGBT-related television series Category:1970s English- language films *[No.]: Number

The couple is making their way from Mexico City to Veracruz for a vacation.

Once the two couples have left Mexico, they visit the pre-Columbian ruins at Xochicalco and then the pyramids at Cholula. Their car is sabotaged, forcing them to spend the night in Cholula. There they are joined by the ubiquitous Narrator, who is also en route to Cholula, just to complicate matters even more. ==Acclaim for the book== * "At any rate, politically objectionable or not, Fuentes has written a challenging and interesting, if occasionally silly and pretentious, book." -David Gallagher, The New York Times * "defines existentially a collective Mexican consciousness by exploring and reinterpreting the country’s myths." -Encyclopædia Britannica * "...human history is envisioned as an obsessively repeated mythic drama or cycle." -Edith Grossman, "Myth and Madness in Carlos Fuentes' 'A Change of Skin'" * It received the 1967 Premio Biblioteca Breve for best unpublished novel. ==References== Category:1967 novels Category:Novels by Carlos Fuentes Category:Mexican novels

Hiroshi Yosano grows poor attempting to continue circulation of the magazine Bright Star. After attending the opera, Akiko is knocked over by a motorcycle driven by the author Takeo Arishima. He sends her a Western outfit as an apology gift but she brings it back to his home to return it to him. The editor Akiko Hatano pressures Arishima to provide an essay about suicide for her publication but he is reluctant to do so.

14176306	A Charge to Keep	A Charge to Keep is a 1999 book written by then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush, with a foreword by Karen Hughes. Later editions have the sub-title My Journey To The White House. ==Overview== The book contains a brief overview of Bush's life and political philosophy. It is not an autobiography in the strict sense, but rather a collection of non-chronological sketches and anecdotes about his years at Yale and Harvard, business career, and time as governor of Texas. He intersperses these with brief explanations of his political philosophy, including his belief in small government, capitalism, and a strong national defense. More specific parts of his program, which he enumerates in the last pages, include creating a free market alliance with Canada and Latin America, privatizing Social Security, and firmness with non-aligned regimes, particularly Iraq and North Korea (pp. 238–9). The book has been described as containing only few revelations, among them Bush's account of his decision not to grant a stay of execution for Karla Faye Tucker, which he described as affecting him emotionally, contrary to media criticism at the time. Ghostwriter Michael Herskowitz was hired in 1999 to draft the book, but he was dismissed and Hughes took over after "the early chapters Herskowitz submitted were judged to overemphasize W.'s early difficulties, describing him, for instance, as having been unsuccessful in the oil business."Jacob Weisberg: "The Bush Tragedy". Excerpt, The New York Times, published February 1, 2008 The proceeds of the book were donated to charity. == Origin of the title == The title of the book comes from the hymn, "A Charge to Keep I Have" (1762) by Charles Wesley. Wesley's title is a paraphrase of : "keep the charge of the LORD, so that you may not die." A painting by W.H.D. Koerner, lent to Bush, shows a horseman charging up a rugged mountain trail, followed by others. In the book, Bush says this scene "epitomizes our mission": The painting hung on the west wall of the Oval Office during Bush's presidency. He has explained to journalists that its title is "based upon a religious hymn. The hymn talks about serving God."The Oval Office: Interview of the President by Kai Diekmann of BILD. May 5, 2006 The phrase "A Charge to Keep" was attached to the painting because it was used to illustrate a short story of this title by Ben Ames Williams published in 1918 by Country Gentleman magazine."Horseshit! Bush and the Christian Cowboy " According to Jacob Weisberg, Bush "came to believe that the picture depicted the circuit-riders who spread Methodism across the Alleghenies in the nineteenth century. In other words, the cowboy who looked like Bush was a missionary of his own denomination." == Contents == * Foreword * Reflections by Karen Hughes # A Charge to Keep # Midland Values # "What Texans Can Dream, Texans Can Do" # Yale and the National Guard # Harvard and Moving Home # Reading: The New Civil Right # The Best Decision I Ever Made # Naming the Team # Working Together # The Big 4-0 # Karla Faye Tucker and Henry Lee Lucas # Tides # The Veto # Baseball # A Time to Build # A Compassionate Conservative ==See also== *Decision Points ==References== Category:Books about George W.

The novels have been adapted by Jeremy Front into a comedy-drama series for BBC Radio, starring Bill Nighy. Brett was inspired to write the Charles Paris series after working on the BBC radio adaptations of Lord Peter Wimsey:https://www.suffolklibraries.co.uk/posts/meet-the-author/meet-the- author-simon-brett "I realised that plot is really important but character and dialogue were actually just as important."https://www.sussexexpress.co.uk/news/people/author-simon-brett- around-115-books-so-far-and-counting-4181431 ==Character== Charles Paris is an unhappily separated (but not divorced, more than 30 years on), moderately successful character actorIn Not Dead, Only Resting (Chapter Seven), Charles Paris is categorized as a character actor by the Spotlight directory. with a slight drinking problem who gets entangled in various crimes, and finds himself unwillingly in the role of amateur detective. Bill Nighy describes Paris as "an actor sleuth, who drinks too much and smokes too much and doesn't work very much. But every time he does go to work, somebody gets murdered." ==Reception== The radio adaptations have been described by The Guardian as "languid, restful fun", and by The Times as "always a treat... Paris is an ingenious confection... The joy for listeners comes from how Nighy makes almost tangible every observation in Front’s pithy script." A review of So Much Blood (2023) in The Daily Telegraph described the series as cozy crime, and wrote "The first reason to tune in is that Charles Paris is Bill Nighy... It's the role he was born to play." The reviewer also praised Suzanne Burden's comic timing.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/radio/what-to-listen-to/bbc- radio-4-charles-paris-mystery-delightful-bill-nighy/ ==Novels== #Cast, In Order of Disappearance (1975) #So Much Blood (1976) #Star Trap (1977) #An Amateur Corpse (1978) #A Comedian Dies (1979) #The Dead Side of the Mic (1980) #Situation Tragedy (1981) #Murder Unprompted (1982) #Murder in the Title (1983) #Not Dead, Only Resting (1984) #Dead Giveaway (1985) #What Bloody Man Is That?

2587146	A Charlie Brown Celebration	A Charlie Brown Celebration is the 23rd prime-time animated television special based upon the popular comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz, and the first hour-long special. It was originally aired on the CBS network on May 24, 1982, and consists of a number of stories adapted from the comic strip. Michael Mandy return to reprise his role for Charlie Brown for the final time as Brad Kesten would take over in Is This Goodbye, Charlie Brown?. The previous actor, Grant Wehr, failed to reprise his role for the character after his sole performance in Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown, as his voice was too coarse by that point. ==Production== The formula used in this special, several stories with one or two-word titles, was later adapted for the Saturday morning CBS series, The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show, which premiered in 1983, and used in another special, It's an Adventure, Charlie Brown. A compilation of short stories also make up You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown (both the stage musical and animated special), Snoopy!!! The Musical (both the stage musical and animated special), and Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales. Schulz first toyed with using vignettes in the 1973 special There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown. There are a number of storylines: *"School": Charlie Brown, Sally Brown, Lucy van Pelt, Linus van Pelt, and Schroeder are going to school. The others are going into third grade, but Sally is going into first grade. *"Kite": Charlie Brown is flying a kite while Snoopy is resting, and Lucy and Linus are talking about Edgar Allan Poe. *"Charlie Brown's School Days": Charlie Brown, Linus, Sally, Peppermint Patty, and Franklin are going to school. *"Sally": Sally, Eudora, and Snoopy are at summer camp. Eudora teases Snoopy. *"Linus and Sally": Linus is reading his report on summer camp. Miss Othmar is horrified by references to queen snakes. Charlie Brown is worried because he studied the wrong chapter, and Sally refuses to draw a cow leg. *"Peppermint Patty": Peppermint Patty is having trouble in school and tries to find a private one to attend instead. Following Snoopy's advice, she goes to the Ace Obedience School and quickly graduates from it, not realizing it is a dog school. The teacher and principal from Peppermint Patty's elementary school do not believe she has already graduated. When she finds out what has happened, she ends up fighting the vicious cat next door, mistaking him for Snoopy. *"Linus": Linus and Sally are going on a field trip. Linus is reunited with Truffles. Sally and Truffles fight over Linus and he gets stuck on a farm roof. It is up to Snoopy and Woodstock to save him. *"Piano": Lucy annoys Schroeder while he is playing his piano. Lucy throws the piano down the sewer. Schroeder tries to get it back with Charlie Brown's help. As Schroeder walks away almost crying, Lucy says that if he were to play it now, he'd strike a "sewer note". She laughs for a while then explains after he loved her, he'd appreciate the humor. When Schroeder tries to call the piano company, a voice commands him to take his time on delivery. *"Lucy": Lucy is very angry and feels she has nothing for which to be thankful. She wants Linus to get logs for the fireplace, playing jokes on him and talking about Abraham Lincoln while he fetches them. *"Peppermint Patty and Marcie": Marcie tries to make some baseball caps for Peppermint Patty's team. *"Charlie Brown": Charlie Brown gets sick and goes to the hospital. Sally takes the opportunity to move into his room but Peppermint Patty, Marcie and Lucy are worried about him. Lucy promises that, if Charlie Brown gets better, she will never pull the football away from him again. Linus tells Charlie Brown's mother about this. When Charlie Brown recovers, Lucy is forced to go through with her promise. However, Charlie Brown misses the ball and kicks Lucy's hand. She says that next time Charlie Brown goes to the hospital, he should stay there ==Voice cast== * Michael Mandy as Charlie Brown * Kristen Fullerton as Lucy van Pelt * Earl Reily as Linus van Pelt * Cindi Reily as Sally Brown * Casey Carlson as Eudora/Truffles * Shannon Cohn as Marcie * Brent Hauer as Peppermint Patty * Christopher Donohoe as Schroeder/Franklin * Bill Melendez as Snoopy/Woodstock ==Production notes== Although Lucy taunts Charlie Brown to kick the football in this special, this is the first time she promises never to pull it away again. When Charlie Brown gets ill at a ball game, Lucy promises never to pull the ball away. She does not pull the ball away when Charlie Brown gets better, but he misses and kicks her arm, resulting in her arm being encased in a cast. Charlie Brown is mentioned as kicking it in the It's Magic, Charlie Brown special. It was the second (and last) episode for Kristen Fullerton as Lucy van Pelt, after when Sydney Penny voiced Lucy in It's Magic, Charlie Brown, Penny decided she would let Fullerton voice Lucy in this episode, she voiced Lucy in Life Is a Circus, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Celebration, in the next special, Fullerton was replaced by Angela Lee. This is the first hour-long animated Peanuts special. ==Stock footage== Scenes from this special recycle footage and ideas from There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown (1973) and Play It Again, Charlie Brown (1971). In The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show episode "Linus' Security Blanket" the scene where Charlie Brown and his kite get stuck in a tree is different, but in You Can't Win, Charlie Brown the scene where Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Lucy and Linus are caught up with his kite on the doghouse is the same. ==Home media== A Charlie Brown Celebration was released on VHS in 1987 by Kartes Communications, And Again in 1995 from Paramount Home Video, and on DVD from Warner Home Video on October 4th, 2016 when it was paired with the 50th anniversary DVD for Charlie Brown's All-Stars. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Peanuts television specials Category:Television shows directed by Bill Melendez Category:1980s American television specials Category:1982 television specials Category:1982 in American television Category:CBS television specials Category:CBS original programming Category:Television shows set in summer camps Category:Television shows written by Charles M.

113226	A Charlie Brown Christmas	A Charlie Brown Christmas is a 1965 animated television special. It is the first TV special based on the comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. Produced by Lee Mendelson and directed by Bill Melendez, the program made its debut on CBS on December 9, 1965. In the special, Charlie Brown finds himself depressed despite the onset of the cheerful holiday season. Lucy suggests he direct a neighborhood Christmas play, but his best efforts are ignored and mocked by his peers when he chooses a real, but puny, Christmas tree as a centerpiece. After the comic strip's debut in 1950, Peanuts had become a phenomenon worldwide by the mid-1960s. The special was commissioned and sponsored by The Coca-Cola Company, and was written over a period of several weeks, and produced on a small budget in six months. In casting the characters, the producers took an unconventional route, hiring child actors. The program's soundtrack was similarly unorthodox, featuring a jazz score by pianist Vince Guaraldi. Its lack of a laugh track (a staple in US television animation in this period), in addition to its tone, pacing, music, and animation, led both the producers and the network to predict the project would be a disaster. However, contrary to their collective apprehension, A Charlie Brown Christmas received high ratings and acclaim from critics. It received an Emmy and a Peabody Award, and became an annual presentation in the United States, airing on broadcast television during the Christmas season for 56 years before becoming exclusively available on Apple TV+ streaming service. Its success paved the way for a series of Peanuts television specials and films. Its jazz soundtrack achieved commercial success, selling five million copies in the US. Live theatrical versions of A Charlie Brown Christmas have been staged. ==Plot== On their way to join their friends ice skating on a frozen pond, Charlie Brown confides in Linus that, despite all the things he likes about the Christmas season, he is still depressed. After Linus' reproach, and a put-down from Violet, he visits Lucy's psychiatric booth and tells her his problem. She suggests that he direct the group's annual Christmas play to get him involved, and he accepts. Charlie Brown becomes even more discouraged by his observations of Christmas' commercialization as he heads for the rehearsal: Lucy laments over not receiving real estate for Christmas; Snoopy decorates his doghouse for a neighborhood lights and display contest; and Charlie Brown's younger sister Sally asks him to write a greedy letter to Santa Claus. At the rehearsal, Charlie Brown finds a play fit for the 1960s with dancing, lively music, an uncooperative cast and a "Christmas Queen" (Lucy). Unable to control the cast, Charlie Brown decides the play needs a more "proper mood", and recommends a Christmas tree; Lucy suggests a big, pink aluminum tree, then sends him and Linus to get one. At the tree lot, Charlie Brown picks the only real tree there, a small sapling. Linus questions his choice, but Charlie Brown believes that once decorated, it will be perfect. When they return, however, Lucy and the others scorn him and the tree and walk away laughing. Crestfallen, Charlie Brown loudly asks if anyone knows what Christmas is all about; Linus says he does, walks to center stage, asks for a spotlight, recites the annunciation to the shepherds, returns and says, "That's what Christmas is all about, Charlie Brown." Realizing that he does not have to let commercialism ruin his own Christmas, Charlie Brown takes the tree home to decorate it and show the others that it will work in the play. He stops at Snoopy's doghouse, which had won the lights and display contest, and hangs a large red Christmas ball on his tree. The ornament's weight causes the tiny tree to bend to the ground. Believing he has killed the tree, Charlie Brown, dejected, walks away. The others realize that they were too hard on Charlie Brown and quietly follow him. As they all start to see its potential, Linus gently uprights the drooping tree and wraps his blanket around its base to give it some support. After the others give the tree a makeover using more decorations from the doghouse, even Lucy concedes to Charlie Brown's choice. The kids then start humming "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". Hearing them, Charlie Brown returns to see that the sapling is now a magnificent Christmas tree. All the kids shout, "Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!", and then sing "Hark" with Charlie Brown joining in as snow begins to fall. == Cast == * Peter Robbins as Charlie Brown * Christopher Shea as Linus van Pelt * Tracy Stratford as Lucille "Lucy" van Pelt * Cathy Steinberg as Sally Brown * Chris Doran as Schroeder and Shermy * Geoffrey Orstein as Pig-Pen * Sally Dryer as Violet * Anne Altieri as Frieda * Bill Melendez as Snoopy * Karen Mendelson as Patty * Choral vocals: Members of the children's choir of St. Paul's Episcopal Church (San Rafael, California) directed by Robert “Barry” Mineah. The choir was recognized for their contribution to this work at a 40-year anniversary at the Schulz Museum in Santa Rosa. The choir was also featured on the Vince Guaraldi recording At Grace Cathedral. == Production == === Development === By the early 1960s, Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts had gained enormous popularity. Television producer Lee Mendelson acknowledged the strip's cultural impression and had an idea for a documentary on its success, phoning Schulz to propose the idea. Schulz, an avid baseball fan, recognized Mendelson from his documentary on ballplayer Willie Mays, A Man Named Mays, and invited him to his home in Sebastopol, California, to discuss the project. Their meeting was cordial, with the plan to produce a half-hour documentary set. Mendelson wanted to feature roughly "one or two" minutes of animation, and Schulz suggested animator Bill Melendez, with whom he collaborated some years before on a spot for the Ford Motor Company. Mendelson later stated that he was drawn to doing an animated Charlie Brown after working on A Man Named Mays, noting that Mays was arguably the best baseball player of all time, while Charlie Brown, in a running gag in the strips, was one of the worst, making him a natural follow-up subject to his previous work. Despite the popularity of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special. By April 1965, Time featured the Peanuts gang on its magazine cover, perhaps prompting a call from John Allen of the New York- based McCann Erickson Agency. Mendelson imagined he would sell his documentary, and blindly agreed to Allen's proposal: an animated half-hour Peanuts Christmas special. The Coca-Cola Company was looking for a special to sponsor during the holiday season. "The bad news is that today is Wednesday and they'll need an outline in Atlanta by Monday," Allen remarked to Mendelson. He quickly contacted Schulz, and the two got to work with plans for a Peanuts Christmas special. The duo prepared an outline for the Coca-Cola executives in less than one day, and Mendelson would later recall that the bulk of ideas came from Schulz, whose "ideas flowed nonstop." According to Mendelson, their pitch to Coca-Cola consisted of "winter scenes, a school play, a scene to be read from the Bible, and a sound track combining jazz and traditional music." The outline did not change over the course of its production. As Allen was in Europe, the duo received no feedback on their pitch for several days. When Allen got in touch with them, he informed them that Coca-Cola wanted to buy the special, but also wanted it for an early December broadcast, giving the duo just six months to scramble together a team to produce the special. Mendelson assured him – without complete confidence in his statements – that this would be no problem. Following this, A Charlie Brown Christmas entered production. === Writing === Schulz's main goal for a Peanuts-based Christmas special was to focus on the true meaning of Christmas. He desired to juxtapose this theme with interspersed shots of snow and ice- skating, perhaps inspired by his own childhood growing up in St. Paul, Minnesota. He also created the idea for the school play, and mixing jazz with traditional Christmas carols. Schulz was adamant about Linus' reading of the Bible, despite Mendelson and Melendez's concerns that religion was a controversial topic, especially on television. Melendez recalled Schulz turned to him and remarked, "If we don't do it, who will?". Schulz's estimation proved accurate, and in the 1960s, fewer than nine percent of television Christmas episodes contained a substantive reference to religion, according to university researcher Stephen Lind.Lind, Stephen J. "Christmas in the 1960s: A Charlie Brown Christmas, Religion, and the Conventions of the Genre" Journal of Religion and Popular Culture 26.1 (2014) Schulz's faith in the Bible stemmed from his Midwest background and religious and historical studies; as such, aspects of religion would be a topic of study throughout his life.Templeton, David. My Lunch with Sparky, reproduced from the December 30, 1999 – January 5, 2000 issue of the Sonoma County Independent. Archived November 28, 2008. According to a 2015 "spiritual biography", Schulz's religion was personal and complex, and would be integrated in a number of his programs.Lind, Stephen J. "A Charlie Brown Religion: The Spiritual Life and Work of Charles M. Schulz" (Jackson: U P Mississippi, 2015) The program's script has been described as "barebones", and was completed in only a few weeks. In the days following the special's sell to Coca-Cola, Mendelson and animator Bill Melendez met with Schulz in his home to expand upon the ideas promised in the pitch. Mendelson remembered that on the previous Christmas Day he and his spouse had read Hans Christian Andersen's "The Fir-Tree" to their children. Schulz countered with the idea that there be a tree with the spirit of lead character Charlie Brown. They spoke at length about creating an official theme that was neither jazz nor traditional to open the program. Schulz wanted a part of the special to feature the character of Schroeder performing Beethoven, and Mendelson combined this with the inclusion of Vince Guaraldi's "Linus and Lucy" number. Schulz penned the script for A Charlie Brown Christmas, with Melendez plotting out the animation via a storyboard. His storyboard contained six panels for each shot, spanning a combined eighty or-so pages. Mendelson also suggested they employ a laugh track, a staple of television animation, but Schulz rejected this idea immediately. "Up until then, many, if not all, animated shows had laugh tracks," said Mendelson. "As we were discussing how we would handle our special, I said very casually, 'I assume we'll have a laugh track.' It was a statement, not a question. Sparky just got up and quietly walked out of the room. We looked at each other, then Bill said, 'Well, I guess we won't have a laugh track.' Sparky came back in the room, and we went on with the meeting as if the subject had never come up." Schulz felt strongly that the audience at home should not be instructed when to laugh. === Casting === In casting the silent comic strip characters of Peanuts, the trio pulled from their personalities. Lead character Charlie Brown's voice was decided to be downbeat and nondescript ("blah," as Mendelson observed), while Lucy be bold and forthright. Linus' voice, it was decided, would combine both sophistication with childlike innocence. Mendelson recognized that the character of Snoopy was the strip's most popular character who seemed to seize "the best jokes," but realized they could not cast a voice for the cartoon dog. "In the process, we gained a veritable 'canine Harpo Marx,'" Mendelson later wrote. Melendez suggested he provide gibberish for Snoopy's mutterings, and simply speed up the tape to prevent viewers from knowing. There are no adult characters in the strip or in this special. Later specials would introduce an offscreen teacher; her lines are eschewed for the sound of a muted trombone (suggested by Guaraldi) as the team behind the specials found it humorous. With this in mind, the trio set out to cast the characters, which proved to be a daunting process. Casting for Charlie Brown proved most difficult, as it required both good acting skills but also the ability to appear nonchalant. The producers picked eight-year-old Peter Robbins, already known for his roles spanning television, film, and advertisements. Robbins considered Charlie Brown to be one of his favorite characters, and despite leaving acting as an adult, he considered his time in the role a highlight of his life. His godmother, Hollywood agent Hazel McMillen, discovered Christopher Shea, who would become Linus in the special. His slight lisp, according to Mendelson, gave him a "youthful sweetness," while his emotional script reading "gave him power and authority as well." Tracy Stratford played the role of Lucy, with the creators being impressed by her attitude and professionalism. Kathy Steinberg was the youngest of the performers, just six years old at the time of recording. Too young to read, the producers had to give her one line at a time to recite. Robbins remembered Melendez did this for him as well, joking that he also mistakenly copied his Latino accent. Mendelson desired to have non-actors (not "Hollywood kids") perform on the special, and he sent tape recorders home with his employees for their children to audition. Much of the background cast came from Mendelson's home neighborhood in northern California. According to Robbins, the children viewed the script's sophisticated dialogue as "edgy," finding several words and phrases, among them "eastern syndicate", difficult to pronounce. He recalled the recording sessions as chaotic, with excited children running rampant. Nevertheless, the recording of A Charlie Brown Christmas was completed in one day. Jefferson Airplane was recording next door and came over to obtain the children's autographs. Following the special's broadcast, the children became wildly popular in their respective elementary schools; Robbins recalled groups approaching him asking him to recite lines of dialogue. === Animation === Animation for A Charlie Brown Christmas was created by Bill Melendez Productions. Mendelson had no idea whether or not completing a half- hour's worth of animation would be possible given the production's six-month schedule, but Melendez confirmed its feasibility. In actuality, animation was only completed in the final four months of production. CBS initially wanted an hour's worth of animation, but Melendez talked them down to a half-hour special, believing an hour of television animation was too much. Having never worked on a half-hour special before, Melendez phoned Bill Hanna of Hanna- Barbera for advice, but Hanna declined to give any. CBS gave a budget of $76,000 to produce the show and it went $20,000 over budget. The first step in creating the animation was to make a pencil drawing, afterwards inking and painting the drawing onto a cel. The cel was then placed onto a painted background. There are 13,000 drawings in the special, with 12 frames per second to create the illusion of movement. Melendez had previously worked for Warner Bros. and Disney, and working on Peanuts-related material gave him a chance to animate a truly flat cartoon design. The movement of Schulz's characters, particularly the Peanuts gang, was limited. The character of Snoopy, however, proved the exception to the rule. "He can do anything – move and dance – and he's very easy to animate," said Melendez. == Soundtrack == The soundtrack to A Charlie Brown Christmas is an unorthodox mix of traditional Christmas music and jazz. The jazz portions were created by the Vince Guaraldi Trio. Producer Lee Mendelson, a fan of jazz, heard Guaraldi's crossover hit "Cast Your Fate to the Wind" on the radio not long after completion of his documentary Charlie Brown & Charles Schulz, and contacted the musician to produce music for the special. Guaraldi composed the music for the project, creating an entire piece, "Linus and Lucy," to serve as the theme. When Coca-Cola commissioned A Charlie Brown Christmas in spring 1965, Guaraldi returned to write the music. The first instrumentals for the special were recorded by Guaraldi at Glendale, California's Whitney Studio with bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Colin Bailey. Recycling "Linus and Lucy" from the earlier special, Guaraldi completed two new originals for the special, "Skating", and "Christmas Time Is Here". In the weeks preceding the premiere, Mendelson encountered trouble finding a lyricist for Guaraldi's instrumental intro, and penned "Christmas Time is Here" in "about 15 minutes" on the backside of an envelope. The special opens and closes with a choir of children, culled from St. Paul's Episcopal Church in San Rafael, California, performing "Christmas Time Is Here" and "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing". One of the singers, Candace Hackett Shively, went on to become an elementary school teacher, and sent a letter of gratitude to Schulz after he announced his retirement in 2000. In the letter, she recalls recording the choir at Fantasy Studios and going out for ice cream afterwards, while also saying she tells the story to her grade-schoolers each holiday season. The recording sessions were conducted in late autumn 1965 and were cut in three separate sessions over two weeks. They often ran late into the night, resulting in angry parents, some who forbade their children from returning; consequently, numerous new children were present at each session. The children were directed by Barry Mineah, who demanded perfection from the choir. Mendelson and Guaraldi disagreed, desiring the "kids to sound like kids"; they used a slightly off-key version of "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing" in the final cut. Children were paid five dollars for their participation. In addition, the children recorded dialogue for the special's final scene, in which the crowd of kids shout "Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!" The soundtrack for the special was recorded during these sessions, with decisions regarding timing and phrasing determined quickly. Guaraldi brought in bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli to record the music, and spent time later re-recording earlier tracks, including covers of "The Christmas Song" and "Greensleeves." The eventual LP release credited Guaraldi solely, neglecting to mention the other musicians; Guaraldi was notorious for never keeping records of his session players. Nearly three decades later, in an effort to resolve the matter, Fantasy surmised that the recordings with Budwig and Bailey were employed in the special, while Marshall and Granelli recorded the album. Despite this, other individuals have come forward claiming to have recorded the special's music: bassists Eugene Firth and Al Obidinski, and drummers Paul Distel and Benny Barth. Firth and Distil are listed as performers on a studio- session report Guaraldi filed for the American Federation of Musicians. A Charlie Brown Christmas was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007, and added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry list of "culturally, historically, or aesthetically important" American sound recordings in 2012. "I have always felt that one of the key elements that made that show was the music," said Mendelson in 2010. "It gave it a contemporary sound that appealed to all ages. Although Vince had never scored anything else and although I was basically a documentary film maker at the time, we started to work together on the cues because we both loved jazz and we both played the piano. So he would bring in the material for each scene and we would go over it scene by scene. Most of the time, the music worked perfectly. But there were times we would either not use something or use it somewhere else. We went through this same process on all sixteen shows. Although there was always some left over music, most of the time what he wrote and performed is what went on the air." == Reception == A Charlie Brown Christmas was completed just ten days shy of its national broadcast premiere. All involved believed the special would be a disaster. Melendez first saw the completed animation at a showing in a theater in the days before its premiere, turning to his crew of animators and remarking, "My golly, we've killed it." Melendez was embarrassed, but one of the animators, Ed Levitt, was more positive regarding the special, telling him it was "the best special [he'll] ever make [...] This show is going to run for a hundred years." Mendelson was similar in his assumptions of the show's quality, and when he showed the film to network executives in New York, their opinions were also negative. Their complaints included the show's slow pace, the music not fitting, and the animation too simple. "I really believed, if it hadn't been scheduled for the following week, there's no way they were gonna broadcast that show," Mendelson later said. Executives had invited television critic Richard Burgheim of Time to view the special, and debated as to whether showing it to him would be a good idea. His review, printed the following week, was positive, praising the special as unpretentious and writing that "A Charlie Brown Christmas is one children's special this season that bears repeating." The program premiered on CBS on December 9, 1965, at 7:30 pm ET (pre-empting The Munsters), and was viewed by 45% of those watching television that evening, with the number of homes watching the special an estimated 15,490,000, placing it at number two in the ratings, behind Bonanza on NBC. The special received critical acclaim: The Hollywood Reporter deemed the show "delightfully novel and amusing," while the Weekly Variety dubbed it "fascinating and haunting." Bob Williams of the New York Post praised the "very neat transition from comic page to screen," while Lawrence Laurent of The Washington Post declared that "natural-born loser Charlie Brown finally turned up a real winner last night." Harriet Van Horne of the New York World- Telegram hailed the scene in which Linus recites scripture, commenting, "Linus' reading of the story of the Nativity was, quite simply, the dramatic highlight of the season." Harry Harris of The Philadelphia Inquirer called the program "a yule classic [...] generated quiet warmth and amusement," and Terrence O'Flaherty of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, "Charlie Brown was a gem of a television show." Ben Gross of the New York Daily News praised the special's "charm and good taste," while Rick DuBrow of United Press International predicted, "the Peanuts characters last night staked out a claim to a major television future." The film has an aggregated review score of 85% based on 20 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. The show's positive reviews were highlighted with an ad in trade magazines; one thanked Coca-Cola, CBS, United Features Syndicate, and the show's viewers. Fantasy released the special's soundtrack the first week of December 1965, coinciding with the special's airdate. United Feature Syndicate pushed hard to promote the special, while Word Publishing issued a hardcover adaption of the special. CBS promptly ordered four additional Peanuts specials. A Charlie Brown Christmas was awarded the Emmy Award for Outstanding Children's Program in 1966, making it the second animated TV program to win that award after Hanna-Barbera's The Huckleberry Hound Show. "Charlie Brown is not used to winning, so we thank you," Schulz joked. In 2022, an internal poll of writers at Fatherly ranked the special at 62 in a list of the 100 greatest family-friendly films of all time, one of only two productions made specifically for television to make the list (the other being the 1966 version of How the Grinch Stole Christmas!). In its summary, the writers noted that the special's technical flaws "are what makes A Charlie Brown Christmas feel distinct and special rather than generic" and that its low-budget feel fit the theme of the story.

The original broadcasts included references to the sponsor, Coca-Cola. Because of Dolly Madison's eventual co-sponsorship of the series, as well as subsequent FCC laws mandating the separation of commercial material from the actual program material, subsequent broadcasts and home media releases removed all references to Coca-Cola products. Broadcasts of the special in later years also had some scenes, animation, including sound effects being redone for correction. Snoopy's dog bowl was repainted red instead of white, Lucy now makes a whirling noise when scared out of her psychiatric booth, new animation was placed in scenes where the children dance on stage after the first time to avoid repetition, music was added in the background of the rehearsal scenes, and Snoopy no longer sings like a human in the final carol, amongst others. Removed from some subsequent broadcasts is a scene in which Linus throws a snowball at a tin can using his blanket. For several years it was rumored the can was a Coca-Cola can. However, a recently obtained copy of the original print disproves this rumor, showing the can was always a generic tin can. ===ABC=== Beginning with the 2001 holiday season, ABC held rights to the special. On December 6, 2001, a half-hour documentary on the special titled The Making of 'A Charlie Brown Christmas' (hosted by Whoopi Goldberg) aired on ABC. This documentary has been released as a special feature on the DVD and Blu-ray editions of the special. In subsequent years, to allow the special in an hour timeslot to be broadcast uncut for time, the animated vignette collection, Charlie Brown's Christmas Tales, is broadcast in the remaining time for that hour. The show's 40th anniversary broadcast on December 6, 2005, had the highest ratings in its time slot. The 50th anniversary broadcast aired on November 30, 2015, and it featured a full two-hour time slot that was padded by a special, It's Your 50th Christmas, Charlie Brown, which was hosted by Kristen Bell, and featured musical performances by Kristin Chenoweth, Matthew Morrison, Sarah McLachlan, Boyz II Men, Pentatonix, David Benoit, and the All-American Boys Chorus. It also included documentary features.ABC announces 2015 holiday programming schedule . Moviefone. Retrieved October 27, 2015. After 18 consecutive years of being broadcast on the network, the special aired on ABC for the last time on December 17, 2019, at 8pm ET/PT. ===Apple TV+=== In October 2020, Apple TV+ acquired exclusive rights to all Peanuts-related media. Under the terms of the agreement, Apple TV+ must make A Charlie Brown Christmas and two other holiday specials (It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown and A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving) available for free on the platform during a three-day window. The window for A Charlie Brown Christmas was from December 11 to 13, 2020. In 2022 it was from December 22 through December 25; subscribers to Apple TV+ have a broader window to watch the specials. ===PBS=== After mounting criticism over Apple's decision to remove the Peanuts specials from free television, the company announced a deal with PBS to resume the annual broadcast tradition. In accordance with most PBS member stations' non-commercial educational licenses, the special was presented on PBS without commercial interruption, with an underwriting message from Apple being the only advertising. PBS, Apple and WildBrain, the rightsholder to the Peanuts television library, announced they had renewed the arrangement in October 2021. PBS did not acquire the broadcast rights for the Peanuts specials in 2022, ending a 57 year run on broadcast television. ==Home media== In 1985, the special was released on VHS and Betamax by Media Home Entertainment, along with You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown. In 1987 the special was released on VHS by its kids subsidiary, Hi-Tops Video. In 1991, the special was released for a limited time on VHS through Shell Oil for sale at their gas stations. On September 28, 1994, the special was released by Paramount on VHS. A laserdisc was released by Paramount (distributed by Pioneer) in 1996; Side 2 contained the 1979 special You're the Greatest, Charlie Brown. In September 2000 it was released on DVD. Bonus features included the 1992 special It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown. On September 23, 2008, Warner Home Video (to which the rights to the Peanuts specials reverted earlier in the year, due to Melendez's connections to WB) released a "remastered" DVD. Bonus features include a restored version of Christmastime Again and a new documentary titled "A Christmas Miracle: The Making of A Charlie Brown Christmas". On October 6, 2009, it was released in high definition Blu-ray Disc from Warner in remastered Dolby 5.1 surround sound. This disc also contains It's Christmastime Again, A Christmas Miracle, a DVD of the special, and a Digital Copy. Since off-network rights to this special have been transferred to Warner Bros., it has become available as a download on the iTunes Store, PlayStation Network, Amazon Instant Video, and Google Play, and includes It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown and It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown. In December 2014, a 50th anniversary 2-DVD set was released. It also features the special It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown, and the Making of... documentary from previous editions. On October 31, 2017, it was released on 4K UHD Blu-ray disc containing It's Christmastime Again, Charlie Brown and the Making of... special. == Legacy == A Charlie Brown Christmas has become a Christmas staple in the United States. Within the scope of future Peanuts specials, it established their style, combining thoughtful themes, jazzy scores, and simple animation. It also, according to author Charles Solomon, established the half-hour animated special as a television tradition, inspiring the creation of numerous others, including How the Grinch Stole Christmas! (1966) and Frosty the Snowman (1969). (Earlier animated specials such as Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol and Rudolph the Red- Nosed Reindeer ran a full hour.) USA Today summarized the program's appeal upon its 40th anniversary in 2005: "Scholars of pop culture say that shining through the program's skeletal plot is the quirky and sophisticated genius that fueled the phenomenal popularity of Schulz's work." Beyond its references to religion, unheard of on television at the time, the special also marked the first time children voiced animated characters. The special influenced dozens of young aspiring artists and animators, many of whom went on to work within both the comics and animation industries, among them Eric Goldberg (Pocahontas), Pete Docter (Monsters, Inc., Up), Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo, WALL-E), Jef Mallett (Frazz), and Patrick McDonnell (Mutts). The show's score made an equally pervasive impact on viewers who would later perform jazz, among them David Benoit and George Winston. More directly, the special launched a series of Peanuts films, TV specials (many of them holiday-themed) and other works of entertainment. Linus' speech near the end of the special was used in the Sidewalk Prophets Christmas song "What a Glorious Night". == Stage adaptation == In 2013, Tams-Witmark Music Library, Inc. began licensing an official stage version of the television special authorized by the Schulz family and Lee Mendelson. The stage version follows the television special but includes an optional sing-along section of Christmas songs at the end. It includes all of Vince Guaraldi's music from the television special and the television script is adapted for the stage by Eric Schaeffer. It has been performed at hundreds of schools, churches and community theatres. ==Tree (The Charlie Brown Christmas Tree)== thumb|right|Charlie Brown (left) and Linus (right) with the Charlie Brown Christmas Tree The popularity of the special practically eliminated the popularity of the aluminum Christmas tree, which was a fad from 1958 to 1965, when the special portrayed it negatively.

1256956	A Charlie Brown Christmas (soundtrack)	A Charlie Brown Christmas is the eighth studio album by American jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi (later credited to the Vince Guaraldi Trio). The album was released in December 1965 in the U.S. by Fantasy Records and was Guaraldi's final studio album for the label. It is the soundtrack to the Christmas television special of the same name. Guaraldi was contacted by television producer Lee Mendelson to compose music for a documentary on the comic strip Peanuts and its creator, Charles M. Schulz. Although the special went unaired, these selections were released in 1964 as Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown. Coca-Cola commissioned a Christmas special based on Peanuts in 1965 and Guaraldi returned to score the special. Guaraldi composed most of the music, though he included versions of traditional carols such as "O Tannenbaum". He recorded some of the score at Whitney Studio in Glendale, California, then re-recorded some of it at Fantasy Records Studios in San Francisco with a children's choir from St. Paul's Episcopal Church in nearby San Rafael. The sessions ran late into the night, with the children rewarded with ice cream afterward. Bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli were credited as performing on the album. It was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress. In 1988, Fantasy Records re-released a CD of the 11 original tracks plus one bonus cut, "Greensleeves." a 16-track remastered version was released in 2006, followed by a second remastered in 2012. In 2022, Craft Recordings embarked on a major reissue campaign in a variety of expanded, deluxe editions. These sets feature a new stereo mix completed by Paul Blakemore, the original 1965 stereo mix, and up to 50 previously unreleased outtakes from five separate recording sessions. The three editions are a single LP vinyl edition, comprising the original 1965 stereo release offered in gold foil sleeved with embossing details (released September 22, 2022); two-disc LP vinyl and CD expanded editions, containing the 2022 stereo mix and 13 outtakes from the original recording sessions (released December 2, 2022); and a five-disc super deluxe edition, which adds three CDs of complete Autumn 1965 recording sessions and a Blu-ray audio disc containing high-resolution audio and Dolby Atmos mixes (released December 2, 2022). On May 10, 2022, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album quintuple platinum for sales of 5 million copies. In November 2014, it was the 10th best-selling Christmas/holiday album in the United States during the SoundScan era. ==Background== By the early 1960s, Charles M. Schulz's comic strip Peanuts had become a sensation worldwide. Television producer Lee Mendelson acknowledged the strip's cultural impression and produced a documentary on the subject, titled A Boy Named Charlie Brown. Mendelson, a fan of jazz, heard Vince Guaraldi's song "Cast Your Fate to the Wind" on the radio not long after completion of his documentary, and contacted the musician to produce music for the special. Guaraldi composed the music for the project, creating an entire piece, "Linus and Lucy", to serve as the theme. Despite the popularity of the strip and acclaim from advertisers, networks were not interested in the special. By April 1965, Time featured the Peanuts gang on its magazine cover, and plans for an animated half-hour Peanuts Christmas TV special were commissioned by The Coca-Cola Company. When Coca-Cola commissioned the A Charlie Brown Christmas TV special in spring 1965, Guaraldi returned to write the music, having just recorded the live album At Grace Cathedral at San Francisco's famed cathedral with St. Paul's Church of San Rafael 68-voice choir. ==Recording and production== The first instrumentals for the special were recorded by Guaraldi at Glendale, California's Whitney Studio with bassist Monty Budwig and drummer Colin Bailey on March 6, 1965. Recycling "Linus and Lucy" from the earlier special and the album Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown, Guaraldi completed two new originals, "Skating", and "Christmas Time Is Here". In the weeks preceding the premiere, Mendelson encountered trouble finding a lyricist for Guaraldi's instrumental intro and wrote "Christmas Time Is Here" in "about 15 minutes" on the back of an envelope. The special begins and ends with a children's choir from St. Paul's Episcopal Church in San Rafael performing "Christmas Time Is Here" and "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing",. Guaraldi had performed with the choir at his May 1965 "jazz mass" performance at Grace Cathedral (released in September 1965 as At Grace Cathedral). The recording sessions were conducted in late autumn 1965 in three sessions over two weeks. They often ran late into the night, resulting in angry parents, some who forbade their children to return; as a result, numerous new children were present at each session. The children were directed by Barry Mineah, who demanded perfection from the choir. Mendelson and Guaraldi disagreed, wanting "kids to sound like kids"; they used a slightly off-key version of "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing" in the final cut. Children were paid five dollars for their participation. In addition, the children recorded dialogue for the special's final scene in which the crowd of kids shout "Merry Christmas, Charlie Brown!" One of the singers, Candace Hackett Shively, became an elementary school teacher and sent a letter of gratitude to Schulz after he announced his retirement in 2000. In the letter, she recalls recording the choir at Fantasy Studios and going out for ice cream afterwards, while noting that she tells the story to her students every holiday season. Guaraldi brought in bassist Fred Marshall and drummer Jerry Granelli and re-recorded tracks such as "The Christmas Song" and "Greensleeves". The album credited Guaraldi solely, neglecting to mention the other musicians; Guaraldi was notorious for never keeping records of his session players. Nearly three decades later, in an effort to correct the matter, Fantasy surmised that the recordings with Budwig and Bailey were employed in the television special while Marshall and Granelli recorded the album. Despite this, other musicians have claimed to have recorded the special's music: bassists Eugene Firth and Al Obidinski and drummers Paul Distel and Benny Barth. Firth and Distil are noted as performers on a studio- session report Guaraldi filed for the American Federation of Musicians. Not all music featured in the current version of the holiday special was released on the soundtrack. After the inaugural broadcast of the special in December 1965, Lee Mendelson and Bill Melendez fitted several scenes with the songs "Charlie Brown Theme," "Happiness Theme" and "Frieda (with the Naturally Curly Hair)", all lifted from Jazz Impressions of A Boy Named Charlie Brown. In addition, "Air Music" (aka "Surfin' Snoopy") from the soundtrack of Charlie Brown's All Stars! was inserted in the scene where Snoopy is decorating his doghouse with Christmas ornaments. These four additional songs were not included in the soundtrack release as they were not part of the original show. Additionally, tracks "What Child Is This" and "The Christmas Song" are on this recording, but were not included in the special. ==Reception== ===Commercial performance=== On May 10, 2022, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album quintuple platinum for sales of 5 million copies, making it the second-best-selling jazz album in history, behind Miles Davis’ Kind of Blue (1959). A Charlie Brown Christmas first appeared on a Billboard magazine music sales chart on the week of December 19, 1987, when it debuted and peaked at No. 13 on the Billboard Christmas Albums sales chart. The album charted on the Billboard Christmas Albums chart every Christmas/holiday season from 1988 through 2003, peaking as high as No. 8 in both 2001 and 2002. The album also charted on the Billboard Top Pop Catalog Albums chart during the Christmas/holiday season every year from 1991 through 2003, peaking as high as No. 6 in 2001. It became the first jazz soundtrack album to reach the Top 10 outside of a specialty album chart (i.e. Christmas Albums, Top Pop Catalog Albums, Kids Albums) when, in January 2021, it reached No. 10 in the Billboard 200 chart. Derrick Bang, Guaraldi historian and author of Vince Guaraldi at the Piano, noted the significance of such a "huge" accomplishment, with Guaraldi sharing top spots with Taylor Swift, Paul McCartney and Eminem. In November 2014, it was the 10th best-selling Christmas/holiday album in the United States during the SoundScan era. A Charlie Brown Christmas was also the 10th best-selling holiday album of 2011, a year that marked the sixth time since 2001 that the album had ranked among the year's top 10 Christmas albums. It was also the ninth best-selling album of 2013. On November 18, 2021, it was ranked as the No. 1 Greatest Holiday 200 album of All Time by Billboard. ===Critical reception=== Allmusic reviewer Shawn M. Haney called it "joyous and festive meditation for the holiday season" writing, "Guaraldi strings together elegant, enticing arrangements that reflect the spirit and mood of Schulz's work." Dominique Leone at Pitchfork called the songs "small, observant miracles...If there's a muted quality to a lot of this music, it's smiling nonetheless." The soundtrack to A Charlie Brown Christmas has been considered "one of the most beloved holiday albums recorded." Chris Barton of the Los Angeles Times asserts that the soundtrack introduced jazz to an entirely new generation, having been heard by more individuals than the work of the genre's most influential players, including Miles Davis and John Coltrane. The score influenced dozens of young aspiring musicians, among them David Benoit and George Winston. Haney wrote that the record "introduce[d] contemporary jazz to youngsters with grace, charm, and creativity." In 2019, it was ranked the fourth greatest Christmas album of all time by Rolling Stone. A Charlie Brown Christmas was voted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2007. In 2012 the album was added to the Library of Congress's National Recording Registry for being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant". ==Track listing== Side one # "O Tannenbaum" (Ernst Anschütz) – 5:08 # "What Child Is This" (William Chatterton Dix) – 2:25 # "My Little Drum" (Vince Guaraldi) – 3:12 # "Linus and Lucy" (Guaraldi) – 3:06 # "Christmas Time Is Here (instrumental)" (Guaraldi) – 6:05 Side two # "Christmas Time Is Here (vocal)" (Guaraldi, Lee Mendelson) – 2:47 # "Skating" (Guaraldi) – 2:27 # "Hark, the Herald Angels Sing" (Charles Wesley) – 1:55 # "Christmas Is Coming" (Guaraldi) – 3:25 # "Fur Elise" (Ludwig van Beethoven) – 1:06 # "The Christmas Song" (Mel Tormé, Robert Wells) – 3:17 Bonus track – 1988 onwards # * "Greensleeves" (traditional) – 5:25 Note: "Greensleeves" is actually the original title of the tune used for "What Child is This". ==="A Charlie Brown Christmas" Featuring The Famous Peanuts Characters=== 2016 CD track list # "O Tannenbaum" # "What Child Is This" # "My Little Drum" # "Linus And Lucy" # "Christmas Time Is Here" (Instrumental) # "Christmas Time Is Here" (Vocal) # "Skating" # "Hark, The Herald Angels Sing" # "Christmas Is Coming" # "Für Elise" # "The Christmas Song" # "Greensleeves" (Original CD Bonus track) # "Christmas Is Coming" (Alternate Take 1)(2006 Bonus track) # "The Christmas Song" (Alternate Take 3)(2006 Bonus track) # "Greensleeves" (Alternate Take 6)(2006 Bonus track) # "Christmas Time Is Here" (Alternate Vocal Take)(2006 Bonus track) ==Personnel== Vince Guaraldi Trio * Vince Guaraldi – piano, bandleader, Hammond organ on "Hark, The Herald Angels Sing" * Fred Marshall – double bass * Monty Budwig – double bass ("Linus and Lucy", "Greensleeves") * Jerry Granelli – drums * Colin Bailey – drums ("Linus and Lucy", "Greensleeves") Children's chorus for the songs "Christmas Time Is Here", "Hark, The Herald Angels Sing" and when the kids all shout "Merry Christmas Charlie Brown" was the Children's choir of St. Paul's Episcopal Church in San Rafael, California.

1293054	A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving	A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving is the tenth prime-time animated television special based upon the popular comic strip Peanuts, by Charles M. Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on November 20, 1973, and won an Emmy Award the following year. It was the third holiday special after A Charlie Brown Christmas in 1965 and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown in 1966. ==Plot== In a cold open cameo, Lucy entices Charlie Brown to kick her football, calling it a Thanksgiving tradition; she pulls the ball away as usual, stating that some traditions fade away. The Browns are preparing to go to their grandmother's for Thanksgiving dinner when Charlie Brown gets a phone call from Peppermint Patty, who is alone for Thanksgiving and wants to come over for dinner. Two quick subsequent phone calls from Peppermint Patty add Marcie and Franklin to the guest list for a dinner. Linus suggests to a perplexed Charlie Brown that he could have two Thanksgiving dinners; the first Thanksgiving feast can be for himself, Peppermint Patty and the others, while the second one can be at his grandparents' house for his family. Linus recruits Snoopy and Woodstock to help; Snoopy sets up a ping pong table and chairs. Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock and Linus then prepare a feast of toast, pan-fried popcorn, pretzel sticks, and jelly beans. The guests arrive and make their way to the backyard for the Thanksgiving feast. Linus leads the group in prayer that details the First Thanksgiving in 1621, and then Snoopy serves up the feast. While Charlie Brown happily munches, Peppermint Patty scowls about the food. Peppermint Patty's initial shock at the unconventional meal quickly turns to outrage and complains to Charlie Brown, who dejectedly leaves the table. Marcie then asks her whether Charlie Brown invited her or if she just invited herself. Coming to her senses, Peppermint Patty asks Marcie to apologize to Charlie Brown on her behalf (unintentionally paralleling The Courtship of Miles Standish); Marcie reluctantly agrees, but Peppermint Patty soon follows and apologizes to him herself. Following this, Charlie Brown is reminded that he and Sally are due at their grandmother's house for dinner, so he calls her and explains his situation. When he mentions his friends are there, his grandmother invites them all to Thanksgiving dinner, much to the group's elation. As they all pile into the car to go to the Browns' grandmother's, they sing "Over the River and Through the Wood", to which Charlie Brown notes his grandmother lives in a condominium. Snoopy and Woodstock go to the doghouse and cook up their own traditional Thanksgiving meal. They then break the wishbone, which Woodstock wins. Over the end credits, the two enjoy some pumpkin pie. ==Broadcast history== The special first aired on CBS on November 20, 1973, and continued to air every year on that network (skipping 1982, 1983, and 1988) until November 23, 1989. The Disney Channel and Nickelodeon returned the special for re-airing in the 1990s (in the latter channel's case, under the "You're on Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown" umbrella of Peanuts productions) and then, in 2001, it moved, along with the rest of the Peanuts specials, to ABC. In contrast to CBS, ABC aired the special every year through 2019, on several days in the week leading up to Thanksgiving, and it had regularly won its time slot.TV Ratings Wednesday: ‘A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving’ wins the night, ‘Survivor’ dips. TV by the Numbers (November 28, 2019). Retrieved November 30, 2019. As the special runs slightly over a half-hour with commercials, ABC typically filled the remaining portion of the full hour with other Peanuts programming. From 2008 to 2019, the remaining time was filled by a slightly abridged edit of "The Mayflower Voyagers," the premiere episode of the 1988 miniseries This Is America, Charlie Brown. Starting in 2020, the special (along with the rest of the Peanuts library) will exclusively air on Apple TV+; under the terms of the agreement, Apple TV+ must provide a three-day window in November in which the special is available for free. On November 18, 2020 Apple announced they had reached an agreement to air the special on Sunday, November 22, 2020, the Sunday before Thanksgiving, commercial free on PBS and PBS Kids. In accordance with most PBS affiliates' non-commercial educational licenses, the special was presented on PBS unedited without commercial interruption, with only a brief underwriting spot before and after the special: "This special broadcast of A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving was made possible by Apple." Apple renewed the agreement with PBS in 2021 but did not renew it for 2022. It is also broadcast in Canada, usually in early October in line with the Canadian observance of Thanksgiving. The special is aired on Family Channel as of 2018, with the special aired on the day before Thanksgiving and on Thanksgiving Day, which takes place on the second Monday of October in Canada. ==Voice actors== * Todd Barbee as Charlie Brown ** Peter Robbins as Charlie Brown's screaming voice (archived) * Robin Kohn as Lucy van Pelt * Stephen Shea as Linus van Pelt * Hilary Momberger as Sally Brown * Christopher DeFaria as Patricia "Peppermint Patty" Reichardt * Jimmy Ahrens as Marcie * Robin Reed as Franklin * Bill Melendez as Snoopy and Woodstock This is the last TV special that uses the same cast from Snoopy, Come Home, You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown, and There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown.

3195539	A Charlie Brown Valentine	A Charlie Brown Valentine is the 40th animated television special based on characters from the Charles M. Schulz comic strip Peanuts. It features the Peanuts characters during the week leading up to Valentine's Day. It is the second Valentine's Day-themed Peanuts special, following Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown (1975). Initially broadcast February 14, 2002 on ABC, A Charlie Brown Valentine was the first new Peanuts special to air on television since 1994's You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown, and the first original special to be televised since Schulz's death in February 2000. == Plot == thumb|240px|left|Snoopy steals a kiss from his owner in A Charlie Brown Valentine This special begins with Charlie Brown sitting on a bench at lunch, trying to get the nerve to talk to the Little Red Haired Girl, but of course, chickening out. He says he feels silly to chicken out, because he knows he is the type of person she would like. The Little Red Haired Girl walks by, and drops her pencil. Charlie Brown notices it, picks it up, and sees it has teethmarks. He realizes, this means she nibbles on her pencil, and is human. Charlie Brown wants to use the Little Red Haired Girl's lost pencil as an excuse to talk to her while returning it to her, but unfortunately, Lucy takes the pencil from Charlie Brown and returns it to the Little Red Haired Girl before Charlie Brown has a chance to. Later that day, Charlie Brown buys an inexpensive box of chocolates for the Little Red Haired Girl, and decides to hide behind a tree and give it to her, commenting Love makes you do strange things. Throughout the cartoon Sally Brown tries to make Linus like her but to no avail. As shown after the title card screen, Sally tells Linus that if she holds out her hands, Linus can put a Valentine (or any sort of Valentine gift; like a box of chocolates) in them. Linus replies to her that (trying to avoid her) she can stand like that for the rest of her life forever and never get anything. The next day, Marcie is seen making a Valentine's card for Charlie Brown, and telling Peppermint Patty that she is very fond of him. Later that day, Marcie goes over to Charlie Brown's house to ask him if he likes her, and all Charlie Brown says is, "Do I what?". Marcie then walks away, angry. Later, Charlie Brown receives a letter saying "I know you like me and I like you". Charlie Brown gets very excited thinking it's from the Little Red Haired Girl, but Peppermint Patty yells at him, telling him "That letter was from me. You like me, Chuck". She leaves Charlie Brown standing there, saying "I do?". And the next day Marcie calls Charlie Brown to ask him if he likes her, and he gets confused again. Charlie Brown buys the Little Red Haired Girl a valentine, and then he wants to practice giving it to her. He tells Snoopy to pretend to be the little Red Haired Girl while he practices delivering the valentine. When Charlie Brown knocks on his door (while practicing), Snoopy answers with a wig on, which annoys Charlie Brown. Charlie Brown still does not know what to do about the Little Red Haired Girl. Linus suggests Charlie Brown should invite her to the school Valentine's Day dance. Charlie Brown agrees, but first asks Linus to talk to her to find out if she likes him. Linus goes over and asks her if she likes Charlie Brown. However, the Little Red Haired girl does not notice there was a kid in their class named Charlie Brown. Later, in class, Charlie Brown tries to impress the Little Red Haired Girl by winking at her. However, before she can notice him, the teacher sends Charlie Brown to the nurse because she thinks he is winking because his eye hurts him. The next day, Valentine's Day, Charlie Brown notices the Little Red Haired Girl handing out valentines. He gets excited that she might give him a valentine, but becomes discouraged when she does not give him one. Later, when Charlie Brown and Linus are at the wall, Linus suggests that Charlie Brown calls her to invite her to the Valentine's Day dance. Charlie Brown says he cannot because he is worried she might hang up in his face. Linus tells him that is the beauty of calling on the phone. If she hangs up on one ear, that is not considered the whole face. Later, Charlie Brown with Linus dials on the phone, attempting to call the Girl. However, on the other side of the line, Marcie picks up. Charlie Brown realizes he dialed the wrong number. He tells that to Marcie, and Marcie says she understands, and she thinks he probably meant to call Peppermint Patty. She tells him lucky for him, that Patty is here. She gives the phone to Patty. Peppermint Patty asks Charlie Brown if he called to invite her to his school's Valentine's dance, but before Charlie Brown can answer her, she accepts the offer. That night, Charlie Brown puts on a suit, because he has to go to the ball with Peppermint Patty. He goes to feed Snoopy first, but Snoopy puts on a bowtie and goes with him. When they arrive at the party, Charlie Brown is told that Snoopy can not come in because dogs are not allowed at this party. Charlie Brown tells a lie to the host that Snoopy is really a kid who comes dressed as a dog because he thinks it was a costume party, so Snoopy is allowed. At the party, Charlie Brown sees Linus, and Linus tells him the Little Red Haired Girl is at the party, so he should ask her to dance with him. Although Charlie Brown decides Linus is right, and starts walking towards the Little Red Haired Girl, getting more nervous with every step he takes, but before he could make it over to her, Peppermint Patty and Marcie find him, and start dancing with him, much to Charlie Brown's annoyance, and when the two girls finally let him go, Charlie Brown realizes the Little Red Haired Girl is already dancing with somebody else, so that somebody else is Snoopy. After the dance, Peppermint Patty and Marcie complain to Charlie Brown that he is not a good date, as he is a horrible dancer. They also ask that he does not invite them to any more dances. Charlie Brown is upset because he did not get to dance with the Little Red Haired Girl and did not receive a single valentine. Snoopy brings Charlie Brown a valentine. ==Voice actors== * Wesley Singerman - Charlie Brown/Eudora *Corey Padnos - Linus van Pelt *Lauren Schaffel - Lucy van Pelt *Nicolette Little - Sally Brown *Jessica D.

Schulz. It also marked the third time a Peanuts special was animated with digital ink and paint as opposed to traditional cel animation (the first one to do so was It Was My Best Birthday Ever, Charlie Brown in 1997.) It also utilized the drawing style similar to the comic strip, with a white outline around Lucy's short hair and Snoopy's long ears (this was dropped in future specials). A Charlie Brown Valentine also depicts the Little Red-Haired Girl in full view, though she remains unnamed in this special, in contrast to her first full-view appearance in It's Your First Kiss, Charlie Brown (1977) when she was named Heather. She also does not resemble the "Heather" version in any way; that version last appeared in the 1988 special Snoopy!!! The Musical. ==Music score== The bulk of the music score in A Charlie Brown Valentine consists of classic melodies composed by Vince Guaraldi, some tunes which had only been utilized once ("Heartburn Waltz"). Other more notable tunes, such as "Charlie Brown Theme", "Peppermint Patty" and a jazz/rock version of the franchise signature tune, "Linus and Lucy", were used as well. All themes were performed and arranged by David Benoit. #"Heartburn Waltz" (version 1) #"Peppermint Patty" (version 1) #"Pebble Beach" (version 1) #"Linus and Lucy" #"Blue Charlie Brown" #"Heartburn Waltz" (version 2) #"Heartburn Waltz" (version 3) #"Peppermint_Patty" (version 2) #"Heartburn Waltz" (version 4) #"Oh, Good Grief" (version 1) (Vince Guaraldi, Lee Mendelson) #"Heartburn Waltz" (version 5) #"Pebble Beach" (version 2) #"Heartburn Waltz" (version 6) #"You're in Love, Charlie Brown" (version 1) #"Heartburn Waltz" (version 7) #"Charlie Brown Theme" (version 1) (Vince Guaraldi, Lee Mendelson) #"Oh, Good Grief" (version 2) (Vince Guaraldi, Lee Mendelson) #"Heartburn Waltz" (version 8) #"Charlie Brown Theme" (version 2) (Vince Guaraldi, Lee Mendelson) #"You're in Love, Charlie Brown" (version 2) #"Linus and Lucy" #"Oh, Good Grief" (version 3) (Vince Guaraldi, Lee Mendelson) #"Heartburn Waltz" (version 9) == Release == A Charlie Brown Valentine was first broadcast on February 14, 2002. The special was then released to VHS and DVD on January 6, 2004 along with two bonus specials, There's No Time for Love, Charlie Brown and Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown, retailing at $14.98. Although it originally aired on ABC, the network edits a few parts out to make time for station commercials, with the original version of the special being 25 minutes. In December 2010, Warner Home Video re-released the special on DVD with Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown as a bonus special. The special was added to Apple TV+ on February 9, 2023. == Reception == A Charlie Brown Valentine received an extremely positive response. When the special re-aired on February 8, 2008, it attracted 5.36 million viewers, placing it at #2 on the primetime TV ratings for that night. In 2009, it was re-aired by ABC on Valentine's Day, immediately after Be My Valentine, Charlie Brown. In 2010, it was viewed by 7.51 million viewers coming 2nd in the timeslot.TV Ratings: Wednesday Overnight Nielsen Ratings- Human Target ratings, American Idol ratings, Ugly Betty ratings, Mercy ratings, Law & Order: SVU ratings, Modern Family rating... == References == ==External links== * Category:Peanuts television specials Category:2002 television specials Category:American Broadcasting Company television specials Category:Television shows directed by Bill Melendez Category:2000s American television specials Category:2000s animated television specials Category:Valentine's Day television specials
44217253	A Charm of Lullabies	A Charm of Lullabies, Op.41 is a song cycle for mezzo-soprano with piano accompaniment by Benjamin Britten. It consists of five songs composed on poems by William Blake, Robert Burns, Robert Greene, Thomas Randolph and John Phillip. It was written in 1947 for Nancy Evans, who gave the first performance with Felix de Nobel (piano) at a festival in The Hague 3 January 1948. The score was first published in 1949 by Boosey and Hawkes in London. A performance of the cycle takes about 12 minutes. The variety of texts lends itself to variety of music, and questions the concept of 'lullaby'; especially the fourth song, "A Charm", which humorously threatens the child with all sorts of torment if it doesn't go to sleep. == The songs == # William Blake (17571827)"A Cradle Song" (Poems from the Notebook, 1794, verses 12 and 45 only)This version of the poem differs from the one of the same name in Blake's Songs of Innocence and of Experience. # Robert Burns (175996)"A Highland Balou" (Last Songs for the Scots Musical Museum, 1792.

13029312	A Chart of Biography	thumb|right|320px|A redacted version of Priestley's Chart of Biography (1765) In 1765, 18th-century British polymath Joseph Priestley published A Chart of Biography and its accompanying prose description as a supplement to his Lectures on History and General Policy.Priestley, Joseph. A Chart of Biography. London: J. Johnson, St. Paul's Church Yard, 1765 and Joseph Priestley, A description of a chart of biography. [Warrington] : Printed at Warrington, 1764; A Description of a Chart of Biography. Warrington: Printed by William Eyres, 1765. Priestley believed that the chart and A New Chart of History (1769) would allow students to "trace out distinctly the dependence of events to distribute them into such periods and divisions as shall lay the whole claim of past transactions in a just and orderly manner."Qtd. in Sheps, 141-2. The Chart of Biography covers a vast timespan, from 1200 BC to 1800 AD, and includes two thousand names. Priestley organized his list into six categories: Statesman and Warriors; Divines and Metaphysicians; Mathematicians and Physicians (natural philosophers were placed here); Poets and Artists; Orators and Critics (prose fiction authors were placed here); and Historians and Antiquarians (lawyers were placed here). Priestley's "principle of selection" was fame, not merit; therefore, as he mentions, the chart is a reflection of current opinion. He also wanted to ensure that his readers would recognize the entries on the chart. Priestley had difficulty assigning all of the people listed to individual categories; he attempted to list them in the category under which their most important work had been done. Machiavelli is therefore listed as a historian rather than a statesman and Cicero is listed as a statesman instead of an orator. The chart was also arranged in order of importance; "statesmen are placed on the lower margin, where they are easier to see, because they are the names most familiar to readers."Sheps, 144.McLachlan, 253; Sheps, 142-5. Both Charts were popular for decades—the A New Chart of History went through fifteen editions by 1816.Gibbs, 37. The trustees of Warrington were so impressed with Priestley's lectures and charts that they arranged for the University of Edinburgh to grant him a Doctor of Law degree in 1764.Schofield, 118-9. ==Notes== ==Bibliography== *McLachlan, John.

6267981	A Chaste Maid in Cheapside	A Chaste Maid in Cheapside is a city comedy written c. 1613 by the English Renaissance playwright Thomas Middleton. Unpublished until 1630, and long- neglected afterwards, it is now considered among the best and most characteristic Jacobean comedies. The play was originally staged by the Lady Elizabeth's Men.E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 volumes, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, p. 441. The 1630 quarto was published by the bookseller Francis Constable. ==Plot== The play presents multiple plots centred on the marriage of Moll Yellowhammer, the titular maid, who is daughter to a wealthy Cheapside goldsmith, and, in particular, her intended husband, Sir Walter Whorehound. Moll loves Touchwood Junior, a poor gallant; her father, however, has betrothed her to Whorehound, a philandering knight eager for Moll's dowry. As a kind of side-bargain, Sir Walter has promised Moll's brother Tim a "landed niece" from Wales. Tim, a fatuous scholar, returns to London from Cambridge University with his Latin tutor. This "landed niece" is in reality one of Sir Walter's mistresses, who has no land in actuality. Sir Walter is also having an affair with the wife of Allwit, a knowing cuckold, his name an inversion of "wittol," who lives happily on the money Sir Walter gives his wife. Meanwhile, Touchwood Senior (the elder brother of Moll's true love) prepares to depart from his wife; prodigiously fertile, he impregnates any woman he sleeps with. He and his wife must separate to avoid another pregnancy, which they cannot afford. His salvation comes from the Kixes, an aging couple who have not been able to conceive. This is important because if they have a child, Sir Walter (a relation of theirs) will not inherit their fortune, on which he has confidently depended, going so far as to live beyond his means. A maid tells the Kixes that Touchwood makes a special fertility potion; Touchwood deceives his way into the bed of Lady Kix. After an abortive attempt to elope with Touchwood Junior, Moll is guarded at home. The day before the wedding, Moll flees her parents' home again. Caught while attempting to cross the Thames, she is drenched and seems to fall ill upon being brought home. Touchwood Junior and Sir Walter fight in the street, and both are wounded. Sir Walter believes that he is near death. At Allwit's house, he repents all of his sins, condemning the Allwits for indulging him. When news is brought that Lady Kix is pregnant (thus ruining Sir Walter's prospects), the Allwits eject him and plan to sell all Sir Walter's gifts and move to a home in The Strand. Moll remains very ill; when Touchwood Senior brings word that his brother has died, she faints and appears to die while Susan, her servant, is let in on a secret plan. Saddened, the Yellowhammers agree to Touchwood Senior's request that the young lovers receive a joint burial. At the funeral, Moll and Touchwood Junior rise from their coffins and the mourning turns to celebration. The two are wed, as Tim and the Welsh "niece" had been earlier that day; Kix promises to support the family of Touchwood Senior, who announces that Sir Walter has been imprisoned for debt. All exit, headed for a celebratory dinner. ==Stage history== The play's title page states that it was acted at the Swan Theatre by Lady Elizabeth's Men. There is no evidence that the play was revived during the Restoration period, or that it was staged in any form between then and the twentieth century. A very limited excerpt from the play, titled A Posy for the Ring for the occasion, was acted at Earls Court on 16 September 1912. Productions of the full play were presented at Harvard University and at Leeds University in 1956; multiple other stagings have occurred from the early 1960s on,Thomas Middleton, The Selected Plays of Thomas Middleton, edited by David L. Frost, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1978; pp. 91–2. and the play is now Middleton's third most staged play, after The Changeling and Women Beware Women.Linda Woodbridge, intro. to Chaste Maid in Thomas Middleton: Collected Works (Oxford, 2007). ==References== ==External links== * Full text of the play, including notes and illustrations Category:English Renaissance plays Category:1610s plays Category:Plays by Thomas Middleton

"The whole point of A Chef's Life is to showcase the people and traditions of Eastern North Carolina, not some version of them gussied up for TV." A 2018 Jezebel article titled "The Future of Food TV Is Female" parallels Samin Nosrat's Netflix show Salt Fat Acid Heat to Vivian Howard's PBS series A Chef's Life. Writer Megan Reynolds acknowledges the two shows' similarities by saying: "What differentiates Nosrat and Howard's shows from the men-hosted series is, of course, that they are women and are cleverly using their womanhood to subvert the expectations of what food television can and should be like. Traditionally, women on food TV are chained to a marble island in a large, well-appointed home, cooking a meal for their families in tightly-edited, half-hour bites. [...] Nosrat and Howard free themselves from the kitchen and go out into the world, just like the men would, but are kinder, more compassionate, and much more compelling." ==References== ==External links== * * A Chef's Life – official site Category:PBS original programming Category:2013 American television series debuts Category:2018 American television series endings Category:2010s American cooking television series Category:Cuisine of the Southern United States Category:Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Culinary Program winners Category:Peabody Award-winning television programs Category:North Carolina culture
68386593	A Chemist Lifting with Extreme Precaution the Cuticle of a Grand Piano	A Chemist Lifting with Extreme Precaution the Cuticle of a Grand Piano (Catalan: Un farmacèutic aixecant amb extrema precaució la cutícula d'un piano de cua) (Spanish: Farmacéutico levantando con suma precaución la cutícula de un piano de cola) is a 1936 oil painting by artist Salvador Dalí. The painting is an example of Dalí's distinctive, avant-garde brand of surrealism as well as a curious example of Dalí's mysterious relationship with Judaism. ==Description== The painting is set on a barren, mute landscape with a mostly monochromatic color scheme. To the left, the painting's titular character, the Chemist, has one leg on a rock and is lifting the edge of a grand piano which blends into the landscape. The instrument appears to have the consistency of a piece of cloth as if it has melted into the ground, no longer a solid object; this a quintessentially surrealist technique which appears prominently in many of Dalí's works, including The Persistence of Memory. The painting was originally titled, Instantaneous presence of Louis II of Bavaria, Salvador Dalí, Lenin, and Wagner on the beach at Rosas, which sheds light on the identities of the characters present in the painting; the original titular figures were described by Dalí as "all the real and fantastic personages of the modern tragedy" – although many of them are admittedly difficult to distinguish with certainty in the painting's current form. In the center of the painting sits German composer Richard Wagner in his distinctive beret-and- robe regalia. The ashen-faced man in the forefront depicted laying down and reading a newspaper bears a resemblance to Vladimir Lenin, a possible nod to surrealism's Communist underpinnings, and the Chemist is Friedrich Nietzsche, another intellectual Dalí admired. Just beside Wagner stands a small boy carrying a hoop and stick, accoutrements used in a children's game known as hoop rolling, who is looking across the landscape at a woman garbed in a white dress out in the distance. And in the far right of the painting stands an African woman with pink, flowery hair wearing an orange dress staring in the direction of the Chemist. The largely monotone color scheme juxtaposes the vibrant, almost holy, bright aura of yellow light surrounding Wagner, as well as a bright blue patch of sky in the upper right-hand corner visible through the clouds. ==Dalí, Wagner, and Judaism== ===Dalí's Admiration for Wagner=== Wagner was Dalí's favorite composer, and the painters connection to Wagner was personal and deeply rooted. As a child, Dalí would listen as his father sat by the family phonograph listening to Lohengrin – while Dalí's uncle, Anselm Domènech, was active in the Barcelona Wagner Association. In adulthood the infatuation continued, and even today a dozen or so recordings of Wagner's operas can be seen at the Dalí Castle in Púbol, as well as an eight-track tape of Wagner's Greatest Hits; moreover, the castle garden sports an ornate fountain inlayed with dozens of small busts of the composer he so admired. One of Dalí's especially beloved tracks, an old scratched record of Tristan und Isolde, played constantly, and was playing on the day Dalí died in 1989. ===Wagner's Antisemitism and Dalí's Complicated Relationship with Judaism=== Even prior to Hitler's rise to power, Wagner was a well-known racist and antisemite. As German author Jens Malte Fischer once quipped, "If you didn't know in the 1870s and 1880s that Wagner was a staunch anti-Semite, then you must have been pretty much deaf and blind." Dalí's perennial obsession with Wagner – in addition to explicit Hitlerian iconography in some of his later works, such as in The Enigma of Hitler – led many to believe that Dalí himself harbored antisemitic views or had fascist sympathies. In addition to his love of Wagner and several fascist allusions in his paintings, Dalí publicly revealed several of his mystical, homoerotic fever dreams about Hitler: just before World War II, Dalí mused that “I often dreamed of Hitler as a woman” and later in his autobiography confessed that "Hitler turned me on in the highest." Dalí's fellow Surrealists, a group composed almost entirely of politically active Communists and anti-fascists, were not amused with these antics. Finally, one of their prominent members, Andre Breton, accused Dali of glorifying Hitler, and promptly expelled him from the group. This explicit fascist iconography and bizarre dalliance with Hitler, however, seemingly juxtaposes Dalí's relationship with Judaism in his later years. Dalí produced a surprising, yet remarkable corpus of Jewish works that differs widely from his other work.“Emory Scholar Speaks on Artist Salvador Dali, Judaism.” Associated Press State Wire: South Carolina (SC), 28 Jan. 2016. In 1968, Dalí produced a series of 25 lithographs entitled Aliyah, the Rebirth of Israel to celebrate the 20th anniversary of Israel's independence – Aliyah is a Hebrew word that literally means "migration to the land of Israel." David R. Blumenthal, Professor of Judaic Studies at Emory University, described the paintings in the following way: It is widely circulated that Dalí's mother's family, the Domènech of Barcelona, had Jewish roots, but scholars agree this is not true. However, despite Dalí's lack of a personal connection to Judaism, it is clear that his work succeeded in capturing a 'Jewish essence' that resonated strongly with his new audience. Dalí would go on to produce many more Jewish works. In 1971, Dalí created Song of Songs of Solomon, a portfolio of 12 drypoint etchings plus color and gold dust. That same year, Dalí produced another series of 13 vibrant etchings with color stencil in his work The Twelve Tribes of Israel – then again in 1975 with Moses and Monotheism. Dalí's true views regarding Judaism and antisemitism remain the subject of the debate. Some believe that Dalí's later work represents a transformative supernova in his relationship with "the Jew" and Judaism, revealing, in a way, a spiritual connection or at the very least a profound empathy for the Jewish people. Conversely, some maintain his Jewish paintings represent a deceitful attempt to tap into a new, wealthy market for his artwork – constituting an elaborate ploy to exploit the Jews for commercial benefit. Nonetheless, these artworks, and particularly A Chemist Lifting with Extreme Precaution the Cuticle of a Grand Piano, represent, perhaps, that early conflict between Dalí's unconscious fascist sympathies, manifested in his deification of Wagner, and his profound Jewish empathy, exemplified by his later work and the abiding pluralism of the eccentric and bizarre surrealist. ==See also== * List of works by Salvador Dalí ==References== Category:1936 paintings Category:Oil on canvas paintings Category:Paintings by Salvador Dalí Category:Paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago Category:Musical instruments in art

The site's critical consensus reads, "A willingness to sidestep clichés and a skilled central performance help A Chiara stand out in the crowded coming-of-age genre." On review aggregator Metacritic, the film holds a rating of 75 out of 100 based on 18 critic reviews, indicating "generally favourable reviews". In a positive review for Variety, Jay Weissberg wrote that "A Chiara allows Carpignano an opportunity to turn his generous gaze on another ignored segment of Calabrian society, one whose values — family, mutual support — can't be dismissed because we're uncomfortable with how they exist side-by-side with a sense of ethics that stops at the bounds of kinship." He also praised the cinematography and original score, saying "Tim Curtin's dynamic camera is attuned to Chiara's teenage energy without going overboard, playing on a liminal balance between security and imbalance. Carpignano uses music to even more forcefully reflect Chiara's life, though its omnipresence risks driving the film's moods rather than eliding with them." The Hollywood Reporters David Rooney called the film Carpignano's "most accomplished and affecting film to date" and "a companion piece that takes rewarding new turns" in another positive review.
