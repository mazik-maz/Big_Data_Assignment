Atlantic / Rhino. 2017. Producer Nick Patrick said of the album: "There is a reason that Aretha Franklin is called the 'Queen of Soul.' There is nothing more exciting than that incredible voice taking you on an emotional roller coaster ride through her amazing repertoire of songs. To have the opportunity to work with that voice on this project has been the greatest honor and to hear a symphony orchestra wrapped around those performances is breathtaking." Franklin died in August 2018, nine months after the album's release. ==Track listing== All Tracks produced by Nick Patrick and Don Reedman, with background vocal production assisted by Greg Field. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from AllmusicAretha Franklin with Royal Philharmonic Orchestra. “A Brand New Me”.
