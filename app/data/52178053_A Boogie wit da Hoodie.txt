He is signed to Atlantic Records, as well as his own label imprint, Highbridge the Label.

Dubose was raised in Highbridge and began rapping at age twelve after listening to Kanye West and 50 Cent. He attended Dewitt Clinton High School, where he expanded upon rapping during his freshman year, engaging in cyphers at lunchtime by performing rhymes he had already written and stored in a large notebook he carried with him. Remarking on his time in high school to XXL, he said "I was regular, everybody really noticed me. I was the one in the back of the classroom, quiet." Growing up, Dubose frequently got into legal trouble, mainly for selling cannabis and narcotics. After finding out what he was doing, Dubose's parents sent him to Florida as punishment. He attended Fort Pierce Central in Fort Pierce, Florida. In Florida, Dubose was kept under house arrest. During this confinement, he began to work on his artistry, starting off by tweaking his self-composed rhymes and gradually leading one thing to another. He even built an amateur studio inside the apartment that he lived in. Following his high school graduation, Dubose continued to focus on his music while working jobs in different, sectors including construction and pizza delivery. ==Career== ===2015–2016: Career beginnings=== Dubose's official discography began with the single "Temporary", which he released on SoundCloud. He was just nineteen at the time of its release. The song lacked good rhythm and flow, which is usually required for a good hip-hop number. Myster Whyte, who he met in Florida and produced the song, showed A Boogie the inside of his first professional studio. He asked A Boogie to work with a trainer until he got his techniques right. Dubose's said, "I used to record songs like, play the beat from one phone and have another phone recording me and just rap. Moving from that to a studio was like, 'Damn, I never knew I could sound like this'. It was just magic". The training sessions with Myster helped progress his sound. In 2015, Dubose moved back to New York in an attempt to start making hip hop his full-time career. He, Don Q, Quincy "QP" Acheampong, and Bubba then created Highbridge the Label and set up a home studio. A Boogie released his first full-length project, a mixtape titled Artist, in February 2016, which launched his career and was on Forbes list of up-and-coming rappers. The mixtape was recorded during a time where Dubose was dealing with a difficult break-up which helped influence the mixtape and Dubose's future sound all together. Dubose then released a collaborative project, alongside fellow Highbridge-based rapper Don Q, titled Highbridge the Label: The Takeover Vol.1, on May 18, 2016. Dubose went on to have three opening dates on Drake and Future's Summer Sixteen Tour. Dubose was also co-signed by Drake. In July 2016, A Boogie signed a deal with Atlantic Records. In September 2016, he was featured on the BET Hip Hop Awards cypher alongside Don Q, Russ, Kent Jones and Nick Grant. Later in October 2016, A Boogie released his first extended play (EP), titled TBA, in acronym for "The Bigger Artist".
