Ian Wolf of Anime UK News scored the series 8 out of 10, describing the Sisters story arc as having a "lack of imagination" despite being told in a different approach (from Misaka's viewpoint rather than Kamijo's) but finding its story "feel[ing] a lot more emotional". ===Scientific accuracy=== Tsukasa Kano, a science writer who graduated from Nihon University and member of the Space Authors Club, discussed human cloning in A Certain Scientific Railgun S. He stated that there is a possibility but currently impractical due to the low yield rate among humans, while contradicted the 14-day development of a clone to a full appearance of a junior high school student as depicted in the series since it naturally needs to grow for up to 14 years, which requires 80,000 eggs harvested from people and 80,000 women to serve as "borrowed bellies" for impregnation. ==Other media== A puzzle game by ASCII Media Works based on A Certain Scientific Railgun S, titled A Certain Scientific Railgun S Puzzle, was released on July 26, 2013.
