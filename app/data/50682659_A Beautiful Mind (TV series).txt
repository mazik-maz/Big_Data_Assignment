A Beautiful Mind () is a South Korean television series starring Jang Hyuk, Park So-dam, Yoon Hyun-min and Park Se-young. It aired from June 20 to August 8, 2016, on KBS2's Mondays and Tuesdays at 22:00 KST time slot. Though the drama had its supporters, the number of episodes were brought down to 14, from the planned 16 due to low viewership ratings. ==Synopsis== Inspired by Mary Shelley's gothic novel Frankenstein, it tells the story of a world-renowned but unsympathetic neurosurgeon and his involvement with the mysterious deaths in the hospital he works in. ==Cast== ===Main=== * Jang Hyuk as Lee Young-oh :36 years old assistant professor at the department of neurology in Hyunsung hospital.
