A Boy Named 68818 is a true-life account of Israel "Srulik" Stark in the Holocaust, his spiritual resistance, and rebuilding afterwards, written by his daughter, Miriam (Stark) Miller. Aimed for children aged 10â€“14 as well as adults, the book was published in 2015 and distributed by Feldheim Publishers. It was praised by several Jewish and Holocaust memorial organizations. == Outline == The story of the book is divided into three sections, each one prefaced with a Holocaust related poem. The first section, titled Fledgling, describes Stark's life before the outbreak of World War II, living his early years in Podhoryan near Munkacs. The author created for him fictional pet dove named "Taibele" as a device for the protagonist to share his thoughts. The first section concludes with the Jewish community of Carpatho-Ruthenia's deportation to Auschwitz in mid-1944. The story's second section talks about Stark's ordeals in the Holocaust, from the grueling slave labor in Auschwitz, Mauthausen and Melk to the death march to Ebensee. In Part Three, the book tells about recovering and rebuilding after the Holocaust, with Stark's emigration to the United States. Throughout the story, there are full-color illustrations by Gadi Pollack and Alex Firley. At the end of the book are over 130 pages of Appendices: a glossary; a historical overview of Europe between 1914 and 1948; a timeline of events and maps, tracing Stark's life as well as the region's Jewish history at that time in general; an explanation to of the book's illustrations; a learning guide, extracting lessons in history, geography, phsycolgy, Judaism, etc. from the story; and "Srulik's Personal Album", photographs of Stark, his family, and related objects. == Reception == The book received much praise from Jewish and Holocaust Memorial organizations.
