A Cabinet of Curiosities is a compilation box set by alternative rock band Jane's Addiction, released on April 21, 2009, on Rhino Records. == Background == The collection includes three discs of demos, rehearsals, remixes, covers, and live recordings from the group's initial lifespan of 1986â€“1991, and one DVD featuring the movie Soul Kiss, the band's music videos, and concert footage. Vocalist Perry Farrell stated that "it's a really nice, fetishy object." In 2009, vocalist Perry Farrell stated that "[the] box set was supposed to be released two years ago. It just took so long. We cut that deal on the box set when we were still together on the last record, and it took that long to get it co-ordinated and gathered and all those other things and it was just kind of a happenstance that we were together at this time. When Rhino saw that we were together they thought, 'Let's just really work day and night and get the thing out.'" == Track listing == * indicates previously unreleased tracks === Disc 1 === # "Jane Says (Radio Tokyo Demo)" * # "Pigs in Zen (Radio Tokyo Demo)" # "Mountain Song (Radio Tokyo Demo)" # "Had a Dad (Radio Tokyo Demo)" # "I Would for You (Radio Tokyo Demo)" # "Idiots Rule (Demo)" * # "Classic Girl (Demo)" * # "Up the Beach (Demo)" * # "Suffer Some (Demo)" * # "Thank You Boys (Demo)" * # "Summertime Rolls (Demo)" * # "City (Demo)" * # "Ocean Size (Demo)" * # "Stop!
