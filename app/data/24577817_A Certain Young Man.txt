Castmember Willard Louis died a few months after filming wrapped, and his name was removed from the credits.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0018754/trivia ==Release== A Certain Young Man opened to reviews that were lukewarm at best, and was a financial failure at the box office. Some screenings were preceded by the Technicolor short The Czarina's Secret featuring Sally Rand and Olga Baclanova. The film's release followed on the heels of A Gentleman of Paris with Adolph Menjou, which was based on the same source material and was considered a better adaptation. Novarro's performance was unfavorably compared with that of Menjou by several critics,Soares, André; Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramon Novarro; St. Martin's Press, New York, 2002; p. 132-133 including Mordaunt Hall of the New York Times, who found the overall film "only mildly amusing and very shallow," though he found Myers "charming" and work by supporting actors Huntley Gordon and Bert Roach "favorable." Personally, Novarro hated the film and his performance. In an interview in the April 1931 issue of Modern Screen, he said "In acting, in directing, in everything — I want to be 'definite'. Even when I am later proven wrong — it will at least have been so definite that I myself know it. I am responsible for the worst performance that has ever been given on the screen. It was in A Certain Young Man and it was terrible. I am mortally ashamed of it — yet I'd rather have been bad than just fair."Soares, André, Beyond Paradise: The Life of Ramon Novarro (New York: St. Martin's Press, 2002) p. 133 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1928 comedy films Category:1928 films Category:Films directed by Hobart Henley Category:Lost American films Category:Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films Category:American silent feature films Category:Films based on British novels Category:American black-and-white films Category:Silent American comedy films Category:1928 lost films Category:Lost comedy films Category:1920s American films
