A Bug and a Bag of Weed is a 2006 comedy film directed by David Gonella and starring Sebastian Spence, Chris Cuthbertson, and Drew Hagen. ==Plot== Peter Jordan is 31 years old, $35,000 in debt, and he's been working at Super Duper Computers for seven long years. Together with his equally down-on-their-luck co-workers Stan and Willie, Peter dreams of escaping the daily drudgery of "don't forget to sell the extended warranty", and "if you have time to lean, you have time to clean". Peter's existence in Big Box Retail Commission hell is further fueled by rival Salesman Rommel who steals Peter's customers and computer sales behind his back. Just when things seem to be at their worst, Peter's long lost high school buddy Frehley blows into town and turns Peter, Stan and Willie's humdrum lives into a non-stop beer-soaked party, full of loud music, strip clubs, and beautiful girls! And with Frehley yelling "You only live once!", Peter whips out the credit cards to buy his dream car, a classic Volkswagen Beetle. But when Frehley suddenly splits town, straight- laced Peter and his buddies are shocked to find themselves left with a massive hockey bag stuffed full of primo weed. ==Cast== == Production and release == In a 2003 announcement with Playback, Jason Priestly, Bif Naked, Robb Wells, and John Paul Tremblay were originally slated to star in the film, which was also to have a budget of one million dollars and was to screen at the Atlantic Film Festival in 2003.
