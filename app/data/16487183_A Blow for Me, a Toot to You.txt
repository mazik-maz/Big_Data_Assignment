A Blow for Me, a Toot to You is a 1977 album by funk musician Fred Wesley and the Horny Horns featuring Maceo Parker. ==Reception== The album contains heavy participation by the P-Funk musical collective, including Garry Shider, Michael Hampton, and Jerome Brailey. The album also contains the heavily sampled track "Four Play" which, due to its title, prevented the track from garnering airplay when it was released as a single. The album was produced by George Clinton and Bootsy Collins, and was reissued in 1993, first by P-Vine records in Japan, then by Sequel Records in the UK, and lastly AEM in the U.S.. The reissue contains two new remixes of the tracks "Four Play" and "A Blow for Me, a Toot to You", as well as an interview with George Clinton discussing the recording's background. Years later, WEA released both Horny Horns albums on a two-CD set, in the UK. ==Track listing== ===Bonus tracks on the CD reissue=== ==Personnel== *Fred Wesley (trombone), Maceo Parker (saxophone), Rick Gardner (trumpet), Richard "Kush" Griffith (trumpet) - horns *Brecker Brothers - additional horns *Jerome Brailey, Frankie "Kash" Waddy, Bootsy Collins - drums *Glenn Goins, Garry Shider, Michael Hampton, Bootsy Collins, Phelps Collins - guitar *Bootsy Collins - bass *Bernie Worrell - keyboards *Fred Wesley, Maceo Parker, Rick Gardner, Richard Griffith, George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, Gary "Mudbone" Cooper, Lynn Mabry, Dawn Silva, Taka Khan, Bernie Worrell, Phelps Collins, Randy Crawford, Robert "P-Nut" Johnson - vocals ;Technical *Jim Callon, Jim Vitti - engineer *Ronald "Stozo" Edwards - cover illustration ==Charts== Chart (1977) Peak position Billboard Pop Albums 181 Billboard Top Soul Albums 31 ===Singles=== Year Single Chart positions US R&B; 1977 "Up For The Down Stroke" 93 ==Samples and covers== *Gang Starr sampled "Four Play" for the title track of their album Step in the Arena (1991). *Raw Fusion sampled "Peace Fugue" on their song "Freaky Note", on their album Hoochiefied Funk (1994). *Nas sampled "Peace Fugue" on his song "Life We Chose", on his album Nastradamus (1999). *Digital Underground sampled "Four Play" on their song "Packet Man", on their album Sex Packets (1990). ==External links== * Fred Wesley and the Horny Horns-A Blow for Me, a Toot to You at Discogs ==References== *What It Is!
